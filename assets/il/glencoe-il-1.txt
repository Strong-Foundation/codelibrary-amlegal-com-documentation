PREFACE
   This volume constitutes the first revision and codification of the general
ordinances of the Village of Glencoe, Illinois, since 1929. It contains the
Charter and ordinances of a general and permanent nature passed on or before
May 1, 1965, as were found desirable for retention, except those expressly
saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance.
   A feature to which the attention of the user is directed is the arrangement
of the chapters in alphabetical order. Attention is also directed to the
analysis preceding each chapter which, in many instances, will serve as an
index within itself. The general index, carried at the beginning of the Code,
has been carefully prepared and will serve as an accurate medium for locating
the individual sections of law within the Code. References to the Charter and
the applicable state law will be found in the references appearing throughout
the Code. These notes also contain cross-references to other and related
provisions in the Village Code itself. By reference to the historical
citations, appearing at the end of each section, the user will be able to
ascertain the ordinance or the section of the 1929 Code from which the present
section has been derived. The absence of a citation indicates new material
becoming effective on the effective date of the Code.
   It is a recognized fact that if any Code is to accomplish its intended
purpose it must be kept up to date by means of an adequate supplemental
service.

ARTICLE VII. PSEBA POLICY AND PROCEDURES
§ 2-157 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to provide a fair and efficient method of
determining the eligibility of an applicant for health insurance benefits
pursuant to the Public Safety Employee Benefits Act (820 ILCS 320/1 et seq.)
(“PSEBA”). This article is consistent with the obligations of the village under
state law to provide health insurance benefits to certain public safety
employees who qualify for, and are determined by the village to be eligible to
receive, continued health insurance coverage under the village’s basic group
health insurance plan pursuant to PSEBA.
(Ord. No. 2020-08-3474)
§ 2-158 APPLICATION PROCESS AND INITIAL REVIEW.
   All applications for benefits pursuant to PSEBA must be submitted and will
be considered according to the following process:
   (a)   Application form. Any person seeking PSEBA benefits from the village
(“applicant”) must complete and submit to the village the standard application
form prepared by the village, and all supporting documentation required by the
application. The PSEBA application must be completed, sworn, and notarized as
to the content of the application.
   (b)   Time period for submission of application. The completed application
for PSEBA benefits must be submitted either by hand delivery or certified mail
to the attention of the Village Manager, Village of Glencoe, 675 Village Court,
Glencoe, Illinois, 60022, not later than one year after the date on which the
event took place for which the applicant claims to qualify for PSEBA benefits;
provided, however, the time to submit an application for an applicant who has
timely filed an application for pension benefits with the village’s police
pension fund board be the date that is 30 days after the date of any final
ruling by the applicable pension board concerning any duty-related disability.
   (c)   Processing of application. Upon receipt of a timely, complete, and
executed application form, the village manager or their designee shall promptly
review the materials and other relevant information necessary or appropriate to
analyze whether the applicant is eligible for PSEBA benefits. If the village
determines that additional fact-finding is necessary or appropriate, the
applicant will respond to a written request by the village for additional
information not later than 30 days after receipt of the village’s request. If
the applicant does not respond to or cooperate with the village’s written
request for additional information, the village will send a reminder notice to
the applicant explaining the duty of full cooperation in the fact-finding
process. If the applicant does not provide the requested information or
otherwise cooperate with the village within 21 days after receipt of such
additional notice, then the village may deem the application for PSEBA benefits
to be withdrawn and waived.
   (d)   Initial determination of eligibility by village manager. The village
manager or their designee will review the facts contained in the completed
application, supporting materials, and any other information gathered through
any additional fact-finding. If the village manager or their designee
determines based on this review that the applicant is eligible for PSEBA
benefits, the village manager or their designee will grant the applicant’s
request for benefits and coordinate the provision of benefits to the applicant
consistent with PSEBA’s requirements and § 2-160 of this article. If the
village manager or their designee determines that the applicant is not
qualified for PSEBA benefits, the application will be considered by the
village’s hearing officer at an administrative hearing pursuant to § 2-159 of
this article.

hypothecated. No license may descend by the laws of testate or intestate
succession. Every license ceases on the death, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the
licensee; except only that executors or administrators of the estate of any
deceased licensee and the trustee of the estate of any bankrupt or insolvent

violation within such period of time as the village shall direct.

§ 9-4 INSPECTIONS GENERALLY.
   (a)   The director of public works shall cause to be inspected all

   (b)   A final inspection shall be made upon the completion of any work done

director of public works, or any other building officer.
   (b)   On receipt of such stop order, it shall be unlawful to continue with
the work, except pumping or such other work as may be necessary to prevent

provisions of this chapter for such use or occupancy.
§ 9-7 CONFLICTS BETWEEN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC PROVISIONS.
   When a general provision or requirement of this chapter conflicts with a
specific provision relating to the construction, equipment or maintenance of

   (c)   In the event that the work, or condition, continues in defiance of
such verbal and written notices, or if the deviation is not promptly corrected,
then the deviation shall be deemed a willful violation, and the building
officer shall promptly stop the work until the provisions of this chapter are
complied with.
   (d)   The building officer and other officers of the village are hereby
authorized to use the police power of the village in such manner and to such

ARTICLE II. BUILDING PERMITS
§ 9-9 WHEN REQUIRED.
   Before proceeding with the erection, construction, alteration, repair,
removal or the excavation for any building or structure in the village, a
permit for such erection, construction, alteration, repair, removal or
excavation shall first be obtained by the owner or his or her agent from the
director of public works as provided in this article.
§ 9-10 TIME LIMIT; EXTENSION.
   (a)   A building permit shall expire if the work covered by the permit is
not commenced within six months after issuance of the permit or if the work is
not completed and a certificate of occupancy has not been issued within 15
months after issuance of the permit. No permit fees shall be refunded because
of the expiration of any permit, except as specifically provided in this
section.
   (b)   If an applicant fails to complete the work for which a building permit
has been issued within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section, the
applicant may request a six-month extension of the original permit. The
applicant shall be required to submit an application for a permit extension,
stating that the plans, specifications, and conditions included in the original
permit application required by §
9-12 have not changed. Upon receipt of a complete application and payment of a
permit extension, the code official shall grant the applicant a six-month
permit extension. After the expiration of the permit extension, the applicant
may apply for additional extensions as may be necessary to complete the
project. The fee for the first six-month extension shall be 50% of the original
building permit fee; the fee for a second six-month permit extension shall be
75% of the original building permit fee; and the fee for any subsequent six-
month extensions shall be 100% of the original building permit fee, as set
forth in the village's Comprehensive Fee and Fine Schedule. The applicant will
be required to pay the full fee for the permit extension prior to the issuance
of the six-month permit extension, regardless of the scope of work remaining to
be completed. However, if the work authorized by the permit extension is
completed prior to six months after the issuance of the permit extension, the
village will refund a portion of the permit extension fee to the applicant in
an amount prorated by the number of full months remaining in the permit
extension (e.g., if the work in completed in four and one-half months, one
sixth of the fee will be returned to the applicant). If the applicant fails to
timely apply for an additional extension, the original permit shall be deemed
to have expired, and any subsequent requests to extend the permit time shall be
treated as applications for a new building permit, which permit shall be
granted upon payment of new building permit fees in the amount prescribed in §
9-15 of this code for an original permit; provided, however, that if any code
requirements have changed since the issuance of the original permit affecting
portions of the work that has not yet been constructed and inspected, then the
plans and construction documents for the work shall be modified to comply with
such changed code requirements.
   (c)   In the event that the erection, construction, alteration, repair,
removal or the excavation of any building or structure allowed by a building
permit or permit extension issued by the code official pursuant to this section
is temporarily halted, delayed or substantially impaired as a result of
circumstances that were (1) outside of the applicant’s control, and (2) not
reasonably foreseeable with the exercise of due diligence and professional
judgment meeting the standards of the building trades industry (referred to
hereafter as “uncontrollable circumstances”), the applicant may petition the
code official for a permit tolling extension. Uncontrollable circumstances
warranting the issuance of a permit tolling extension include, but are not
limited to, strikes or labor disputes (other than those caused by the unlawful
acts of the applicant, its partners, or affiliated entities), the default,
dissolution, or bankruptcy of the general contractor, extraordinary weather
conditions, or other similar acts of God.
   (d)   The applicant shall be required to deliver evidence that the applicant
has prosecuted construction of the permitted work with diligence, and shall
provide evidence of causes of uncontrollable circumstances that have prevented
the work from being completed within the original permit or permit extension
period. If the code official determines that the applicant has prosecuted work
with diligence, or that the applicant’s inability to complete the work within
the original permit or permit extension period was due to uncontrollable
circumstances, the code official may, at his sole and absolute discretion,
authorize a permit tolling extension to extend the term of the original permit
or permit extension for a period of time equal to the duration the
uncontrollable circumstance persisted, or such lesser period that the code
official determines to be appropriate. Permit tolling extensions may be granted
retroactively on the condition that the applicant must apply for the permit
tolling extension as soon as is reasonably possible after the uncontrollable
circumstances have abated or subsided.

§ 9-11 WAIVED FOR ORDINARY REPAIRS.
   A permit will not be required for ordinary repair work, incidental to the
upkeep of a building or structure; provided, that there is not contemplated or
involved any change in the classification or any increase in the fire hazard
thereof; nor the removal of any beam or support; nor the renewal of any
external or division wall or portion thereof; nor the installing, closing or
changing of any stairs, exits, scuttles, skylights or fire escapes, nor
changing the number, location or connections of the fixtures, traps, vents,

granted. All such plans and drawings shall be drawn to a scale of not less than
one-eight of an inch to the foot, on paper or cloth, in ink, or by some process
that will not fade or be obliterated. All distances and dimensions shall be

provided, that such buildings are to be occupied and used by the owner as a
permanent residence, or accessory thereto; and provided further, that plans for
not more than one single-family dwelling or private garage shall be so excepted
during a period of one year from date of permit, for any one owner.
      (3)   True copies of such plans as may be required, in the opinion of the
director of public works, to illustrate the features of construction and
equipment of the building referred to, shall be filed with the director of
public works, and shall remain on file in his or her office for a period of six
months after the occupation of such building, after which such plans shall be
returned by the director of public works to the person by whom they have been
deposited with him or her, upon demand. It shall not be obligatory upon the
director of public works to retain such plans in his or her custody for more
than six months after the occupation of the building to which they relate.
      (4)   Complete plans and specifications of buildings for public or
business use for which permits are granted shall remain on file permanently in
the director of public works' office.
      (5)   In all cases, the approved plans, together with building permits,
shall be kept on the premises while the work is in progress.
   (c)   An application for a building permit shall further be accompanied by
an application for a certificate for occupancy and compliance and by a plat of
survey of the property prepared by a state registered land surveyor and
compliance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance shall be deemed
requisite before a building permit shall be granted.
   (d)   (1)   Application for a permit for the removal of a building or

authorized agent or architect, if granted the permit sought, will remove the
building or structure or part thereof in accordance with the description set
forth in the application and accompanying plans. The permit application shall
also contain a statement that the applicant is the legal owner of all of the
property and the building or structure scheduled to be removed as shown in the
application materials.
      (2)   The application shall be accompanied by duplicate sets of plans or
details for the demolition and removal of the building or structure, as well as

§ 9-13 ISSUANCE.
   (a)   When the application for a building permit has been made, and the
plans, specifications and plats in conformity with the provisions of this
article have been submitted, examined and approved, as provided for by this
article, the director of public works shall issue a permit, and shall file such
application, and shall apply to such plans and plans a final official stamp,
stating that the drawings to which the same has been applied comply with the
provisions of this chapter. One set of plans and plats so stamped shall be

prescribed therefor shall have been paid.
   (c)   The director of public works shall not sign or issue any permit
authorizing the construction, erection, repair, alteration or excavation for
any building or structure unless the plans submitted for the approval of the
director of public works clearly show that such building or structure with all
its appurtenances, foundations and attachments can be erected entirely within
the limits of the lot or tract of land upon which it is proposed to erect such
building or structure, in accordance with the zoning ordinance, except as
otherwise provided in this code; and no permit to erect, repair, alter or
excavate for any building or structure shall authorize the use of any part of
any public highway or other public ground for the construction or maintenance
of such building or structure, except as otherwise provided in this code; nor
shall any permit be issued for the construction or maintenance of any balcony
or canopy extending over any public highway, public street, public alley or
other public ground, unless specifically authorized by a resolution of the
president and board of trustees. No building permit for the construction of a
new principal building, or for the construction of an accessory building or
structure, addition or residential recreational facility, shall be issued
unless the provisions of
chapter 34, article III (Tree Preservation) are satisfied.
(Ord. N0. 2000-10-2092)
   (d)   (1)   No building permit for removal of any principal building or
structure shall be issued earlier than 60 days after the village has received a
completed application therefor; provided, however, that no building permit for
removal of any principal building or structure that has been designated by
village ordinance pursuant to
chapter 26A of this code as:
         A.   A landmark; or
         B.   Within a historic district shall be issued earlier than 180 days
after the village has received a completed application for such removal.

         A.   A building permit has been issued for the replacement principal
building or structure; or
         B.   In the absence of such permit, site restoration plans have been
approved by the director of public works or the director's designee
establishing that the lot will be adequately graded, landscaped and buffered
to:
            1.   Avoid runoff, siltation, erosion and related drainage
problems; and

other codes, ordinances, policies and practices of the village.
      (5)   In addition, any site restoration plan shall be subject to such
conditions necessary to ensure that the site restoration plans are timely
implemented and the conditions thereby established are maintained.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such building permit may be issued earlier than
herein prescribed if the director of public works determines that the building
or structure is in an unsafe, uninhabitable, dangerous or unhealthful condition
or that emergency conditions otherwise warrant such earlier issuance.

   Where in the judgment of the director of public works it is justified, the
director of public works may authorize building operations to commence and
proceed for such limited time, not exceeding ten days, as the director of
public works may deem and fix as sufficient to allow the owner, his or her
architect or agent to complete the filing of detailed plans and other data
required for the issuance of the final permit. The applicant for a temporary
permit shall furnish the director of public works with sufficient plans and
data to enable the director of public works to determine that the work be
commenced, and proposed subsequently to be done, is of a lawful nature.
Temporary permits shall be revocable at the will of the director of public
works.
§ 9-15 FEES AND CHARGES.
   (a)   Fees and charges for permits and inspection services required by this
Chapter shall be as set forth in the Comprehensive Fee and Fine Schedule. The
term "basement area", when used in the Comprehensive Fee and Fine Schedule,
shall mean those portions of a basement consisting of habitable space (as
defined by the International Building Code as adopted pursuant to § 9-18 of
this Code), and related bathrooms, toilet, closets, halls and storage areas,
but shall not include areas of a basement such as utility spaces and similar
areas in which the walls and ceiling are not finished with drywall or similar
building material.
   (b)   In addition to the permit fees noted in this section, there shall be
paid such charges for water used in connection with building operations as are
fixed by the scheduled water rates now in force or as the same may be amended
from time to time by the village president and board of trustees.
   (c)   All fees shall be paid to the village before issuance of any permits
provided for by this article and no fees are refundable.
   (d)   All work being done on public property shall require that a cash
deposit be posted in an amount the director of public works deems adequate to
restore that property and its improvements to its original condition.
   (e)   Permits for construction, alteration or improvements listed in
subsection
9-15(a), (b) or (c) above, except for permits for the erection or construction
of any new dwelling, will not be issued until permit applicant has provided an
accurate estimate, appraisal or other instrument describing the value that
would result from the construction, alteration or improvement, which estimate,
appraisal or instrument shall be acceptable to the director of public works.
The director of public works may establish, from time to time, minimum amounts
or rates upon which any estimate, appraisal or instrument shall be formulated.
Upon completion of the work authorized under the building permit, and prior to
the issuance of a certificate for occupancy, the director of public works may
require the permit applicant to deliver to the director of public works
verifiable evidence of the actual value relating to the construction,
alteration or improvement for which the permit was issued. To the extent that
the actual value is more than the estimated value reported at the time of the
application (or any application or notice regarding revisions to the permit
activities), the permit applicant shall be required to pay an additional permit
fee in an amount that reflects the actual final value; provided, however, in
the event that the actual value exceeds the estimated value reported for permit
application purposes by more than 25%, then an additional charge of 10% to the
final permit amount, as adjusted, shall be imposed. To the extent that the
final value is less than the estimated value reported for permit application
purposes, the building permit fee shall be adjusted and a refund will be
issued.

   (f)   Eleemosynary institutions applying for permits for construction or
improvements listed in subsection
9-15(a), (b) or (c) above shall be charged a fee of .25% of the value of the
new construction, improvement, installation or alteration. In no event shall
such fee be less than $50.
(Ord. No. 94-13-1949)
   (g)   When deemed appropriate by the department of public works/community
development, an application for exterior appearance review for a development in
the R-D, B-1 and B-2 zoning districts filed pursuant to §
7-503 of the zoning code shall be accompanied by an additional amount for
recoverable costs as provided in subsection
9-15(m)(1) below, as determined by the department of public works/community
development, to be deposited in an application fee escrow.
(Ord. No. 04-09-3098)
      (1)   The costs incurred by the village in processing an application
shall be deemed to consist of at least the following items of direct and
indirect expense:
         A.   Legal publication (direct cost);
         B.   Recording secretarial services (direct cost);
         C.   Court reporter (direct cost);
         D.   Document preparation and review (hourly staff salary times a
multiplier to be established from time to time by administrative order of the
village manager at a level sufficient to recover 100% of the direct and
indirect cost of such service);
         E.   Consultant fees and expenses (engineering, legal, planning, etc.)
(direct cost);
         F.   Copy reproduction (direct cost);
         G.   Document recordation (direct cost); and
         H.   Inspection and review fees (direct cost).
      (2)   From the date of the filing of any application pursuant to this
code, the village shall maintain an accurate record of the recoverable costs as
herein above defined, incurred in the processing of such application. If the
project is withdrawn at any time before the building permit is issued, the
village manager shall draw funds from the escrow account established for such
application to pay such costs and shall transfer such funds to the appropriate
village accounts. The village manager shall maintain an accurate record of all
such drawings.
      (3)   Should the village manager at any time determine that the escrow
account established in connection with any application is, or is likely to
become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of processing such application,
the village manager shall inform the applicant of that fact and demand an
additional deposit in an amounted deemed by the department of public works/
community development to be sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs.
Unless and until such additional amount is deposited by the applicant, the
village manager may direct that processing of the application shall be
suspended or terminated.
      (4)   As soon as reasonably feasible following the issuance of a building
permit, the village manager shall return the escrow deposit to the applicant.
      (5)   In the event that the project is withdrawn at any time before the
building permit is issued and the amount in the escrow is insufficient to pay
the total actual costs, a written demand for payment of the balance due shall
be mailed to the owner and the applicant. If unused balance remains in the
escrow account after paying the total actual costs, it shall be returned to the
applicant.
      (6)   The owner of the property subject of the application and, if
different, the applicant shall jointly and severally be liable for the payment
of the fee. By signing the application (either directly or through an agent),
the owner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay such fee and to consent to the
filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to ensure collection
of any such fee, plus the costs of collection, in the event such fee has not
been properly paid as required with the filing of the application. Any lien
filed pursuant to this subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by
statute for mortgages or mechanics’ liens.

   (j)   For any permit application submitted pursuant to this §
9-15 in connection with a multiple family dwelling or non-residential
structure, to the extent that the village manager or the manager’s designee
determines that third-party consultant services are required to review, process
or inspect such multiple family dwelling or non-residential structure, an
additional building permit fee shall be imposed, which additional building
permit fee shall be in the amount of the direct costs incurred by the village
for such third-party consultant services.

§ 9-16 PERMIT RENEWAL PROHIBITED; RESTORATION OF WORK.
   (a)   Any building permit or permit extension issued pursuant to this
article that has expired by the terms of §
9-10 hereof shall be deemed void and a nullity and shall not be renewed. Work
authorized under any such expired permit shall not be commenced except upon the
filing of a new application, payment of a new fee and issuance of a new permit,
all in accordance with the provisions of this chapter as they shall exist at
the time such new application is filed.
   (b)   Unless a new permit is issued as provided in subsection (a) of this
section, any work commenced pursuant to a permit that has expired by the terms
of §
9-10 hereof, and the property on which such work is located, shall be restored
to a safe, secure, sanitary and nuisance-free condition by the owner
immediately upon such permit expiration.

   It shall be unlawful to alter or in any way modify plans that have been
stamped as approved by the director of public works, as provided by this
article. If, during the progress of such work, it is desired to deviate, in any
manner affecting the construction or other essentials of the building, from the
terms of the application, or drawing, notice of such intention to alter or
deviate shall be given to the director of public works, and his or her written
assent shall first be obtained before such alteration or deviation may be made;
but alterations in buildings which do not involve any change in their
structural parts or of their stairways, elevators, fire escapes or other means
of communication or ingress or egress, or in lighting or ventilation or in
plumbing or electric wiring, and that are not in violation of any of the

ARTICLE XII. STORM WATER RUNOFF RESTRICTIONS
(Ord. No. 2007-19-3196)
§ 9-82 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this article XII is to preserve the landscaped character of
the village, promote effective storm water management, and avoid
overdevelopment on single-family residential lots. This article XII applies
only to lots in the single-family residential districts of the village, as
defined in the Glencoe zoning code.
§ 9-83 REGULATION.
   (a)   No adverse impact. No single-family development of a lot shall be
permitted that materially and adversely impacts storm water runoff or drainage
on:
      (1)   The subject property or other properties; or
      (2)   On any storm water facility or system, as determined by the
director of public works or designee, in his or her discretion, consistent with
this article XII and customary engineering practices and the village's
Engineering and Specifications Manual.
   (b)   Determination of compliance.
      (1)   A.   In furtherance of the director of public work's or designee's
determination pursuant to subsection
9-83(a), an applicant for single-family development of a lot shall submit
detailed storm water plans and other engineering documentation, including
without limitation a calculation of the C-Factor for the lot as proposed to be
developed. For purposes of this subsection
9-83(b), C-FACTOR is calculated using the following formula:
   (.95 X Impervious Surface on a Lot) + (.5 X Pervious Surface on a Lot)
               Total Lot Area
         B.   The determination of whether a particular surface is pervious or
impervious (or the degree to which a surface may be calculated as pervious)
shall be in the director of public work's or designee's discretion, consistent
with customary engineering practices and the village's Engineering and
Specifications Manual.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection
9-83(b)(4), the director of public works or designee shall conclude that a
proposed development complies with the general regulation set forth in
subsection
9-83(a) if such development does not exceed the greater of the following
subsections
9-83(b)(2)A. and B.:
         A.   The C-Factor set forth in the following table:
 
Lot Area                                                               C-Factor
i.   Lots equal to or less than 10,000 sq. ft                       .67
ii.   Lots greater than 10,000 sq. ft. but not more than 20,000 sq. .65
ft.
iii.   Lots greater than 20,000 sq. ft.                             .62
 
            or
         B.   The C-Factor existing on a lot that is developed with a single-
family dwelling as of the effective date of this article XII of
chapter 9, being August 16, 2007; provided, however, that this subsection
9-83(b)(2)B. shall not apply if the single-family dwelling is demolished,
damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50% of the cost
of replacement.
      (3)   If the director determines that a lot does not meet the general
regulation set forth in subsection
9-83(A) or the C-Factor standards set forth in subsection
9-83(b)(2), the owner may only proceed with the development of the lot if the
owner installs and maintains an alternative engineered solution that is
acceptable to the director of public works or designee, in his or her
discretion and consistent with the following:
         A.   The proposed alternative engineered solution shall be designed to
provide storm water detention for the lot in a manner that is equivalent to, or
results in a lower offsite storm water impact than, the applicable C-Factor for
the lot pursuant to subsection
9-83(b)(2)A. or B.;
         B.   Any proposed alternative engineered solution shall be designed
consistent with customary engineering standards for storm water drainage and
shall comply with the standards for acceptable alternative engineered
solutions, as set forth in the village's Engineering and Specifications Manual.
In addition, the alternative engineered solution shall be consistent with all
village codes, ordinances, regulations and policies, including without
limitation the purposes of the village's comprehensive plan, the village's tree
preservation ordinance contained in article II of
chapter 34 of this code, and the village's grading regulations contained in
article XIV of this
chapter 9; and
         C.   The alternative engineered solution shall be designed,
constructed and maintained at all times in a safe condition to protect persons
and property from injury and damage.
      (4)   If the director determines that exceptional circumstances exist on
or in connection with a lot, its development, or its environs that result or
will likely result in a material and adverse storm water runoff or drainage
effects notwithstanding the satisfaction of the C-Factor standards set forth in
subsection
9-83(b)(2), then the owner of such lot may be required to install and maintain
an alternative engineered solution in connection with the development of such
lot. The nature and extent of such alternative engineered solution shall be
determined by the director in the manner provided in subsection
9-83(b)(3).
      (5)   Prior to any certificate of occupancy being issued for a lot for
which an alternative engineered solution has been required pursuant to
subsection
9-83(b)(3) or subsection
9-83(b)(4), the owner shall execute and record a declaration of covenants and
restrictions to ensure maintenance and preservation of such alternative
engineered solution, which declaration shall be subject to the review and
approval of the village attorney. The declaration shall provide that the
ownership and maintenance of the alternative engineered solution shall be the
responsibility of the owner. The declaration shall further provide the village
with the right, but not the obligation, to inspect and, if necessary, repair,
replace, maintain, or otherwise care for the alternative engineered solution,
and the village shall have the right to assess its costs in connection with any
such actions against the owner of the lot.

and obtain a letter of map revision therefrom for the purpose of removing the
site from the floodplain. See §
9-101 for additional requirements.
   (h)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space that will be occupied by the authorized
fill or structure below the base flood elevation shall be compensated for and
balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below
the base flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one
and one-half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below
the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-
year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.

      (16)   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by drawings
of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and existing
ground elevations and all changes in grade resulting from any proposed
excavation or filling, and floodplain and floodway limits, sealed by a
registered land surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and
additions to buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of §
9-101.
   (d)   Other permit requirements. The applicant shall provide to the building
commissioner and to the village engineer copies of all other federal, state and
local permits and approvals that are required for this type of activity. The
building commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant all
other federal, state and local permits and approvals that are required for this
type of activity. The building commissioner shall not issue the development
permit unless all required federal, state and local permits have been obtained.
   (e)   Review of floodplain administrator. The floodplain administrator shall
review and approve applications submitted under this §
9-99.
   (f)   Preventing increased damages; appropriates uses. The only development
in a regulatory floodway that shall be allowed are appropriate uses, which
shall not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which shall not create
a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be
a threat to the public health, safety or welfare. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 92 Ill. Admin. Code § 708.70 shall be allowed. Appropriate uses do
not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, fencing, landscaping or planting designed to
act as a fence, and storage of material except as specifically defined above as
an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of or requiring access
to the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treating facilities, and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping, and other functionally water dependent uses;
      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities;
      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from anyone
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that will not block
flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds or other non-habitable accessory
structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block
flood flows, nor reduce regulatory floodway storage;
      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modifications thereto;
      (8)   Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of flooding
at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot, and aircraft
parking aprons built at or below ground elevation);
      (9)   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slope toward a watercourse;
      (10)   Flood proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures, including without limitation the construction of water tight window
wells, elevating structures or floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures, when the outside toe of the floodwall is no
more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure and
which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
      (11)   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or
repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50% of the market value
of the building before it was damaged or replaced and do not increase the
outside dimensions of the building;
      (12)   Additions to existing buildings above the base flood elevation
that do not increase a building’s footprint and are valued at less than 50% of
the market value of the building; and
      (13)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of
any new buildings, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
   (g)   Engineering and mitigation criteria. Within the regulatory floodway as
identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by OWR, the construction
of an appropriate use will be considered permissible provided that the proposed
project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so
stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered
professional engineer, and provided further that any structure meets the
protection requirements of §
9-101.
      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance so as not to increase flood stages
upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-
stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost
shall be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the
following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         A.   Regulatory floodway conveyance.
   "K" = 1.486 AR 2/3
       n
            where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area
of the cross-section and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.
         B.   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
         C.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of
effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length;
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length;
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used;
            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway
delineation on adjacent properties; and
            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      (2)   Preservation of regulatory floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be at least equal to one and
one-half times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created
storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be
required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be
placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year
flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-
year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood
elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All excavations described in this subsection
9-99(g)(2) shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, then the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to OWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. There shall be no reduction
in regulatory floodway surface area as a result of a regulatory floodway
modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at
existing structures.
      (3)   Preservation of regulatory floodway velocities so as not to
increase stream erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except
bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work shall not result
in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or
stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood
event. In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the
purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows,
velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
flood event; or the upstream flood stage increases shall be contained within
the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase
upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot, then the developer must
contact OWR, Dam Safety Section, for a dam safety permit or waiver.
         A.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages shall be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
9-97. Culverts must be analyzed using the United States Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration Hydraulic Chart for the
Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the United States
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of
Bridge Waterways calculation procedures.
         B.   Lost regulatory floodway storage must be compensated pursuant to
the requirements of subsection
9-99(g)(2).
         C.   Velocity increases must be mitigated pursuant to the requirements
of subsection
9-99(g)(3).
         D.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an Illinois Department of Transportation
permit must be received.
         E.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to OWR for concurrence that a conditional letter of map revision from
FEMA is not required by this subsection
9-99(g).
         F.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed pursuant to the requirements of subsection
9-99(g)(8).
      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and
approach roads.
         A.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than a one-tenth foot increase
in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to
and including the 100-year frequency flood event, if the existing structure is
not a source of flood damage.
         B.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
then the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         C.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a
source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance
with 17 Ill. Admin. Code §§ 3708 et seq. and submitted to the OWR for review
and concurrence before a permit is issued.
      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. Any
increase in upstream flood stages over existing conditions for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency flood event shall be contained
within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel
banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood
walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or permit-not-required
letter must be obtained from OWR, Dam Safety Section, for a dam safety permit
or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures defined
in §
9-95 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Admin. Code §§ 3708 et
seq.
      (7)   Flood proofing of existing habitable residential and commercial
structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the flood proofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for flood
proofing activities.
      (8)   Excavation in the regulatory floodway. When excavation is proposed
in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including without limitation the
modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures or
to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition
sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
         A.   When water is flowing from a narrower section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every four feet of the flood stream's length;
         B.   When water is flowing from a wider section to a narrower section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length;
         C.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used; and
         D.   Erosion and scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
      (9)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
regulatory floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the
applicant.
      (10)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this §
9-99 shall be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to OWR through
hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project shall not
singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the
project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the
100-year frequency event.
      (11)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         A.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory
floodway study referenced in §
9-97 must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, OWR shall be contacted for
approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
         B.   If the base flood elevation at the site of the proposed
construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a
larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the
requirements of this §
9-99 for the base flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and
conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         C.   If the applicant learns from OWR, local governments, or a private
owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be
removed, reconstructed or modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this §
9-99 for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions
when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.
   (h)   Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to OWR and to FEMA all
the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from OWR a conditional
approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued; provided,
however, that the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by OWR
until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and
OWR. In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated
areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed
conditional regulatory floodway map revision before OWR approval can be given.
No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a
conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take
place until a final letter of map revision is issued by FEMA and OWR.
   (i)   Professional engineer supervision. All engineering analyses shall be
performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
   (j)   Construction activity. After receipt of conditional approval of the
regulatory floodway map change and issuance of a permit and a conditional
letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory
floodway designation may proceed; provided, however, that no buildings or
structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed
in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of
map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map shall be revised upon
acceptance and concurrence by OWR and FEMA of the as-built plans.
   (k)   State review. For those projects listed below located in a regulatory
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to OWR for their review and
concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
      (1)   OWR shall review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to
a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection
9-99(g)(4);
      (2)   OWR shall review an engineer's determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection
9-99(g)(5);
      (3)   OWR shall review alternative transition sections and hydraulically
equivalent storage pursuant to subsections
9-99(g)(1),
9-99(g)(2) and
9-99(g)(8); and
      (4)   OWR shall review and approve prior to the start of construction any
Illinois Department of Transportation projects, dams and all other federal,
state or local units of government projects, including projects of the village.
   (l)   Other permits. In addition to the requirements of this article XIV, a
development permit for a site located in a regulatory floodway shall not be
issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation
that a permit is not required, from OWR, issued pursuant to the Act. No permit
from OWR shall be required if OWR has delegated this responsibility to the
village.
   (m)   Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a dam defined in §
9-95 shall obtain a OWR dam safety permit pursuant to 17 Ill. Admin. Code §§
3702 et seq. prior to the start of such construction, modification or removal.
If the building commissioner finds a dam that does not have a OWR permit, the
building commissioner shall immediately notify the Dam Safety Section of OWR.
If the building commissioner finds a dam that is believed to be in an unsafe
condition, the building commissioner shall immediately notify the owner of the
dam, if known, OWR, the Dam Safety Section in Springfield, Illinois and the
Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).
   (n)   Activities that do not require a registered professional engineer's
review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review; provided, however, that such activities shall
meet the other requirements of this article XIV, including the mitigation
requirements.
      (1)   Underground and overhead utilities:
         A.   That do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations;
         B.   That do not require the placement of aboveground structures in
the regulatory floodway;
         C.   When, in the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream
bed; and
         D.   When, in the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are

(Ord. No. 2021-16-3512)
§ 9-100 OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHA AREAS WHERE REGULATORY FLOODWAYS ARE NOT
IDENTIFIED.
   (a)   Permitted development. In SFHAs or floodplains where no regulatory
floodways have been identified and no base flood elevations have been
established by FEMA, and including SFHAs or floodplains that drain more than
one square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect
of the development proposal, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the
flow and passage of floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood
elevation.
   (b)   Development permit. No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by state law shall commence any development in a SFHA or
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit therefor from the
building commissioner.
   (c)   Application. Application for a development permit shall be made on a
form provided by the building commissioner. The applicant shall submit a
completed application to the building commissioner and forward a copy of such
application to the village engineer. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions,
existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation of
the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the
requirements of §
9-101. The building commissioner shall determine, and the applicant shall
submit, an appropriate application fee, taking into account the village
engineer's cost of review and other village expenses incurred in issuing the
development permit. The application shall also include the following
information:
      (1)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose and
intended use;
      (2)   Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn
to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to
be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
      (3)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity;
      (4)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a
minimum:
         A.   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale and north arrow;
         B.   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing
existing and proposed conditions, including without limitation principal
dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in NAVD 88, adjacent property
lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between
proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is
near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and
orientation of cross-sections, north arrow and a graphical or numerical scale;
and
         C.   Cross-section views of the project and engineering study reach
showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water
elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood
elevation and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical);
      (5)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted
showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of this §
9-100; and
      (6)   Any and all other federal, state and local permits or approvals
that may be required for this type of development.
   (d)   Comparison of elevations. Based on the best available existing data
according to the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information
Repository, the village engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the
base flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the
developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation pursuant to the requirements
of §
9-97(f). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher
than the base flood elevation as of the site's first FIRM identification is not
in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article
XIV. The village engineer shall forward to the building commissioner
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first FIRM identification.
   (e)   Other permit requirements. The applicant shall provide to the building
commissioner and to the village engineer copies of all other federal, state and
local permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that are required for
this type of activity. The building commissioner shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant all other federal, state and local permits,
approvals or permit-not-required letters that are required for this type of
activity. The building commissioner shall not issue a development permit unless
all other federal, state and local permits have been obtained.
   (f)   No public health threat. No development in the SFHA, when a regulatory
floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or otherwise threaten the public
health, safety or welfare.
   (g)   Standards. Within all riverine SFHAs, when the regulatory floodway has
not been determined, the following standards shall apply.
      (1)   Calculation of regulatory floodway. The developer shall have a
registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting
plans, calculations and data that the project meets the engineering
requirements of §§
9-99(g)(1) through
9-99(g)(10) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provisions of §§
9-97(e) and (f). As an alternative, the developer may have an engineering study
performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to OWR for
acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of such regulatory
floodway by OWR, the developer then shall demonstrate that the project meets
the requirements of §
9-99 for the regulatory floodway as defined in §
9-95.
      (2)   OWR permit. No building permit shall be issued unless the applicant
first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required,
from OWR; provided, however, that no permit from OWR shall be required if OWR
has delegated permit responsibility to the village pursuant to 17 Ill. Admin.
Code § 3708 for regulatory floodways, pursuant to OWR’s statewide permit
entitled “Construction in Floodplains with No Designated Floodways in
Northeastern Illinois.”
      (3)   Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction,
modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as
defined in §
9-95 shall obtain a OWR dam safety permit or as defined in §
9-95 a permit-not-required letter prior to the start of such construction,
modification or removal. If the building commissioner finds a dam that does not
have a OWR permit, the building commissioner shall immediately notify the Dam
Safety Section of OWR. If the building commissioner finds a dam that is
believed to be in an unsafe condition, the building commissioner shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam, if known, OWR, the Dam Safety Section
of OWR and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).
      (4)   No review required. The following activities may be permitted
without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base
flood elevation and regulatory floodway; provided, however, that such
activities shall meet the other requirements of this article XIV:
         A.   Underground and overhead utilities:
            1.   That do not result in any increase in existing ground
elevations;
            2.   That do not require the placement of aboveground structures in
the floodway;
            3.   When, in the case of underground stream crossings, the top of
the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing
stream bed; and
            4.   When, in the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers
are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to
catch debris.
         B.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
            1.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope;
            2.   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
            3.   Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the
outfall location.
         C.   Construction of shoreline and streambed protection:
            1.   That does not exceed 1,000 feet in length or two cubic yards
per lineal foot of stream bed;
            2.   When materials are not placed higher than the existing top of
bank; or
            3.   When materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-
sectional area of the stream channel by more than 10%.
         D.   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            1.   The approach roads will be one-half foot or less above natural
grade;
            2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert;
            3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least
two feet below the top of the lowest bank;
            4.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction; and
            5.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
one year after authorization.
         E.   The construction of light poles, sign posts and similar
structures;
         F.   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields

floodplains when no regulatory floodways have been identified (Zones A, AO, AH,
AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-V30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements shall
be met.
   (a)   Public health standards.
      (1)   No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants or other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood
protection elevation.
      (2)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer
lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted, provided that all
manholes or other aboveground openings located below the flood protection
elevation are water tight.
      (3)   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (4)   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (5)   All other activities, defined as development, such as pools,
fences, filling, paving, etc., shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows
or increase potential flood damages, nonstructural fill within a coastal high
hazard area (zone V, V1-30, or VE) or within a moderate wave action area shall
be permitted only if an engineering report demonstrates that the fill will not
cause wave runup, ramping, or deflection of floodwaters that cause damage to
buildings.
      (6)   The use of fill for structural support of buildings within a
coastal high hazard area (zone V, V1-30, or VE) or within a moderate wave
action area is prohibited.
      (7)   Man-made alterations of sand dunes within a coastal high hazard
area (zone V, V1-30, or VE) or within a moderate wave action area are
prohibited unless an engineering report documents that the alterations will not
increase potential flood damage by reducing the wave and flow dissipation
characteristics of the sand dunes.
      (8)   Within a coastal high hazard area or within a moderate wave action
area, bulkheads, seawalls, revetments, and other erosion control structures
shall not be connected to the foundation or superstructure of a building, and
shall be designed and constructed so as not to direct floodwaters or increase
flood forces or erosion impacts on the foundation or superstructure of any
building.
   (b)   Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving channel
modification, fill or stream maintenance (including without limitation levees),
the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In
addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing within 30
days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the
watercourse.
   (c)   Protecting buildings.
      (1)   All buildings located within zones A, AO, AH, and AE shall be

XIV.
§ 9-103 VARIATIONS.
   (a)   Authorization. No variations shall be granted to any development
located in a designated floodway as defined in §
9-95. When a development proposal is located outside of a designated floodway,
and whenever the standards of this article place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board of appeals
for a variation. The zoning board of appeals shall review the applicant’s
request for a variation and shall submit its recommendation to the board of
trustees, which may grant the variation by ordinance duly adopted. The village
board of trustees may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it
deems necessary to further the flood protection intent of this article XVI.
   (b)   Standards. No variation shall be granted by the village board of
trustees unless the applicant demonstrates, and the zoning board of appeals
finds, that all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief;

pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP;
      (9)   The granting of the variation will not alter the essential
character of the area involved, including existing stream uses; and
      (10)   All other required state and federal permits or waivers have been
obtained.
   (c)   Notice to applicant. The building commissioner shall notify an
applicant in writing that a variation from the requirements of §
9-101 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building shall:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant shall acknowledge in writing that the applicant assumes
the risk and liability.
   (d)   The findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the zoning board
of appeals and the board of trustees according to §
9-103(b), the notifications required by §
9-103(c), and a record of hearings and evidence considered as justification for
the issuance of all variances from this article XIV shall be maintained by the
village in perpetuity.
   (e)   Historic structures. Variations requested in connection with
restoration of a site or building listed on the National Register of Historical
Places or documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic
Preservation Agency may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of subsections
9-103(a) and
9-103(b), subject to conditions that:
      (1)   The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the building; and
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's
continued designation as a historic structure.
(Ord. No. 2021-16-3512)
§ 9-104 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this article XIV is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This
article XIV does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the
SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This article XIV does not create
liability on the part of the village or any official, officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article XIV or
any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
§ 9-105 PENALTY.
   (a)   Violations. Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit for
development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the requirements of a
permit or conditions of a variation resolution shall be deemed to be a
violation of this article XIV. Upon due investigation, the building
commissioner may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
article XIV exist. The building commissioner shall issue a notice of violation.
The notice of violation constitutes a suspension of the permit.
   (b)   Notice of violation. The notice of violation shall contain the address
or parcel identification number of the property, a brief description of the
violation; section of this article XIV violated; the requirement to stop all
work in violation of this article XIV, a statement informing the violator that
they may contest the notice in writing within ten days, correct the violation
in ten days, or apply for a permit; a warning that if the violator fails to
comply the village shall institute appropriate legal proceedings; and a
statement that article XIV authorizes fines of not less than $50 nor more than
$750 for each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (1)   Notification to the owner shall be in any of the following manners:
         A.   By personally delivering to the owner of the property involved;
or to the owner's agent, or to the person doing the work;
         B.   By posting a copy of the stop work order on the subject property
in a conspicuous place;
         C.   By personally delivering or mailing a copy of the notice of
violation to any adult who resides at, occupies, uses, leases, manages, or
maintains the property on which the violation is located; or
         D.   By personally delivering or mailing a copy of the notice of
violation to any owner in title to the property on which the violation is
located.
   (c)   Redress. If such owner fails after ten days’ written notice to correct
the violation, the village may make application to the Illinois Circuit Court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this article XIV or such other
order as the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this article XIV.
Any person who violates this article XIV shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined not less than $25 nor more than $750 for each offense. A separate offense
shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs
or continues. The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
(Ord. No. 2014-05-3357)
   (d)   Willful act. The building commissioner shall inform the owner that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and,
therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
   (e)   Floodplain development permit suspension or revocation. No floodplain
development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is
held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall be
served on the permittee and shall state: (1) the grounds for complaint or
reasons for suspension or revocation: and (2) the time and place of the
hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the
zoning board of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended
or revoked.
   (f)   Other action. Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

ARTICLE XV. STEEP SLOPE REGULATIONS
§ 9-110 INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   The topography of the Village of Glencoe is characterized by an
abundance of ravines and bluffs. These are valuable land resources that should
be protected. Bluffs and ravines play a central role in the management of storm
water throughout the village; they are also ecologically fragile and inherently
unstable. Their proper care and maintenance are important to avoid degradation
that could adversely affect the entire community.
   (b)   Steep slope areas may contain sediment, rock, and soils (1) that are
natural features subject to erosion, surface and subsurface movement of water,
and other destabilizing forces, and (2) whose stability is affected by the
quality and root structure of natural ground cover. Regulating proposed
development according to the natural characteristics of steep slope terrain,
such as degree of sloping, significant vegetation, soil stability, and existing
drainage patterns will allow for development on top of steep slope areas,
including bluffs and ravines, while minimizing the physical impact of such
development. The public interest will be served by protecting people and
property from the potentially hazardous geological and hydrological conditions
characteristic of ravine and bluff areas.
(Ord. No. 2013-13-3343)
§ 9-111 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   The purpose of this article is to regulate development along or near
steep slope areas to protect slope stability and overall drainage and water
management in the village. The purpose of this article is not to regulate for
aesthetic or habitat preservation purposes; rather, the purpose is to prevent
erosion of ravines and bluffs by regulating and managing steep slopes for
purposes of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. This article
protects people and property from the potentially hazardous geological and
hydrological conditions characteristic of ravine and bluff areas and further
recognizes that maintenance of stable ecological relationships minimizes
environmental degradation of the land and Lake Michigan. Due to improper and
unnecessary development within these sensitive areas, conditions are created
that jeopardize life, property, and the natural ecosystem. It is the intent of
this Article to establish appropriate controls. All land use and development
on, within, and adjacent to the steep slope is controlled by this article.
While this article provides for the reasonable use of steep slope areas and
related lands, it does so while protecting the public health, safety, and
welfare by:
      (1)   Discouraging development that threatens the stability of steeply
sloped terrain.
      (2)   Encouraging appropriate engineering technology to result in stable
slopes during and subsequent to development;
      (3)   Encouraging building techniques that increase slope stability;
      (4)   Reducing uncontrolled storm water runoff, soil erosion, and mud
slides by minimizing grading, encouraging the preservation of trees and other
vegetation, and, where necessary, requiring revegetation;
      (5)   Permitting development that is compatible with the natural
characteristics of steep slope terrain, such as degree of sloping, soil
suitability, and existing natural and man-made drainage patterns;
      (6)   Preserving the ravine and bluff environment through the retention
of dominant steep slopes and ridges in their natural state; and
      (7)   Reducing the physical impact on steep slopes by encouraging
innovative site and architectural design, minimizing grading, and requiring
restoration of graded areas.
   (b)   Applicability: this article only applies to properties that include or
are adjacent to a bluff along Lake Michigan or a ravine.
(Ord. No. 2013-13-3343)

      (2)   The line representing the intersection of the table land (or if no
such intersection, the table land extended) of such lot with a 22 degree slope
(2.5H:1V ratio) extending upward from the toe of bluff or ravine. For any lot
that lacks table land, for the purpose identifying the slope impact area, the
Director shall utilize the horizontal projection of the street line of the lot
as the table land. In addition, the slope impact area also includes the area of
the lot where the slope of the lot is steeper than 5.7 degrees (10H:1V ratio).

outside the steep slope zone.
   STEEP SLOPE LINE. A line representing the intersection of the table land (or
if no such intersection exists, the table land extended) with a 27 degree slope
(2H: 1V) extended upward from the toe of a bluff or ravine. For any lot that
lacks table land, for the purpose identifying the steep slope line, the
Director shall utilize the horizontal projection of the street line of the lot
as the table land.
   STEEP SLOPE ZONE. That portion of the slope impact area of a lot that lies
between the steep slope line and the toe line.
   STREET LINE. The street line as defined in the zoning code.
   TABLE LAND. Land at the top of a bluff or ravine where the slope is less
than a 5.7 degree slope (10H:1V ratio)
   TOE OR TOE LINE OF BLUFF AND RAVINE. The toe of the ravine or bluff slope is
that point in the ravine or bluff where the slope is less than a 5.7 degree
slope (10H:1V) or where the slope reverses direction. On compound slopes where
there may be more than one possible toe location, the controlling point shall
be whichever toe that provides the greatest slope impact area. In plan view,
the toe of bluff or ravine is depicted as continuous line, and is referred to
as the toe line.

(Ord. No. 2013-13-3343)
§ 9-115 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Any application for development in the slope impact area shall be
reviewed by the Director, who will consider such application in light of the
standards of this section relating to landscape planning, soil mechanics
engineering, hydrology, geology, environmental design, and architecture. It is
recognized, however, that each slope impact area has unique characteristics and
encounters different dynamics affecting its stability and preservation. As a
result, the Director may determine for any application that certain of the
following standards may not apply in whole or in part to such application so
long as the Director determines that the application for development in its
totality satisfies the purposes of this article to a substantial degree without
creating an economic hardship as provided in §
9-119 of this article.
   (b)   The standards applicable to development in a slope impact area are as
follows:
      (1)   Safety control of steep slopes.
         A.   The development will not jeopardize slope stability on the
subject site or neighboring properties.
         B.   Except as necessary for an approved development, no filling,
grading, and earth moving shall be occur in a slope impact area.
         C.   Whenever there is construction upon any property that includes or
is adjacent to a steep slope zone, a fence will be erected temporarily along
the top edge of the steep slope zone, during any construction and/or demolition
activity upon such property.
      (2)   Construction techniques. All proposed structures shall have
foundations designed in a manner consistent with sound engineering and
geological principles. In addition, the following techniques shall be employed
to enhance stabilization of the ravine or bluff:
         A.   Planning the development to recognize and fit the natural
topography, soils, geology, hydrology, and other existing conditions on the
proposed sites;
         B.   Orienting development so that filling, grading, and earth moving,
landscaping and other site preparation is kept to an absolute minimum;
         C.   Preserving and enhancing the landscape through minimized
disruption of natural terrain and existing vegetation;
         D.   Minimizing disruption or alteration of natural drainage ways;
         E.   Minimizing the time during which areas are bare and exposed;
         F.   Designing and properly locating structures so that structure's
weight does not negatively impact slope stability; and
         G.   Considering the effect of undercutting at the base of a slope
impact area caused by wave action, storm water flow, erosion, and/or channel
changes.
      (3)   Hydrological controls.
         A.   Natural channels. Natural drainage ways shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible.
         B.   Controlled runoff. Concentrated runoff from impervious surfaces
shall be collected and transported in a pipe or other approved manner to a
municipal storm sewer system, if available.
         C.   Water discharge into steep slope. Whenever stormwater is
transported across a property for discharge into a sleep slope zone, the
conveyance pipes shall be of non-segmented (continuous sections of minimum 100
ft.) pipe material, which shall be installed below ground by directional boring
where possible.
         D.   Trenching. No pipe shall be installed within a steep slope zone
by excavating a trench unless such trench is approved by the Director of Public
Works.
         E.   Pipe materials. Flexible corrugated pipes shall not be used
within a slope impact area unless directional boring is found to be infeasible
in the sole determination of the Director.
         F.   Interceptor ditches. When required by the Director pursuant to
sound professional engineering principles, interceptor ditches shall be
established above steep slopes in order that soil shall not become saturated
and the intercepted water shall be conveyed in a pipe or other approved manner
to a municipal storm sewer system, if available, or to the bottom of ravine or
bluff slopes in a manner designed to prevent erosion.
         G.   Discharge point stabilization. Natural drainage ways shall be
stabilized by landscape integration and rip-rap or other means consistent with
sound professional engineering practice, to a distance below drainage and
culvert discharge points sufficient to convey the discharge without channel
erosion and in such a manner as to dissipate the energy of the discharge as
approved by the Director of Public Works.
         H.   Energy dissipater. All outflow from a stormwater conveyance pipe
must discharge into an energy dissipater.
         I.   Early completion. The overall drainage system shall be completed
and made operational at the earliest possible time during construction, the
schedule of which shall be approved by the Director of Public Works.
         J.   Impact on adjacent property. The natural or usual flow of surface
or subsurface water shall not be altered or obstructed in any way by grade
changes that may adversely affect the property of another by contributing
either to pooling or collection of waters or to the concentration or
intensification of surface water discharge. However, development which might
otherwise be prohibited hereinabove may be allowed if such waters are properly
drained by a pipe or other approved manner to a municipal storm sewer system,
if available, or to the bottom of ravine or bluff slopes. All grade changes
shall comply with
Chapter 9, Article XIII of the Village Code.
      (4)   Vegetation and revegetation.
         A.   Natural vegetation. Every effort shall be made to maintain
natural vegetation in the slope impact area.
         B.   Smallest area. At all times, the smallest practical area of raw
soil shall be exposed for as short a duration of time as practical. When
required by the Director pursuant to sound professional engineering principles,
temporary vegetation or other acceptable cover shall be used to protect areas
of raw soil exposed during development and to prevent airborne or waterborne
transportation of soil.
         C.   Revegetation. A mixed planting of perennial and woody species is
recommended for use in the slope impact areas disturbed by development.
         D.   Erosion control mat. Temporary erosion control matting properly
staked and trenched shall be provided over raw soil areas until new vegetation
is established.
      (5)   Filling, grading, and earth moving.
         A.   Minimum alterations. Filling, grading, and earth moving shall be
limited to the minimum required for building foundations, driveways, drainage
control structures, and immediate yard areas. With the exception of restoration
efforts, substantial filling, grading, and earth moving shall not be permitted
and is prohibited.
         B.   Erosion control. All filling, grading, and earth moving shall be
accomplished in a manner that will create the lowest possible potential for
airborne or waterborne transportation of soil.
         C.   Soil fill in steep slope zone. All fill in steep slope zone is
prohibited, other than back-fill which is determined by the Director of Public
Works to be necessary for slope stabilization.
         D.   Soil fill on table land. In conformance with generally accepted
engineering standards, all fill on table land shall be stabilized to at least
90% of maximum dry density as determined in ASTM procedure D-1557 or
equivalent.
         E.   Prompt completion. All filling, grading, and earth moving shall
be accomplished in the shortest practical period of time, the schedule of which
shall be approved by the Director of Public Works. All excavated material shall
be removed from the slope impact area and no temporary or permanent material
storage shall be permitted within the slope impact area. No existing natural
vegetation shall be destroyed, removed or disturbed prior to the initiation of
development activities.

9A-1   Purpose
   
9A-2   Definitions
   
9A-3   Requirement of valid alarm user permit
   
9A-4   Alarm system requirements
   
9A-5   Permit fees

9A-9   Revocation of alarm user permit
   
9A-10   Charges for failure to pay promptly
   
9A-11   Non-payment notice procedure
§ 9A-1 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the imposition of fees
to be charged to that portion of the village resident and business population
that maintains mechanically or electronically activated alarm systems, and to
reduce the number of unnecessary responses by the department of public safety
to such alarms.
   (b)   The inherent difficulties and malfunctions associated with such
mechanically or electronically activated alarm systems result in unnecessary or
non-bona fide alarm activation and consequently require unnecessary responses
by the department of public safety. Such unnecessary responses severely impact
and endanger the safety and welfare of the residents of the village. In
addition to the significant cost involved in responding to such alarms and the
concurrent loss of manpower and ineffective utilization of equipment, such
alarms require emergency responses that may contribute to a high accident rate.
   (c)   A system of graduated fees for public safety department responses to
alarms serves the dual purpose of encouraging the cessation of non-bona fide
alarms and of charging the cost of such alarms to that portion of the
population wishing to use them.
§ 9A-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM OCCURRENCE. The activation of an alarm system for, or as a result of,

         A.   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 200 mg/l;
and
         B.   A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/l.
      (2)   The volumetric portion of the basic user charge shall be computed
by multiplying the water and/or waste water usage per billing period by a waste
water user rate which is developed as follows:
         A.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the waste water facilities including replacement costs;
         B.   Estimate the projected annual billable water and/or waste water
volume from past meter reading records; and
         C.   Compute the user rate by dividing the annual operation,
maintenance and replacement costs by the annual billable water volume.
   (c)   Debt service charge. The debt service charge, if applicable, shall
consist of the average annual amount required to pay interest, principal and
coverage of revenue bonds or loans outstanding and shall be determined by:
      (1)   Dividing such average annual amount by the number of users
connected to the system and pro-rated to each user each quarterly billing
period;
      (2)   By dividing such average annual amount by the number of gallons
billed in the preceding year to determine a unit rate per 1,000 gallons; or
      (3)   By a combination of subsections
21A-61(c)(1) and (2) above to provide the required annual amount for debt
service.
   (d)   Surcharge. A surcharge, in addition to the above mentioned charges,
may be levied upon users by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago in accordance with its regulations and ordinances.
      (1)   The adequacy of the waste water service charge shall be reviewed
annually and shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service
or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs.
      (2)   The users of waste water treatment services will be notified
annually in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of
the user charges that are attributable operation, maintenance and replacement
of the system and that part attributable to debt service.

§ 21A-62 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   (a)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and
surcharges shall be either:
      (1)   Metered waste water volume read to the nearest increment of 1,000
gallons during each billing period; or
      (2)   Metered water consumption read to the nearest increment of 1,000
gallons during the most recent billing period.
(Ord. No. 08-04-3215; Ord. No. 2020-30-3496)
   (b)   If the person discharging sewage into the public sewers procures part
or all of his or her water from sources other than the public water system, the
person shall install and maintain at his or her expense water meters of a type
approved by the director of public works for the purpose of determining the
volume of water obtained from these other sources.
   (c)   Devices for measuring the volume of sewage discharged may be required
by the director of public works if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.
   (d)   Metering devices for determining the volumes of sewage shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person discharging such sewage.
Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless
service is cancelled, without the consent of the director of public works.
§ 21A-63 WASTE WATER SERVICE RATES AND CHARGES.
   There shall be and there are hereby established rates for the use of and
service supplied by the sewerage system of the Village of Glencoe as follows.
   (a)   Basic user rate (OM&R). A basic user rate (OM&R) which may consist of
both a fixed and volumetric consumption based component as set forth in the
village’s Comprehensive Fee and Fine Schedule is hereby established. The
minimum basic user rate of the Village of Glencoe to be billed during each
three-month period shall be set forth in the village’s Comprehensive Fee and
Fine Schedule.
(Ord. No. 2011-02-3283; Ord. No. 2016-04-3394; Ord. No. 2018-05-3436)
   (b)   Debt service charge. Reserved.
   (c)   Surcharge rates and charges. The rate of surcharge for BOD5 and
suspended solids shall be determined by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago, if applicable.
(Ord. No. 2011-02-3283; Ord. No. 2012-03-3304)
§ 21A-64 COMPUTATION OF WASTE WATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   The following is the procedure for calculating waste water service charges
for users located within the corporate limits.
(Ord. No. 92-2-1868; Ord. No. 96-20-2016; Ord. No. 2008-19-3230)
   (a)   Metered users. The waste water service charge for metered users shall
be computed using the following formula:
 
WC = V (OM&R) + DSC + V (DSR) + S
Where WC = Amount of waste water service charge in dollars per billing period
V        = The volume of flow expressed in thousand gallons as described in §
           21A-62(a)
(OM&R)   = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement costs in
           dollars per thousand gallons.
DSC      = Debt Service Charge for the fixed charge applicable to payment of
           debt service in dollars per billing period, if applicable
           Remaining debt service rate in dollars per billing period for the
           remainder of debt service cost (after deducting revenues received
DSR      = from the debt service charge), such remainder of debt service
           requirements will be divided by total billable flow to compute the
           rate per 1,000 gallons, if applicable
           Amount of waste water surcharge in dollars as computed by the
S        = Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, if
           applicable
 
   (b)   Non-metered users.
      (1)   All non-metered users of the waste water facilities within the
corporate limits shall pay a minimum flat rate charge as set forth in the
village’s Comprehensive Fee and Fine Schedule which shall allow the use of
10,000 gallons per quarter.
(Ord. No. 08-04-3215; Ord. No. 2016-04-3394)
      (2)   In the event use of the waste water facilities is determined by the
director of public works to be in excess of 10,000 gallons per quarter, the
director may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the
water supply or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied.
   (c)   Multiple unit users. Where more than one residential and/or commercial
unit is located on the same premises as the user or being served through the
same water meter or sewer connection as such user, there shall be imposed on
such user an additional debt service charge for each such additional unit
provided with sewer service and served by the single connection. The additional
debt service charge, if applicable, for each unit shall be added to the bill
computed in the manner as hereinabove set forth.
   (d)   Golf courses.
      (1)   Golf courses with separate meters for irrigation shall not be
considered a basic user of the village’s sewer service, and therefore, will not
be charged a waste water service charge.
      (2)   In the event the director of public works determines golf courses
are utilizing waste water service, the director may require installation of
metering devices on the water supply or sewer main to measure the amount of
service supplied or base usage on actual water consumption on that meter.

   (d)   (1)   Whenever a person, firm, corporation or entity occupying any
premises requests or obtains waste water service from the village there shall
be established a waste water account for such premises that shall remain in
effect unless and until a final waste water service bill is requested and paid,
and a certified receipt of final payment is issued from the village relating to
such account. Any person, firm, corporation or entity owning or occupying the
premises shall be responsible for all fees, charges, rates, penalties, fines,
obligations and liabilities relating to such account, whether such person,
firm, corporation or entity originally opened such account or assumed such
account upon the transfer of property ownership or occupancy and irrespective
of the usage of the waste water system by such person, firm, corporation or
entity; provided, however, that any person, firm, corporation or entity who is

following the issuance of a final bill for waste water services for such
premises, unless the village receives a request to establish a new waste water
account for such premises. If water service is terminated before any request
for a new waste water account is received, the applicable re-connection fee or
charge must be paid to the village before water service to such premises will
be re-activated. Unless the director of public works determines that a premises
is authorized to be served by a sewerage system other than the village's waste
water system, any request for a water account from the village will also be
deemed a request for a waste water account from the village.
(Ord. No. 2003-15-3085)
§ 21A-71 DELINQUENT BILLS; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   If the charges for such services are not paid within 30 days after the

the structure, building, object, or site since it obtained honorary landmark
status, the commission shall conduct a meeting with the applicant to review the
nature of any alterations and whether the alterations were consistent with the
criteria set forth in section
26A-53.
         (a)   If the commission determines that any alterations to the
structure, building, object, or site were consistent with the criteria set
forth in section
26A-53, then the commission shall recommend that the board of trustees adopt an
ordinance granting certified status to such structure, building, object, or
site. Upon adoption of such ordinance by the board of trustees, the structure,
building, object, or site shall thereafter be a certified landmark and shall be
subject to the requirements of this chapter. The board of trustees shall also
direct that the ordinance approving such certified status be recorded in the
office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, along with the declaration
executed by the owner(s) of record pursuant to section
26A-21(c)(1)(D)(4).
         (b)   If the commission determines that any alterations to the
structure, building, object, or site were not consistent with the criteria set
forth in section
26A-53, then the commission shall direct the applicant to file an application
for certified status pursuant to section
26A-21(c)(1)(A) or
26A-21(c)(1)(C).

§ 26A-22 WITHDRAWAL OF LANDMARK OR HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
   (a)   Conditions for withdrawal. The approval of a structure, building,
object, site or area for certified status or as a certified historic district
(or a part thereof) may be rescinded, and such certified status withdrawn,
under any of the following conditions:
      (1)   The structure, building, object, site or area has ceased to meet
the criteria for certified status because the qualities which caused it to be
originally approved have been lost or destroyed or such qualities were lost
subsequent to nomination, but before conferral of certified status;
2013 S-4
512   Glencoe - Code of Ordinances
      (2)   Additional information shows conclusively that the structure,
building, object, site or area does not possess sufficient significance to meet
the criteria for approval of certified status;
      (3)   The original conferral of certified status was clearly in error; or
      (4)   There was prejudicial procedural error in the process of reviewing
an application for certified status.
   (b)   Requests for withdrawal. Any commissioner, the owner of any structure,
building, object or site having certified status, or 50% or more of the
property owners in an area approved as a certified historic district may
initiate a procedure to withdraw the certified status from such structure,
building, object, site or area.
   (c)   Application and hearing. A procedure to withdraw the certified status
from a structure, building, object, site or area shall be initiated by filing
an application in accordance with subsection 26A-21(c) hereof. Upon the filing
of a completed application, notice shall be given and a public hearing shall be
held in accordance with subsections 26A-21(d) and (e) hereof.
   (d)   Recommendation; determination.
      (1)   Promptly after the close of the public hearing, the commission
shall either:
         A.   Determine that withdrawal of certified status is not warranted,
which determination shall be final; or
         B.   Recommend to the board of trustees that the certified status
should be withdrawn.
      (2)   Such determination or recommendation shall be in writing and shall
set forth the reasons therefor. Any determination or recommendation shall be
submitted to the board of trustees, sent to the applicant and filed with the
village clerk.
   (e)   Board action. The board of trustees shall promptly act upon a
recommendation for withdrawal of certified status. An ordinance passed by the
affirmative vote of at least four members of the board of trustees shall be
required to rescind the approval of, and withdraw the certified status of a
structure, building, object, site or area (which withdrawal in the case of a
certified historic district may affect all or part of such district). Upon
passing an ordinance approving the withdrawal of such certified status, the
board of trustees shall direct that notice be sent to the building official,
the owners of record, the occupants (either by name or to "occupants" of the
site or sites in question), and, if known, to other persons having a legal or
equitable interest in the site or sites, advising them that such certified
status has been withdrawn. The board of trustees shall also direct that the
ordinance withdrawing the certified status from a structure, building, object,
site or area be recorded in the office of Cook County Recorder of Deeds.

(Ord. No. 90-32-1841; Ord. No. 2013-10-3340)
§ 26A-51 PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application. Any person proposing an alteration to or seeking a

application to the commission and its secretary for action.
   (b)   Notice. Within 15 days after the filing of a complete application for
a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall schedule a public
hearing to consider the application. Such hearing shall be scheduled not sooner
than 20 nor more than 45 days after the complete application is filed. The
secretary of the commission shall cause written notice by certified or
registered mail to be sent to the applicant, the legal and, if applicable,
beneficial owner or owners of the site, the occupants (either by name or to
"occupants" of the site or sites in question), and the owner or owners of
property adjacent to or across from the site, and shall also cause notice to be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village of Glencoe. Such
notice shall be given not less than 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing and
shall set forth the nature of such hearing, the site involved, and the date,
time and place of such hearing.
   (c)   Public hearing. At the public hearing, the commission shall afford all
persons present an opportunity to be heard, to express their views, and to
present evidence pertaining to the proposed alteration or demolition. The
secretary of the commission shall record these proceedings. The commission may
adjourn or continue such hearing without further public notice. Within 30 days
after the close of such hearing, the commission shall review all information
presented to it and shall either approve the certificate of appropriateness,
approve the certificate of appropriateness with conditions, deny the
certificate of appropriateness, or, in cases involving demolition, postpone the
decision to approve or deny the certificate of appropriateness.
   (d)   Approval. If the application is approved without conditions, the
commission shall issue the certificate of appropriateness permitting the
building official to proceed with other required reviews and approvals.
   (e)   Approval with conditions. If the application is approved with
conditions, the commission shall notify the applicant in writing and shall
specify the conditions to be imposed and the reasons therefore in light of the
criteria applicable to this article. If the applicant notifies the commission
in writing that the conditions are acceptable, or if the applicant does not
appeal the approval with conditions within the prescribed period of time, the
commission shall issue the certificate of appropriateness, subject to the
conditions.
   (f)   Denial. If the application is denied, the commission shall notify the
applicant in writing and shall specify the particulars in which the application
is inconsistent with the criteria applicable to this article.
   (g)   Postponement. In cases involving demolition where the commission
decides to postpone action on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the commission shall notify the applicant in writing. The
period for postponement set forth by the commission shall not extend more than
12 months beyond the close of the public hearing. During the period set forth
for postponement of the requested action, the commission shall explore
alternatives to demolition. Such alternatives may include consultation with
private civic groups, interested private citizens, and other public boards or
agencies in an effort to find a means of preserving the certified landmark or
the certified structure, building, object or site located within an established
historic district. If no alternative has been accepted by the applicant upon
expiration of the period for postponement, the commission shall, within 15 days
after such expiration date, either approve, approve with conditions or deny the
certificate of appropriateness.
   (h)   Validity. A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if the
plans approved by the commission are changed, if any conditions of the
certificate are not satisfied, or if any building permit issued for the
approved work becomes invalid. A certificate of appropriateness shall remain
valid for a period of one year.
(Ord. No. 90-32-1841; Ord. No. 2013-10-3340)
§ 26A-52 APPEAL.
   In the event the commission denies the application, approves the application
with conditions, or, in cases involving demolition, decides to postpone action
on an application, the applicant shall have the right to appeal such decisions
directly to the board of trustees.
   (a)   Time for filing appeal. An applicant may appeal the commission's
decision by filing an appeal in writing with the village clerk within 15 days
after the applicant is served with notice by certified or registered mail of
the commission's decision. For purposes of this section, the date of service
shall be the date that notice by certified or registered mail is posted.
   (b)   Hearing date. Within 15 days after applicant files an appeal, the
village clerk shall notify the village president, who shall set a date for
hearing the appeal. Such hearing date shall be scheduled no later than 45 days
after the filing of the appeal. After a hearing date has been scheduled, the
village clerk shall notify the applicant in writing, by certified or registered
mail, at least seven days prior to the hearing. The notice shall state the
date, time and place of the hearing.
   (c)   Record on appeal. Upon the filing of an appeal, the village clerk
shall obtain from the secretary of the commission a written summary of the
proceedings from the commission's public hearing. The village clerk shall also
notify the building official and chairperson of the commission of the appeal,
who shall forward to the village clerk any other relevant records and materials
regarding the application for a certificate of appropriateness. The foregoing
shall constitute the record on appeal and shall be delivered to the board of
trustees before the hearing date on the appeal.
   (d)   Hearing. At the hearing on appeal, the board of trustees shall permit
the applicant to speak in support of the application and to present any
additional evidence relating thereto. The board of trustees may also consider
testimony from village employees or officials, members of the commission, or
other interested persons. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of
trustees shall consider the record on appeal, the testimony presented on
appeal, and any other evidence and shall determine whether the commission's
decision is consistent with the criteria applicable to this article. The board
of trustees shall then vote whether to affirm or reverse the decision of the
commission in whole or in part, or to remand the application to the commission
for further review. The village clerk shall notify the applicant in writing of
the decision of the board of trustees on appeal. Except for decisions to
postpone in cases involving demolition, or to remand to the commission for
further consideration, such notice shall state that the decision of the board
of trustees is final.
   (e)   Approval. If the application is approved without conditions on appeal,
the board of trustees shall instruct the building official to issue the
certificate of appropriateness.
   (f)   Approval with conditions. If the application is approved with
conditions on appeal, the board of trustees shall specify the conditions to be
imposed and the reasons therefore in light of the criteria applicable to this
article. If the applicant notifies the board of trustees in writing that the
conditions are acceptable, or if the applicant does not further appeal the
approval with conditions, the board of trustees shall instruct the building
official to issue the certificate of appropriateness, subject to the
conditions.
   (g)   Denial. If the application is denied, the board of trustees shall
notify the applicant in writing and shall specify the particulars in which the
application is inconsistent with the criteria set forth in this article.
   (h)   Postponement. In cases involving demolition where the board of
trustees affirms the postponement of action on an application for a certificate
of appropriateness, the board of trustees shall notify the applicant in
writing. The period for postponement as affirmed or modified by the board of
trustees shall not extend more than 12 months beyond the close of the
commission's public hearing.
   (i)   Remand. If the board of trustees votes to remand an application to the
commission for further proceedings, the chairperson of the commission shall be
notified and shall set a date for a new hearing. Such date shall be no later
than 45 days after the board's decision to remand, unless the applicant waives
or extends the 45-day period in writing. If the hearing is not commenced within
such period, the commission shall instruct the building official to issue the
certificate of appropriateness. In all other instances, the hearing on remand
shall be conducted in the same manner as the original hearing before the
commission.
   (j)   Final decision; administrative review. Any final decision on a
certificate of appropriateness by the board of trustees shall be deemed a
decision directing the owner of a structure, building, object, site or area
having certified status to do or refrain from doing any specific thing, or
refusing to permit such owner to do some specific thing he or she desires to
do, in connection with such owner's property. As such, any final decision on a
certificate of appropriateness by the board of trustees may be further appealed
in accordance with the administrative review procedures of the Illinois Code of
Civil Procedure, as may be amended from time to time.
   (k)   Validity. A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if any
plans approved by the board of trustees are changed, if any conditions of such
certificate are not satisfied, or if any building permit issued for the
approved work becomes invalid. A certificate of appropriateness shall remain
valid for a period of one year.
(Ord. No. 90-32-1841; Ord. No. 2013-10-3340)
§ 26A-53 CRITERIA.
   In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the
commission and, if applicable, the board of trustees shall consider the
following criteria, as applicable.
   (a)   General standards.
      (1)   Reasonable efforts should be made to use a property for its
originally intended purpose or to provide a compatible use that requires
minimal alteration of a structure, building, object or site and its
environment.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure,
building, object or site and its environment should not be destroyed. No
alteration or demolition of any historic material or distinctive architectural
feature should be permitted except when necessary to assure an economically
viable use of a site.
      (3)   All structures, buildings, objects, sites and areas should be
recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical
basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance than the true age of the
property are discouraged.
      (4)   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a structure, building, object or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their
own right, and this significance should be recognized and respected when
dealing with a specific architectural period.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a structure, building, object, site or area should ordinarily
be maintained and preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures, buildings and objects should be
undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning
methods that will damage the structures, buildings or objects should be
avoided.
      (8)   New structures, buildings or objects or alterations to sites should
not be discouraged when such structures or alterations do not destroy
significant historical, architectural or cultural features and are compatible
with the size, scale, color, material and character of the site, neighborhood
or environment.
      (9)   Wherever possible, new structures, buildings or objects or
alterations to the existing conditions of sites should be done in such a manner
that, if such new structures or alterations were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the original structure, building, object,
site or area would be unimpaired.
      (10)   Alterations that do not affect any essential architectural or
historic features of a structure, building or object as viewed from the public
way ordinarily should be permitted.
      (11)   Any permitted alteration or demolition should promote the purposes
of this ordinance and general welfare of the village and its residents.
      (12)   Demolition should not be permitted if a structure, building,
object or site is economically viable in its present condition or could be
economically viable after completion of appropriate alterations, even if
demolition would permit a more profitable use of such site.
   (b)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Height. The height of a certified landmark after alteration should
be compatible with the height of the original landmark. The height of a
structure, building or object after alteration within an historic district
should be compatible with the height of surrounding structures, buildings and
objects within such historic district.
      (2)   Relationship between mass and open space. The relationship between
a landmark and adjacent open space after its alteration should be compatible
with such relationship prior to such alteration. The relationship between a
structure, building or object and adjacent open spaces after alteration within
an historic district should be compatible with the relationship between
surrounding structures, buildings and objects and adjacent open spaces within
such historic district.
      (3)   Relationship among height, width and scale. The relationship among
the height, width and scale of a landmark after alteration should be compatible
with such relationship prior to such alteration. The relationship among height,
width and scale of a structure, building or object after an alteration within a
historic district should be compatible with the relationship among height,
width and scale of surrounding structures, buildings and objects within such
historic district.
      (4)   Directional expression. The directional expressions of a landmark
after alteration, whether its vertical or horizontal positioning, should be
compatible with the directional expression of the original landmark. The
directional expression of a structure, building or object after alteration
within an historic district should be compatible with the directional
expression of surrounding structures, buildings and objects within such
historic district.
      (5)   Roof shape. The roof shape of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with the roof shape of the original landmark. The roof shape of a
structure, building or object after alteration within an historic district
should be compatible with the roof shape of surrounding structures, buildings
and objects within such historic district.
      (6)   Architectural details, general designs, materials, textures and
colors. The architectural details, general design, materials, textures and
colors of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the
architectural details, general design, materials, textures and colors of the
original landmark. The architectural details, general design, materials,
textures and colors of a structure, building or object after alteration within
a historic district should be compatible with the architectural details,
general design, materials, textures and colors of surrounding structures,
buildings and objects within such historic district.
      (7)   Landscape and appurtenances. The landscape and appurtenances,
including, without limitation, signs, fences, accessory structures and pavings,
of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the landscape and
appurtenances of the original landmark. The landscape and appurtenances of a
structure, building or object after alteration within an historic district
should be compatible with the landscape and appurtenances of surrounding
structures, buildings and objects within such historic district.
      (8)   Construction. New construction in an historic district should be
compatible with the architectural styles and designs within such historic
districts.
   (c)   Additional guidelines. In addition to the foregoing guidelines, the
commission may consider the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (revised 1983),
and any amendments thereto, in conducting an advisory review.
   (d)   Economic hardship. Notwithstanding the foregoing criteria, if an
applicant seeks a certificate of appropriateness on the grounds of economic
hardship, the applicant shall present sufficient evidence to the commission
and, if applicable, to the board of trustees to establish that no economically
viable use of a site can be made unless the requested change is permitted. In
order to evaluate fully a claim of economic hardship, the commission and, if
applicable, the board of trustees may require an applicant to provide any
relevant data or studies or may itself undertake or cause to undertake studies
relating to the economic viability of the site. Economic hardship shall be but
one criterion to be considered by the commission and, if applicable, by the
board of trustees.

ARTICLE IX. CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY
(Ord. No. 2007-03-3180, replaced in its entirety by Ord. No. 2007-24-3201)
§ 30-72 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (b)   Intent. In enacting this article, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased storm water run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (c)   Facilities subject to this article. This article applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this article may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (d)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this article.
   (e)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this article and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (f)   Conflicts with other articles. This article supersedes all articles or
parts of articles adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (g)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this article to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (h)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this article and may vary the standards, conditions
and requirements expressed in this article when the village so determines.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the village to
regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and
welfare.

§ 30-77 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this article on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Duration. No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that

that permits for small wireless facilities shall be subject to the duration
provided for SWF permits in §
30-92 of this article.
   (c)   Pre-construction meeting required. Unless waived in writing by the
director of public works, no construction shall begin pursuant to a permit
issued under this article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major
contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a
pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date,
time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in
attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
   (d)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of

§ 30-78 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
30-93 of this article. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.

contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (b)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (c)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (d)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.

following endorsement:
   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the
village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the village manager of such intent to cancel or not
to renew."
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of the notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to the cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (e)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection
30-79(a) of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the
extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of
additional insureds under subsection
30-79(a), or the requirements of subsections
30-79(b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under subsection
30-79(a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self
insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (f)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (g)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section

agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
article by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. A utility shall also waive any claims it my have against the
village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however
caused, based on the theory of liability.
(Ord. No. 2007-03-3180; Ord. No. 2007-24-3201; Ord. 2018-12-3443)
§ 30-81 SECURITY.
   (a)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this article;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   (b)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (c)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of
public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection
30-81(c) for any single phase.
   (d)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (e)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection
30-81(c) of this section.
   (f)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for the withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection
30-81(c) of this section.
   (g)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of the revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of the costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (h)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

(Ord. No. 2007-03-3180; Ord. No. 2007-24-3201)
§ 30-86 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the director of public works determines that
the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (b)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         A.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way line
and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole alignment
will permit;
         B.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of the
curb, where available;
         C.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         D.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         E.   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         A.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         B.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         C.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (c)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90-degree angle to the center line as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:

maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         B.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (d)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (e)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (f)   Below ground installation. Below ground facilities may be installed
only if they are located a minimum of five feet, measured from outside edge to
outside edge, from any village-owned utility.
   (g)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (h)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         A.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         B.   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         C.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         D.   The proposed method of attachment;
         E.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         F.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         G.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         H.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (i)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
   (j)   Small wireless facilities shall be subject to the additional
requirements of §
30-92 and the SWF Act.

(Ord. No. 06-09-3151).
      (1)   The subdivision is consistent with the zoning code.

nonconforming use or nonconforming lot, nor will the subdivision create,
increase or extend any existing nonconformity.
      (3)   The subdivision will accommodate development on a lot that will
comply with required setbacks and will not result in the substantial loss of
existing trees or the significant alteration of the existing topography on the
lot.
      (4)   The subdivision will not substantially modify or threaten the
integrity of natural resources, including without limitation existing steep
slopes, floodplains, wetlands, mature trees or the use of public open spaces.
      (5)   The proposed development of the subdivision will not result in an
increase in the storm water release rate from the subdivision.

electric service, natural gas and other public or private utilities available
within the village.
      (7)   The subdivision will dedicate easements or rights-of-way necessary

created by the subdivision.
      (9)   The design of the proposed street improvements meets minimum

threatens the health, safety or welfare, such as by inducing excessive speed of
travel or modifying traffic patterns in a manner inconsistent with street
design capabilities or by unnecessarily displacing pervious open spaces.

the existing village street system and recognizes the interconnection of
adjacent neighborhoods.

§ 31-1.7 MODIFICATIONS OF CERTAIN APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS BY PLAT OFFICER;
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The plat officer may modify or waive any requirement established in
article I-C of this chapter applicable to an application for a preliminary or
final plat of subdivision if the plat officer, in the exercise of his or her
reasonable discretion, determines that such waiver is appropriate in light of
all of the circumstances affecting the application, that compliance with the
requirement being waived is inappropriate, unnecessary or unduly burdensome,
and that such waiver will not have a detrimental impact on neighboring
properties and on the plan commission's ability to adequately review the
application for the subdivision nor will it be contrary to this chapter.
   (b)   The plat officer shall have administrative responsibility for
implementing the provisions of this chapter. To this end, the plat officer may
develop forms, practices and procedures consistent with the terms set forth in
this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2005-08-3128)
§ 31-1.8 VARIATIONS.
   Upon application to the plat officer, variations from the provisions of this
chapter may be authorized by the board of trustees in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
   (a)   Statement of justification. In applying for a variation from the
provisions of this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate in writing that
each of the following criteria is satisfied:
      (1)   The requested variation is in keeping with the overall purpose and
intent of this chapter;
      (2)   The grant of the requested variation will not impair the public
health, safety or general welfare and will not contravene the goals of the
comprehensive plan nor the intent of this chapter;
(Ord. No. 2006-11-3153)
      (3)   The grant of the variation will not adversely impact adjacent
properties; and
      (4)   The situation of the applicant is not of a general or recurring
nature for similarly situated properties within the village or within its
jurisdiction.
   (b)   Limitations on variations. No variation granted pursuant to this
section shall relieve an applicant from complying with every other requirement
of law. Nothing provided in this section shall be construed or applied as
authority of the board of trustees to vary any requirement of law other than
the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Conditions may be imposed. In authorizing a variation, the board of
trustees may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other
features of the proposed subdivision or development as it may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, deem necessary in the public interest, and may require the
posting of a performance guarantee to insure compliance with the conditions
imposed.
   (d)   Procedure for review of variation requests. Applications for
variations of the provisions of this chapter shall be reviewed concurrently
with the related subdivision application, except as otherwise provided by the
board of trustees on a case-by-case basis. Every such application for
variation, however, shall be heard at a public meeting of the plan commission,
which shall formulate a recommendation regarding such application for variation
as part of its recommendation on the subdivision itself. Thereafter, the board
of trustees shall consider the variation at a public meeting, but only after
notice thereof given to the applicant in writing not less than five days nor
more than 30 days before such public meeting. An application for a variation
shall be deemed to be a waiver by the applicant of any prescribed time
limitations on the plan commission or board of trustees in their respective
reviews of the subdivision application affected by the variation request.
(Ord. No. 2005-08-3128)
§ 31-1.9 BUILDING PERMITS AND WORK AUTHORIZATIONS.
   Except as specifically provided otherwise in writing by the board of
trustees in an approved development agreement, annexation agreement or other
agreement:
   (a)   General prohibition. No permit, authorization or approval shall be
issued for any work within any subdivision until after final engineering plans
for all required public improvements have been approved by the village as
provided in this chapter, appropriate security has been posted as provided in §
31-1.17(e) of this chapter, and a plat of the subdivision as recorded in the
office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds has been filed with the plat
officer; and
   (b)   Minimum required public improvements. No building permit for any
habitable structure on any lot or site within a subdivision shall be issued
until all required public improvements have been completed pursuant to the
final engineering plans. To the extent this requirement is modified by an
agreement duly approved by the board of trustees, and notwithstanding anything
contrary in such agreement if approved after the effective date of this
provision, no building permit for any habitable structure on any lot or site
within a subdivision shall be issued until after such site or lot is served by
public water and sewer and a street improved at least through binder course.
(Ord. No. 2005-08-3128)
§ 31-1.10 INTERPRETATIONS.
   On application in writing on a form provided by the village, the plat
officer shall render formal written interpretations of the provisions of this
chapter. Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having an
interest in the circumstances giving rise to the need for an interpretation;
provided, however, that interpretations shall not be given based solely on
hypothetical facts or when the interpretation would have no effect other than
as an advisory opinion. The plat officer shall render the requested
interpretation within 45 days after the receipt of a properly completed
application therefor. The failure of the plat officer to act within the time
period specified in this section, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision of the plat officer denying the
application. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the plat officer may be
taken as provided in §
31-1.11 of this chapter. Interpretations made by the plat officer are intended
to foster the consistent and effective implementation of this chapter and not
to delegate legislative authority to the plat officer.
(Ord. No. 2005-08-3128)
§ 31-1.11 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by a decision or interpretation of the plat officer
pursuant to this chapter may appeal such decision or interpretation by filing
with the village clerk a notice of appeal within 30 days after such decision or
interpretation is made. The board of trustees shall cause notice to be given to
the person making the appeal (and, if different, to the applicant of the
subject property under such appeal) of a public meeting before the board of
trustees to review such appeal. Such public meeting shall be held not fewer
than five days nor more than 45 days after the appeal has been filed and notice
in accordance with the preceding sentence has been given. In making its
decision, the board of trustees shall give proper deference to the reasonable
decisions and interpretations of those charged with the administration of this
chapter. The board of trustees shall make a decision on the appeal within 60
days after the public meeting. The board of trustees may affirm, modify or
reverse, in whole or in part, the decision or interpretation appealed from and
may include such order or determination in its decision as the board of
trustees determines, in the exercise of its discretion, is appropriate and
proper under the circumstances. The decision of the board of trustees shall be
final. The failure of the board of trustees to act within the time periods
specified in this section, or within such further time or times to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision of the board of trustees
denying the appeal in its entirety.

§ 31-1.20 PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW.
   (a)   As a prerequisite to any preliminary plat application or application
for approval of a plat of vacation, and following receipt of the pre-
application review submittals in accordance with §
31-1.14, the plat officer and such other persons that the plat officer may
designate shall meet with the applicant to review the proposed plat, the
procedures for reviewing such plat and any issues that may relate to such plat,
including its conformity with the requirements of law. In addition, the plat
officer shall define with particularity for the applicant the form, scope and
content of the mailed and posted notices to be undertaken in connection with
the preliminary, final or vacation plat review for the subject property, as
well as the certifications relating to such notices.
   (b)   A applicant may propose during the pre-application review that the

both the requirements for preliminary and final plat approval; provided,
however, that the plan commission will, in its sole discretion, have the
ultimate authority to determine whether such preliminary and final plats shall
be reviewed separately or concurrently, taking into account the public's
ability to participate effectively in the plat review process. In the event
that the plan commission accepts the concurrent presentation of preliminary and
final plats, the plan commission may recommend both the preliminary and final
plat, the preliminary plat only, or neither plat for approval to the board of
trustees. In addition, any required notices shall expressly state that both the
preliminary and final plats will be considered at the scheduled public meeting.

      (2)   The plat officer shall review the application for approval of a
preliminary plat for general completeness; for compliance with requirements of
law, including, without limitation, the application requirements established in
article I-C of this chapter; and for technical accuracy. Within 15 days after
the date of filing of the application, the plat officer shall notify the
applicant either that the application has been accepted for processing, or that
the application may not be processed because of deficiencies or inaccuracies in
it. Every deficient or inaccurate application shall be returned to the
applicant. If the plat officer determines that the application for approval of
preliminary plat should be accepted for processing, then the plat officer shall
refer the application to all appropriate staff members and committees for
review.
   (b)   Notice of public meeting.
      (1)   After receipt of all required information, payment of all required
fees, and satisfactory general review pursuant to subsection
31-1.21(a) of this section, the plat officer shall notify the applicant of the
date that the application will be conditionally scheduled for review at a
public meeting of the plan commission. Such date shall be determined in light
of the plan commission's pending docket and the notification deadlines as set
forth in this subsection
31-1.21(b).
      (2)   Upon the conditional scheduling of a public meeting to review an
application for preliminary plat approval, the applicant shall deliver to the
plat officer for mailing notices to the occupants of all properties within 300
feet of the subject property, as determined during the pre-application review;
the plat officer shall review such notices for completeness and accuracy and,
if complete and accurate, promptly cause such notices to be mailed; provided
that such mailings are mailed not more than 30 nor less than 15 days before the
scheduled public meeting date.
      (3)   In addition, upon the conditional scheduling of a public meeting to
review an application for preliminary plat approval, the applicant shall
present to the plat officer the proposed signage, as determined during the pre-
application review, for posting on the subject property. The plat officer shall
review such signage for compliance and, if determined to be in compliance, the
plat officer shall direct the applicant where to post such signage on the
subject property; provided that such posting shall commence not more than 45
nor less than 30 days before the scheduled public meeting date. The village
shall also post, within the village hall, a notice of the availability to
review proposed application documents not less than 30 days before the
scheduled meeting date.
      (4)   If the notices required pursuant to this subsection cannot be
mailed and posted within the required time periods, then the public meeting
shall be re-scheduled to ensure that such notice periods can be satisfied.
   (c)   Determination of completeness of application. Provided that the plat
officer makes a general determination of completeness pursuant to subsection
31-1.21(a)(2) of this chapter, and provided the notices are timely given in
accordance with subsection
31-1.21(b) of this chapter, then the applicant shall deliver to the plat
officer a completed certificate of notice in the form determined during the
pre-application review on the date of the scheduled public meeting (and, if
delivered sooner, shall be deemed delivered on the date of the scheduled public
meeting). The delivery of such completed certificate of notice on the date of
the scheduled public meeting shall be the final element of the application for
preliminary plat approval and shall represent the completion of the applicant's
application for purposes of any statutory periods for undertaking and
completing the village's review of an application for preliminary plat
approval; provided, however, that any material change to such application after
the commencement of the public hearing shall be deemed the filing of a new item
in support of the application and shall restart any such statutory review
period.
   (d)   Action by the plan commission. The plan commission shall conduct a
public meeting to review the preliminary plat in accordance with the notices
mailed and posted published pursuant to subsection
31-1.21(b) of this section. Within 90 days after the completion of the
applicant's application for preliminary plat approval, the plan commission
shall recommend whether the preliminary plat should be approved, approved with
modifications or conditions or disapproved; and shall transmit such
recommendation to the board of trustees. The plan commission may recommend
approval of a plat subject to certain conditions or modifications as are deemed
necessary in the interests and needs of the community. The failure of the plan
commission to act within the time period specified in this subsection, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
recommendation of the plan commission to disapprove the preliminary plat.
   (e)   Action by board of trustees. The board of trustees, within 30 days
after its next regularly scheduled meeting following the transmission of a
recommendation by the plan commission on an application for preliminary plat
approval, shall disapprove the preliminary plat or shall approve it by
ordinance or resolution duly adopted. Any approval of a preliminary plat may be
subject to certain conditions or modifications as are deemed necessary in the
interests and needs of the community. If the board of trustees disapproves the
preliminary plat, then the plat officer shall notify the applicant in writing
of the reasons stated for such disapproval. The failure of the board of
trustees to act within the time period specified in this subsection, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision
of the board of trustees disapproving the preliminary plat.
   (f)   Effect of approval. The approval of a preliminary plat by the board of
trustees is strictly tentative in nature, involving merely the general
acceptability of the layout as submitted. Approval of the preliminary plat
shall be deemed solely as permission for the applicant to prepare a final plat
of subdivision, including detailed plans and specifications for the subdivision
and public improvements in accordance with the preliminary plat and within the
requirements of this chapter. Approval of a preliminary plat shall not entitle
the applicant to any other approval or issuance of any permit until after all
of the standards and procedures for such other approval or issuance of a permit
have been satisfied.
   (g)   Limitation on preliminary plat approval. Every approval by the board
of trustees of a preliminary plat of subdivision shall be effective for a
maximum period of 12 months after the date of approval unless, pursuant to a
written application therefor filed by the applicant before the expiration of
the preliminary plat approval, the board of trustees grants an extension of
that 12-month period. If, within the 12-month period, no extension of time has
been granted by the board of trustees and no application for approval of a
final plat of subdivision has been filed with the plat officer, then the
applicant must resubmit an application for approval of a preliminary plat for
full review of the plan commission and board of trustees.
   (h)   Statement of disapproval. If the plan commission or board of trustees
shall disapprove a preliminary plat pursuant to this section, then the plan
commission or board of trustees (as the case may be) shall deliver to the
applicant a statement of such disapproval. Such statement shall set forth with
particularity the grounds for disapproving the application for preliminary
plat. Such statement shall be furnished to the applicant within the time period
for plan commission or board of trustees action as set forth in subsections
31-1.21(d) and
31-1.21(e) of this section.

forth in this subsection
31-1.22(b).
      (2)   Upon the conditional scheduling of a public meeting to review an
application for final plat approval, the applicant shall deliver to the plat
officer for mailing notices to the occupants of all properties within 300 feet
of the subject property, as determined during the pre-application review; the
plat officer shall review such notices for completeness and accuracy and, if

such mailings are mailed not more than 45 nor less than 30 days before the
scheduled public meeting date.
      (3)   In addition, upon the conditional scheduling of a public meeting to
review an application for final plat approval, the applicant shall present to
the plat officer the proposed signage, as determined during the pre-application

provided that such posting shall commence not more than 30 nor less than 15
days before the scheduled public meeting date.
      (4)   If the notices required pursuant to this subsection cannot be
mailed and posted within the required time periods, then the public meeting
shall be re-scheduled to ensure that such notice periods can be satisfied.
   (c)   Determination of completeness of application. Provided that the plat
officer makes a general determination of completeness pursuant to subsection
31-1.22(a)(2) of this chapter, and provided the notices are timely given in
accordance with subsection
31-1.22(b) of this chapter, then the applicant shall deliver a completed
certificate of notice in the form determined during the pre-application review
to the plat officer on the date of the scheduled public meeting (and, if
delivered sooner, shall be deemed delivered on the date of the scheduled public
meeting). The delivery of such completed certificate of notice on the date of
the scheduled public meeting shall be the final element of the application for
final plat approval and shall represent the completion of the applicant's
application for purposes of any statutory periods for undertaking and
completing the village's review of a application for final plat approval;
provided, however, that any material change to such application after the
commencement of the public hearing shall be deemed the filing of a new item in
support of the application and shall restart any such statutory review period.
   (d)   Action by the plan commission. The plan commission shall conduct a
public meeting to review the final plat in accordance with the notice published
pursuant to subsection
31-1.22(b) of this section. Within 15 days after the commencement of the public
meeting (or such longer period to which the applicant may agree), the plan
commission shall recommend whether the final plat should be approved, approved
with modifications or conditions, or disapproved; and shall transmit such
recommendation to the board of trustees. The plan commission may recommend
approval of a final plat subject to certain conditions or modifications as are
deemed necessary in the interests and needs of the community. The failure of
the plan commission to act within the time period specified in this subsection,
or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
recommendation of the plan commission to disapprove the final plat.
   (e)   Action by board of trustees. The board of trustees, within 45 days
after receipt of the report of the plan commission, shall disapprove the final
plat or shall approve it by ordinance or resolution duly adopted. Any approval
of a final plat may be subject to certain conditions or modifications as are
deemed necessary in the interests and needs of the community. If the board of
trustees disapproves the final plat, then the plat officer shall notify the
applicant in writing of the reasons stated for such disapproval. The failure of
the board of trustees to act within the time period specified in this
subsection, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision of the board of trustees disapproving the final plat.
Approval of a final plat shall not entitle the applicant to any other approval
or issuance of any permit until after all of the standards and procedures for
such other approval or issuance of a permit have been satisfied, and such
approval shall be subject in any event to the requirements of subsection
31-1.22(f) of this section.

STANDARDS.
   (a)   The proposed subdivision shall conform to all applicable requirements
of the Glencoe zoning code and shall be consistent with the Village of Glencoe
comprehensive plan ordinance. The comprehensive plan ordinance goals include
maintaining the existing environmental assets of the village, preserving and
protecting mature trees and existing landscaping, and guiding, controlling and

requirements of the zoning code. Outside the corporate limits, the minimum area
of each proposed lot shall be not less than the minimum lot area required by
the zoning regulations of the county for the district in which the proposed lot
is located. Lots shall be generally geometrically shaped and not irregular or
of a shape that substantially deviates from the consistent pattern established

§ 31-3.3 TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION.
   (a)   The comprehensive plan ordinance recognizes that trees and mature
landscaping, as well as the ecology of the community, are important
characteristics of the village and should be preserved and protected. In
furtherance thereof, the village enacted tree preservation regulations in
article III of
chapter 34 of the Glencoe village code. All subdivisions shall comply with the
village's tree preservation regulations in article III of
chapter 34.
   (b)   In additional to complying with article III of

accordance with §
31-4.1. In addition, when the village determines that additional landscaping is
desirable or necessary to mitigate the impact of any new buildings or
structures on any lot to be created within a subdivision, the subdivision
approval may be conditioned upon the installation of additional landscaping on
such lot to screen any new buildings or structures on that lot from an adjacent
lot or from the street, or both, in accordance with the landscaping guidelines
set forth in the Engineering Standards and Specifications Manual. If such
additional landscaping is required, the applicant shall submit, for the review
and approval of the village, a detailed landscaping plan depicting the
additional landscaping. In addition, the village may require the applicant to
provide performance security and guaranty security for the landscaping, which
security shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of article IV of
this chapter.
(Ord. No. 06-09-3151)
§ 31-3.5 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT.
   The topography of the proposed subdivision shall be preserved wherever
possible in its natural state by minimizing grade changes on the property. No
grade change shall be permitted that would require the installation of a
retaining wall or other engineered device within any required yard to protect
or support the subject property or any adjacent lot. Areas on a lot designated
for development shall be designed so as to preserve the natural features of the
lot, avoid disturbance of areas of environmental sensitivity, including
wetlands, floodplains, slopes in excess of 15%, ravines and habitat of
endangered wildlife, and minimize negative impacts to or alteration of natural
features. The existing landscape shall be preserved in its natural state by
minimizing the removal or destruction of existing trees and other natural
features on the property, so that the resulting development shall be in keeping
with the general appearance of the surrounding area and will not adversely
affect the ecology of the area.
(Ord. No. 06-09-3151)
§ 31-3.6 GRADING AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   (a)   The subdivision shall be developed in strict accordance with all
applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, codes and regulations related to grading
and storm water retention, detention and drainage, including without limitation
§§
9-82 and
9-83 of the village code, as well as in strict accordance with the grading
plans and profiles approved as part of the approved engineering plans.
   (b)   No grade change shall be permitted that would:
      (1)   Modify storm water drainage on the subject property or an adjacent
lot;
      (2)   Adversely impact the capacity or operation of the village's storm
water system; or
      (3)   Affect the structural stability of an adjacent lot, unless the
village engineer, in his or her sole determination, approves in writing an
alternative means that will adequately provide for the collection and diversion
of storm water.
   (c)   No grading plan shall be approved that, in the village engineer's
determination, poses potential adverse impacts to the environment including,
without limitation, significant change to the rate of storm water run-off, rate
or volume of sedimentation, or location of discharge. In addition, no grading
plan shall be approved that, in the village engineer's determination, fails to
provide adequate setback from any ravine or bluff.
(Ord. No. 06-09-3151)
§ 31-3.7 UTILITIES.
   All utilities necessary for the subdivision shall be constructed in
accordance with article IV of this
chapter 31, and shall be installed underground, unless expressly approved by
the village engineer upon payment of a fee to the village in an amount equal to
the costs of burying the utilities underground, as determined by the village
engineer. When the village engineer determines that a storm sewer, sanitary
sewer or water supply system should be designed and constructed larger than is
immediately required to serve the subdivision, the applicant may be reimbursed
for the additional costs of such over-sizing, as determined by the village
engineer, pursuant to a recapture agreement in accordance with state statute.

sewer, water, storm drainage, gas lines, electric lines, telephone, cable
television, streets, pathways, sidewalks and other necessary public or private
purposes in order to adequately serve the proposed subdivision. The easements
shall be depicted on the preliminary and final plats of subdivision in
accordance with §§
31-1.16 and
31-1.18. The size and location of all such easements shall be subject to the
approval of the village engineer, and the terms of all such easements shall be
subject to the approval of the village engineer and village attorney.
(Ord. No. 06-09-3151)
§ 31-3.9 LOT ACCESS AND CIRCULATION.
   All subdivisions shall be designed to provide appropriate public street
access to all lots in the subdivision, which access shall be designated on the

§ 31-3.11 PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION OR FEES IN-LIEU.
   (a)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   It is declared to be the policy of the village that the provision
of various public facilities required to serve new residential development is
subject to the control of the village in accordance with the comprehensive plan
of the village for the orderly, planned, efficient and economical development
of the village.
      (2)   New residential developments cause and impose increased and
excessive demands upon public facilities and services that are specifically and
uniquely attributable to those new residential developments. Affected
facilities and services include public schools and parks.
      (3)   Planning projections indicate that new residential development
shall continue and shall place ever-increasing demands on the school districts,
park district, the village and other governmental bodies to provide necessary
public facilities.
      (4)   Development potential and property values are influenced and
affected by village policy as expressed in the comprehensive plan and as
implemented by the village zoning code and other village regulations.
      (5)   To the extent that new residential developments place demands upon
public facilities that are specifically and uniquely attributable to such
developments, those demands should be satisfied by requiring that the new
residential developments creating the demands pay the cost of meeting the
demands.
      (6)   The amount of the development impact fees to be required of new
residential developments shall reflect the proportionate share of the cost of
the additional public facilities needed to support such residential
developments and shall be calculated to ensure that new residential
developments pay only that portion of the costs of acquiring needed lands and,
to the extent permitted by law, the needed facilities specifically and uniquely
attributable to the new residential developments.
      (7)   The village board, after careful consideration, hereby finds and
declares that imposition of development impact fees upon new residential
developments to finance the acquisition of certain land and, to the extent
permitted by law, other specified public facilities, the demand for which is
created by such residential developments within the village, is in the best
interests of the general welfare of the village and its residents, is
equitable, and does not impose an unfair burden on such developments.
Therefore, the village board deems it necessary and desirable to adopt this
section as herein set forth.
   (b)   Applicability. This section requires payment of development impact
fees, payable no later than the time of issuance of a building permit, in an
amount equal to the proportionate share of the cost of the various public
facilities required to serve residential developments. The fees for school and
park site developments shall be uniformly applicable to all "residential
development," as defined herein.

calculate development impact fees due from any particular residential
development pursuant to and in accordance with this section, and the village
manager shall present such calculations in writing to the developer and to each
public body eligible to receive development impact fees due from any particular
residential development. Development impact fees due from any particular
residential development shall be collected no later than before the issuance of
any building permit for any particular residential development. A developer may
challenge the calculation or imposition of development impact fees by filing a
written objection with the village clerk within ten days after receipt of the
calculation from the village manager. Such objection shall set forth with
particularity the basis for challenging the calculation and shall be
accompanied by any evidence supporting such objection. In addition, if
requested by the village manager, the developer shall obtain or provide such
other information as may be reasonably requested for purposes of evaluating the
developer's objection. The final determination of calculation or applicability
of development impact fees shall be made by the village board, in its sole
discretion, based upon such information submitted by the developer and from
other sources available to the village board or that may be submitted to the
village board by a public body.
      (2)   Collection of development impact fees.
         A.   Public bodies with intergovernmental agreements. Any development
impact fees due to a public body pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement and
the provisions of this article shall be collected by such public body, and the
developer shall be required to deliver to the village clerk a receipt from each
affected public body evidencing delivery of such development impact fees.
Unless expressly provided otherwise in a development agreement approved by the
village, the developer shall not be entitled to any further permits, approvals
or authorizations relating to the residential development until the developer
delivers such receipt of payments to the village.
         B.   Public bodies without intergovernmental agreements. Any
development impact fees relating to public facilities for public bodies that
have not entered into intergovernmental agreements with the village pursuant to
this section shall be paid to the village and collected by the village manager,
who shall hold such development impact fees in trust for the affected public
body or bodies. Unless expressly provided otherwise in a development agreement
approved by the village, the developer shall not be entitled to any further
permits, approvals or authorizations relating to the residential development
until the developer delivers such payments to the village.
      (3)   Transfer of funds to accounts.
         A.   Upon receipt of development impact fees, the village manager
shall forward such fees to the director of finance. In addition:
            1.   The director of finance shall establish an account in a bank
authorized to receive deposits of village funds;
            2.   The development impact fees deposited in the account shall be
used solely for the purposes of and in accordance with this section; and
            3.   The director of finance shall maintain and keep adequate
financial records for the account, which shall show the source and disbursement
of all revenues, and which shall account for all money received. Such records
shall account for money received as being funds allocable to the particular
public body to which the funds are allocable under this section.
         B.   Whenever the village manager receives development impact fees in
trust pursuant to subsection
31-3.11(d)(2)B., the director of finance shall separately account for such fees
held in trust.
      (4)   Disbursement of funds.
         A.   In order to ensure that each distribution of development impact
fees from the account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of
projects consistent with the applicable needs assessment on file with the
village, prior to the village board authorizing disbursement of any such funds
in accord with this section, the village clerk shall be in receipt of each of
the following:
            1.   A fully executed intergovernmental agreement between the
village and the public body receiving such funds governing certain aspects of
the implementation of this section by the village and the public body; and
            2.   A fully executed subdivision agreement. The amount of
development impact fees due for the pro rata share of the costs of public
facilities servicing the residential development shall be incorporated into the
subdivision agreement.
         B.   No final plat of subdivision shall be approved and recorded for
any residential development until the village clerk has received the fully
executed subdivision agreement required pursuant to subsection
31-3.11(d)(4)A.2. No impact fees shall be disbursed until the village clerk has
received the fully executed intergovernmental agreement required pursuant to
subsection
31-3.11(d)(4)A.1. of this section.
   (e)   Use of development impact fees. Development impact fees paid pursuant
to this section shall be restricted to use solely and exclusively for paying
the cost of public facilities, whether payment is made directly therefor, or as
a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates or other obligations of
indebtedness.
   (f)   Effect of development impact fees on zoning and subdivision
regulations. This section shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use
of property, density of development, design and improvement standards and
requirements; or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of
public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other
applicable regulations of the village, which shall be operative and remain in
full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.
   (g)   Development impact fees as additional and supplemental requirement.
Development impact fees are additional and supplemental to, and not in
substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the village on the
development or subdivision of land or the issuance of building permits. In no
event shall a property owner be obligated to pay for public facilities in an
amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this section; but a
property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to village ordinances,
regulations or policies, for other public facilities in addition to the
development impact fees for public facilities as specified herein.
   (h)   Land in lieu of development impact fees.
      (1)   Prior to any preliminary plat approval (or such later time as the
village board may, in its discretion, allow), a public body may make a request
in writing to the village board to allow for a donation of land in lieu of
development impact fees related to any development. Such a request shall
specifically itemize the public body's reasons for requesting land in lieu of
development impact fees.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a request from a public body for land in lieu of
development impact fees, the village board shall consider and perform an
analysis of such request, and make a determination thereon by resolution duly
adopted. The resolution shall be based upon a review of the needs assessment on
file with the village clerk for the public body making the request, as well as
the following factors:
         A.   Other developments occurring in the prior year within the
surrounding area of the residential development;
         B.   Public facilities actually constructed and servicing the
surrounding area of the residential development;
         C.   Changing public facility needs and capacity at existing public
facilities servicing the surrounding area of the residential development; and
         D.   Such other factors as the village board may deem to be relevant.
      (3)   Requests of land in lieu of development impact fees shall be made
specifically for public facilities or expansion of public facilities on
adjacent parcels.
   (i)   Preparation of needs assessments.
      (1)   Each public body shall periodically prepare a study to assess the
need for additional public facilities.
      (2)   The study may consist of a detailed examination or analysis of
existing public facilities, service standards and/or research regarding sites.
      (3)   Such study should also reflect:
         A.   Development occurring in the prior years;
         B.   Public facilities actually constructed;
         C.   Changing public facility needs;
         D.   Inflation;
         E.   Revised cost estimates for public facilities;
         F.   Changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable
to public facility projects; and
         G.   Such other factors as may be relevant.
      (4)   Each public body shall maintain on file with the village clerk its
most recent needs assessment study.
      (5)   In addition, the village may request, as a condition of calculating
or disbursing any development impact fees from any particular residential
development, that the public body certify that the needs assessment study on
file with the village clerk reasonably reflects such public body's need for
public facilities.
      (6)   Two or more public bodies may join together in the preparation of a
needs assessment provided the assessment ultimately contains the information
required under this section for each service area served by each such public
body.
   (j)   Use and content of needs assessment.
      (1)   A needs assessment shall contain the following information for each
service area described in the assessment:
         A.   An inventory of existing lands and buildings utilized by the
public body to provide services within the service area;
         B.   An identification of the area of each building within a service
area and, in the case of schools, the number of students then enrolled in each
school building;
         C.   A projection of the character of residential development that is
expected to occur during the succeeding ten-year period that will be affecting
any service area;
         D.   An identification of the amount of lands that will be necessary
for each service area in order to accommodate the demands of the projected
residential development; and
         E.   A general description of the total building area and, in the case
of schools, temporary classrooms, if any, that will be necessary for each
service area in order to provide capacity for the projected residential
development.
      (2)   Public bodies that complete needs assessments for the acquisition
of lands shall periodically update those needs assessments and shall amend
their adopted lands acquisition plan based on those updated needs assessments.
   (k)   Source information for population estimate variable in impact fee
formulas.
      (1)   Calculation of required development impact fees or land dedication,
as set forth in this section, shall be made in accordance with the population
density projections contained in the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit, as defined in this section.
      (2)   In the event a developer files a written objection, within ten days
after receiving notice of the development impact fee calculation pursuant to
subsection
31-3.11(d)(1), to the use of the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit, the developer shall obtain and submit, at his or her own cost, a
demographic study showing the estimated population to be generated from the
residential development; and in that event, final determination of the density
formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board, in
its sole discretion, based upon such demographic information submitted by the
developer and from other sources available to the village board or that may be
submitted to the village board by a public body.
   (l)   Determination of land value and distribution of development impact
fees.
      (1)   Determination of land value. The development impact fees for public
facilities shall be based on the fair market value of an acre of land for such
facilities. For purposes of this section, the FAIR MARKET VALUE of an acre of
land in and surrounding the village shall be no less than $1,000,000 which
amount may be adjusted from time to time by ordinance or resolution of the
village board. Such land value shall be used in making any calculations
required in this section unless the developer files a written objection within
ten days after receiving notice of the development impact fee calculation
pursuant to subsection
31-3.11(d)(1). In the event of any such objection, the developer, at his or her
own cost, shall obtain and submit an independent appraisal from an MAI
designated appraiser indicating the fair market value of such improved land in
the area of the proposed development. Final determination of the fair market
value per acre of such land shall be made by the village board in its sole
discretion based on such information submitted by the developer and from other
sources which may be submitted to the village board by the public bodies or
others.
      (2)   Distribution of development impact fees. The development impact fee
for public facilities shall be collected in accordance with subsection
31-3.11(d)(2) and shall be used solely for public facilities of the public
bodies for which such development impact fees are designated. Provided the
village clerk has in his or her possession the respective agreements and
indemnities of the public bodies as required by this section, any development
impact fees so collected and held by the village shall be forwarded from time
to time to the respective public body to be used in the funding of building
sites and public facilities and for other purposes as permitted by law in
accordance with the applicable intergovernmental agreement.
   (m)   Criteria for determining school site development impact fee. The
following criteria shall govern the calculation of the school site development
impact fee.
      (1)   Service area requirement and population ratio. The school
development impact fee shall be calculated based on the amount of land that
would be required for a school site in light of the ultimate number of students
to be generated by the residential development.
         A.   The school site development impact fee requirement shall be
determined by obtaining the product of the following:
            1.   Estimated number of students to be generated by the
residential development within each school classification, as derived from the
most current version of the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling
unit; over
            2.   The maximum recommended number of students to be served in
each such school classification as established in this section; times
            3.   The recommended number of acres for a school site of each
school classification as established in this section.
         B.   The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to
have sufficient school site land to serve the estimated increased number of
students in each such school classification. The school site development impact
fee shall be the cash amount, rounded upward to the nearest $5 increment, equal
to the product of the number of acres required for school sites times 82.90% of
the fair market value of land per acre established in this section.
      (2)   School classification and size of school site. School
classifications and the size of school building sites within the village shall
be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
 
School Classification by Grade Capacity Acres
Elementary or grade K-5        600      11
Junior high or grades 6-8      900      29

amount of land that would be required for park purposes in light of the
ultimate number of individuals to be generated by the residential development.
         B.   The public facilities that would be required for park purposes
shall be directly related to the ultimate population to be generated by the
residential development.
         C.   The park development impact fee requirement shall be determined
by obtaining the product of the following:
            1.   Estimated population to be served by the park system, as
derived from the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit; over
            2.   One thousand; times
            3.   The sum of the recommended number of acres of park site for
each park classification as established in this section.
         D.   The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to
have sufficient park site land to serve the estimated increased population.
         E.   The park development impact fee shall be the cash amount, rounded
upward to the nearest $5 increment, equal to the product of the number of acres
required for park site times 20.25% of the fair market value of land per acre
established in this section.
      (2)   Park site classification and acreage per population. Park site
classifications and the minimum acres of park site per 1,000 population shall
be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
 
Type of Park      Size Range in Acres Minimum Acres per 1,000 Population
Mini park         1 - 3               0.5

            1.   Such information and data as the developer believes will
support its objection, as well as:
            2.   Such information as the village manager may request relating
to either the particular dwelling unit for which a building permit is sought or
to all dwelling units to be constructed within a new residential development.
         D.   Final determination of the classification of any dwelling unit
shall be made by the village board based on the information provided by the
developer, other relevant and available information and the terms of this
section.
      (3)   Corrective adjustment of development impact fee. In the event that
the village board has modified the general rule in subsection
31-3.11(o)(1) at the request of a developer pursuant to subsection
31-3.11(o)(2) for a particular dwelling unit or units, and a subsequent
building permit application is presented for any such dwelling unit that would
have required a larger development impact fee but for the adjustment approved
pursuant to the developer's request under this subsection, no building permit
shall be issued for such dwelling unit unless the developer of that dwelling
unit pays a corrective development impact fee. The corrective development
impact fee shall be equal to 115% of the applicable development impact fee for
such dwelling unit as calculated at the time of the building permit application
less the development impact fee initially paid in connection with such dwelling
unit.
   (p)   Credit for net reduction of any or all lots, dwelling units or
bedrooms.
      (1)   Where a new residential development involves a net reduction in the
number of any or all of the lots, dwelling units or bedrooms on the property on
which the development is, or is to be, located, and development impact fees had
previously been paid in connection with an earlier development of such
property, the developer may request a credit for a net reduction, calculated on
a "per unit of public body" basis. Such request shall be filed within 30 days
after a new residential development receives final zoning and subdivision
approval, where and as applicable, but prior to the presentation of any final
plat or development agreement for execution by the village or any of its
officials. The credit due the developer shall be the proportion of such net
reduction to the number of lots, dwelling units or bedrooms for which
development impact fees were previously paid in connection with the development
of the property, but in no event shall such credit reduce the amount of
development impact fees due in connection with the new residential development
to less than zero, nor shall any credit against the development impact fee due
to one public body be used to offset development impact fees due other public
bodies calculated by reason of the new residential development.
      (2)   In the event a developer is entitled to a credit for the net
reduction of the number of any or all of the lots, dwelling units or bedrooms
on the property on which the development is, or is to be, located, and more
than one lot is created from the property on which such unit or units were
located, the credit shall be equally divided among all such newly created lots.
The amount of such credit due per lot shall be determined prior to recording a
new plat of subdivision, and the amount of the credit for each such lot shall
be set forth in the subdivision agreement, or applicable agreement, prior to
recordation.
   (q)   Reservation of additional land. Pursuant to this
chapter 31, the village has made provision for school sites, park sites and
public land. In addition, the village has in its comprehensive plan designated
land that may be appropriate for development as school sites, park sites or
public land. As a result of such provisions and designations:
      (1)   Where land is requested in lieu of a development impact fee or in
lieu of more than 50% of a development impact fee; and
      (2)   The comprehensive plan, or the standards of the village, or the
needs assessment of a public body call for a larger park site or school site in
a particular residential development than the developer is required to
dedicate, then any land within the development so designated in the village's
comprehensive plan will be reserved in accordance with § 11-12-8 of the
Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8 for subsequent purchase by the
village or other public body designated by the village. Such reservation will
terminate within one year from the date of approval of the final plat unless a
negotiated purchase is made or eminent domain proceedings are commenced within
such one-year period, or an agreement between the developer and the village is
recorded outlining specific conditions for the conveyance of such property.
(Ord. No. 08-17-3228)
   (r)   Combining with adjoining development. Where land is requested in lieu
of a development impact fee and the residential development is less than 40
acres, where practical, a park site or school site should be combined with
dedications from adjoining residential developments in order to produce a
usable park site or school site without undue hardship on a particular
developer.
   (s)   General site standards. The slope, topography and geology of any
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purpose. Wetlands, storm water detention areas and retention areas shall not be
accepted for village ownership and maintenance, nor shall such lands be
credited against development impact fees if accepted by a park district for
ownership and maintenance. A park site shall be not less than one acre in area.
Wetlands, detention areas, retention areas and areas of steep slope shall not
be accepted as school sites.
   (t)   School site standards.
      (1)   A school site shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full
infrastructure improvements as required by this code, including, but not
limited to, electrical service, water service, sanitary sewer, storm sewer and
street improvements.
      (2)   Depending upon projected timing for the construction of school
facilities, a cash contribution may be required in lieu of the sidewalk and
street tree improvements.
      (3)   The cash contribution shall be equal to the cost of such
improvements consistent with approved engineering plans and estimates of cost.

public and other required improvements for which the reduction is sought have
been completed, inspected and approved by the village engineer.
      (2)   In no event shall the amount of the performance security be reduced
to a level that:
         A.   Would not allow the village to complete the installation of the
public and other improvements required for the subdivision, in the sole and
absolute opinion of the village engineer and village manager; or
         B.   Is less than the guaranty security required by §
31-4.5.
   (f)   Release of performance security. Following the village engineer's
certification that all public and other required improvements included in the
security have been completed to the satisfaction of the village engineer, and
the village's acceptance of all public improvements in accordance with all
requirements of §

the form and substance of which shall be acceptable to the village attorney.
The guarantee security shall insure the village against any defects in the work
performed and materials used in the construction of the public improvements for
two years after the village's acceptance of the public improvements. Such
security, as approved by the village attorney, shall be delivered to the
village prior to acceptance of the public improvements.

         A.   Any tree or part of a tree which is dead which could potentially
fall on a person or structure is defined as a nuisance.
         B.   It shall be unlawful for any owner of any lot or land in the
village to permit or maintain on any such lot or land, any tree which is dead,
or declining to the state where it may create a potential risk for structures
or people. It shall be the duty of any such owner to promptly cause the removal
of any such tree.

laboratory analysis or another method of analysis approved by the village
arborist and paid for by the owner, are declared to be a public nuisance, and
shall be removed within 30 days following notification of the discovery of such

treatment program overseen by a licensed arborist hired by the owner and
approved by the village arborist. It shall be unlawful for the owner of real
estate where such a tree is situated to possess or keep such a tree, after the
expiration of 30 days following notification issued by the village of the
discovery of said infection, unless the owner initiates and maintains a
treatment program overseen by a licensed arborist and approved by the village
arborist. See 65 ILCS 5/11-20-12(c) for definition of "treatment".

abate the nuisances under this section shall be mailed by the village manager,
or his/her designated representatives, to the owner and occupant of the real
estate whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after it has
been rendered. The failure of the village manager, or his/her designated
representatives, to record such lien claim or to mail such notice or the
failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to
foreclose the lien for unpaid bills for removal activities as provided herein.
This lien upon the real estate is superior to all other liens and encumbrances,
except tax liens and as otherwise provided by state law; provided that notice
has been given as herein described, and further provided that within one year
after such removal costs are incurred the village, or person performing the
service by authority of the village, in his/her or its own name, files notice
of lien in the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook County. The notice shall
consist of a sworn statement setting out: 1) a description of the real estate
sufficient for identification thereof, including the identification of the real
estate by common description; 2) a description of the removal activities; 3)
the amount of money representing the removal costs; 4) the date or dates when
such removal costs were incurred by the village; and 5) a statement that the
lien has been filed pursuant to applicable provisions of this code and the
provisions of 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7, 11-20-8(d), 11-20-12(d), 11-20-13(e), 11-20-

describe the removal activities. See 65 ILCS 11-20-7 and 11-20-15.
   (h)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the removal costs, the lien filing
fees and the release filing fees by the owner of or persons interested in such
real estate, after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by
the village or person in whose name the lien has been filed and the release may
be filed of record as in the case of filing the notice of lien. See 65 ILCS 5/
11-20-15(h) or 11-20-15.1(e).
   (i)   Trees partly on private real estate and partly on public real estate.
Dutch elm diseased trees and Emerald Ash borer infested trees, the trunks of
which, in the opinion of the village manager, or his/her designated
representative, are partly on village owned real estate and partly on privately
owned real estate, shall be removed by the village. The cost of such tree
removal shall be shared equally by the village and the owner of record of the
privately owned real estate. In the event that the owner of the privately owned
real estate, upon notice from the village, fails to pay one-half of said cost
within 30 days, then the village shall pay the entire cost of the tree removal
and shall have the right to collect from the owner one-half of the cost by lien
or suit for judgment. The cost shall be a lien upon the real estate, provided
that notice is given to the owner prior to 30 days before the tree removal and
a notice of lien is recorded in the recorder's office within 60 days after the
removal costs are incurred, as provided by 65 ILCS 5/11-20-12. For purposes of
this section, the village property line shall be deemed to be 33 feet from the
centerline of each street, except in those instances where a street may be more
than 66 fet in width, in which case the village engineer, or his/her designated
representative, shall determine the location of the property line. In the sole
discretion of the village manager, or his/her designated representative, the
village may agree to place the tree in a nationally recognized treatment
program overseen by a licensed arborist hired by the owner and approved by the
village arborist. The village and the private owner shall share equally the
costs of such treatment program.
   (j)   Village to remove its own trees. Unless the tree is placed in or is
being actively treated under a nationally recognized treatment program overseen
by the village arborist, infected trees on village owned real estate and on
public streets and highways within the corporate limits shall be removed at the
expense of the village.
   (k)   Abandoned residential property; removal; lien. For nuisance trees
removed from properties qualifying as abandoned under § 11-20-15.1 of the
Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-20-15.1), the village may impose liens in

Division 2. Tree Permit Procedures
§ 34-23 TREE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Any person that proposes to undertake any tree impact activity shall be
required to obtain a tree permit from the village arborist prior to the
approval or commencement of any tree impact activity. A tree permit is not
required for pruning, trimming or other similar tree maintenance activities.
(Ord. No. 2022-12-3532, § 2)
§ 34-24 TREE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (a)   Any applicant for a tree permit shall submit an application on a form
prescribed by the village arborist as well as a plan (the "priority tree plan")
that:
      (1)   Identifies all priority trees on the lot, parcel or tract,
including their location, size (in DBH), species and condition;
      (2)   Indicates the nature and extent of the tree impact activity that is
proposed to occur within or likely to interfere with the drip line of any
priority tree; and
      (3)   Sets forth in detail the measures to be undertaken to protect any
priority tree (but not any removable trees) on the lot, parcel or tract.
   (b)   The village arborist may allow the priority tree plan to be combined
with any other material that may be required in connection with the activity
giving rise to the tree permit requirement. In addition, the village arborist
may require an applicant to submit such supplemental information that may
reasonably be necessary to conduct a complete review of the application
pursuant to this article.
§ 34-25 REVIEW OF TREE PERMIT APPLICATIONS; ISSUANCE OF TREE PERMITS.
   (a)   The village arborist shall review each priority tree plan to
determine:
      (1)   Whether such plan will likely result in the cutting or destruction
of any priority tree;
      (2)   Whether such plan minimizes the destruction to or cutting of
priority trees; and
      (3)   Whether such plan provides adequate protection of each priority
tree.
   (b)   If the village arborist determines that a priority tree plan will
neither destroy nor cut any priority tree and will provide adequate protection
of all priority trees, then the arborist shall issue a tree permit, and the
applicant shall be entitled to proceed with the tree impact activity, subject
to satisfaction of any other permitting or other requirements of law relating
to such activity.
   (c)   If the village arborist determines that a priority tree plan will
likely result in the cutting or destruction of any priority tree, the arborist
shall first consult with the applicant to modify the tree impact activity or to
take other or additional action to avoid or minimize such cutting or
destruction. If such consultation results in modifications or additional
actions that avoid or minimize the cutting or destruction of priority trees,
the village arborist shall issue a tree permit, and the applicant shall be
entitled to proceed with the tree impact activity, subject to satisfaction of
any other permitting or other requirements of law relating to such activity.
   (d)   If the village arborist determines that a priority tree plan will
likely result in the cutting or destruction of any priority tree, and the
arborist's consultation with the applicant does not result in modifications or
additional actions that avoid or minimize the cutting or destruction of
priority trees, then:
      (1)   Priority I trees. For each priority I tree, the village arborist
shall determine whether the cutting or destruction of the priority I tree can
be avoided by a reasonable modification to the tree impact activity. If so, the
village arborist shall issue the tree permit subject to such modifications. If
the village arborist determines that no such modification will avoid the
cutting or destruction of the priority I tree, and that absent such cutting or
destruction of a priority I tree the applicant cannot make reasonable use of
the applicant's lot, parcel or tract, then the applicant shall receive a tree
permit subject to satisfying the tree replacement condition prescribed in the
tree permit;
      (2)   Priority II trees. No priority II tree shall be cut or destroyed
unless the applicant demonstrates that such cutting or destruction is necessary
to accomplish the tree impact activity (other than the cutting or destruction
of a priority tree), and no reasonable alternatives exist to effect the tree
impact activity without such cutting or destruction. Upon demonstrating the
necessity of such cutting or destruction, the applicant shall receive a tree
permit, subject to satisfying the tree replacement condition prescribed in the
tree permit; and
      (3)   Priority III trees. If the cutting or destruction of a priority III
tree is desired, the applicant shall receive a tree permit, subject to
satisfying the tree replacement condition prescribed in the tree permit.
   (e)   When issuing a tree permit, the village arborist may establish such
conditions as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this
article, including without limitation the installation of fencing to protect
the drip line of any priority tree. Any applicant receiving a tree permit shall
be required to comply strictly with the terms and conditions of such tree
permit, including the priority tree plan, at the applicant's sole cost and
expense.
   (f)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, to the
extent a tree permit is sought for a removable tree, the village arborist shall
issue the tree permit without any tree replacement obligation.
   (g)   Topping prohibited. It is recognized that topping immediately injures
the tree, exposes a tree to decay, and permits invasion from insects and
disease. In addition, the loss of foliage starves the tree, weakening the
roots, and reducing the tree's structural strength.
(Ord. No. 2022-12-3532, § 2)
§ 34-26 TREE REPLACEMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Whenever a tree permit is subject to a tree replacement obligation due
to the cutting or destruction of a priority tree, the village arborist shall
determine what the tree replacement obligation shall be, which obligation shall
be based on the type of priority tree affected and subject to the following
terms.
      (1)   Priority I trees.
         A.   If the affected priority I tree has a DBH of four and one-half
inches or less, the village arborist may require the applicant to relocate such
tree elsewhere on the parkway serving applicant's lot, parcel or tract.
         B.   If the affected priority I tree has a DBH in excess of four and
one-half inches or the village arborist determines that relocation is not
desirable or feasible, the village arborist may require the applicant to pay a
tree replacement fee to the village for the installation of a replacement tree
on any parkway or right-of-way in the village. The village manager shall
establish a reasonable tree replacement fee on an annual basis, based on the
village's cost per inch of a tree with a DBH of three inches. The required tree
replacement fee shall then be calculated by multiplying the DBH inches of the
priority tree that is removed times the tree replacement fee established by the
village manager, except that the tree replacement fee is doubled if the removed
priority tree is a heritage tree that has a DBH of eight inches or more.
(Ord. No. 2005-11-3131; Ord. No. 2009-11-3244)
      (2)   Priority II and III trees.
         A.   The village arborist may require the applicant to install a
replacement tree(s) at a specific location on the applicant's lot, parcel or
tract; provided, however, that no replacement tree(s) shall be installed within
25 feet of any existing tree.
         B.   If the applicant's lot, parcel or tract does not have a suitable
location to install a replacement tree(s), the village arborist may require the
applicant to pay a tree replacement fee to the village for installation upon
the parkway within the same or adjacent block as the applicant's lot, parcel or
tract. The village manager shall establish a reasonable tree replacement fee on
an annual basis, based on the village's cost per inch of a tree with a DBH of
three inches. The required tree replacement fee shall then be calculated by
multiplying the DBH inches of the priority tree that is removed times the tree
replacement fee established by the village manager, except that the tree
replacement fee is doubled if the removed priority tree is a heritage tree that
has a DBH of eight inches or more.
(Ord. No.2005-11-3131; Ord. No. 2009-11-3244)
      (3)   Waiver. If the village arborist determines that:
         A.   There is no suitable location for installing a replacement tree
(s) on the applicant's lot, parcel or tract; and
         B.   The removal of the priority tree will enhance the conditions for
other trees on such lot, parcel or tract, the village arborist may waive the
requirement to provide for a replacement tree(s).
   (b)   Whenever the village arborist requires an applicant to install a
replacement tree on the applicant's lot, parcel or tract as a condition of a
tree permit, such replacement tree shall have a caliper of no less than three
inches. The village arborist may prescribe the species of replacement tree,
provided that such species is one of the species authorized for installation
pursuant to the village's parkway tree program. In addition, an applicant shall
be required to replace any replacement tree that does not survive the second
anniversary of its installation. If a heritage tree is removed and replaced
with a heritage tree(s), the replacement tree(s) must measure one caliper inch
for each DBH inch of the removed heritage tree. If a heritage tree is removed
and replaced with a tree(s) that is not a heritage tree(s), the replacement
tree must measure two caliper inches for each DBH inch of the removed heritage
tree.
(Ord. No. 2000-10-2092; Ord. No. 2009-11-3244)
Division 3. Administration and Enforcement
§ 34-27 APPLICATION FORMS, FEES AND INCIDENTAL RULES; APPEALS.
   (a)   The village manager is hereby authorized to establish any incidental
rules or regulations that may be necessary to implement the provisions of this
article, including the preparation of application, permit or other forms. There
shall be no fee charged in connection with the issuance of or application for a
tree permit.
   (b)   In the event that an applicant objects to a determination of the
village arborist in connection with a tree permit or tree permit application
under this article, an applicant may appeal such determination of the village
arborist by filing a written appeal with the village manager within ten days
after the arborist's determination. The appeal shall set forth with
particularity the aspect or aspects of the arborist's determination from which
the appeal is sought and the basis on which the applicant believes the
arborist's determination was inconsistent with the standards of this article.
The village manager shall, after reviewing such written appeal and making such
investigations as the manager deems necessary or appropriate, render a written
decision on the appeal, which decision shall either affirm, reverse or modify
the determination of the village arborist. The decision of the village manager
shall be final.
§ 34-28 PLAN ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   The village shall have the authority to stop any tree impact activity
unless a tree permit has been issued therefor. Also, any tree impact activity
that is not undertaken in strict conformity with the terms and conditions of a
tree permit shall be subject to a stop work order until full compliance with
such plan has been achieved, in addition to other penalties authorized in this
article.
   (b)   (1)   Upon determination by the village manager that a tree impact
activity has been undertaken in a manner inconsistent with the terms of a tree
permit or a priority tree plan, the village manager may require that a security
deposit be filed with the village to secure the costs of removal and
replacement of any priority tree that is or becomes damaged or fails to
survive.
      (2)   The amount of the security deposit shall be determined by
calculating:
         A.   The value of the priority tree, based on the tree replacement fee
formula set forth in §
34-26 of this code; and
         B.   The cost of removing the dead or damaged priority tree from the
lot.
      (3)   The security deposit shall be in a form acceptable to the village
manager, and shall be valid for a period of two years from the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.
      (4)   The village manager may draw from the security deposit where the
village manager has determined that a priority tree has been damaged or failed
to survive as a result of the tree impact activity.
      (5)   The security deposit may be used for the costs of removing the
damaged or dead priority tree and replacing the priority tree.
(Ord. No. 2005-11-3131)
§ 34-29 PENALTY.
   (a)   (1)   The cutting, topping or destruction of any priority tree without
a tree permit shall:
         A.   Result in a fine as set forth in the village’s Comprehensive Fee
and Fine Schedule for each priority tree cut, topped or destroyed; and
         B.   Require immediate compliance with this article, including without
limitation application for and issuance of a tree permit pursuant to §§
34-23 through
34-25 of this code and installation of replacement trees or payment of the tree
replacement fee pursuant to §
34-26 of this code.
      (2)   The cutting, topping or destruction of each priority tree shall be
a separate violation, and each day that such violation continues and compliance
with this article has not been met shall be a separate violation.
(Ord. No. 2005-11-3131; Ord. No. 2016-04-3394; Ord. No. 2022-12-3532, § 2)
   (b)   Any other violation of this article shall result in a fine as set
forth in the village’s Comprehensive Fee and Fine Schedule for each offense.
Each day that a condition continues in violation of the provisions of this
article shall be deemed a separate offense.
(Ord. No. 2014-05-3357; Ord. No. 2016-04-3394)
   (c)   In the event that any person undertakes any cutting or destruction of
a priority tree without a permit due to emergency circumstances, the village
arborist shall have the authority to waive any penalty or to issue a tree
permit after the fact of such cutting or destruction.

description of the subject premises, the amount and due date of the unpaid bill

sending such notice, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice, shall
not affect the right to foreclose for lien as provided in the following
section, or the right of the village to pursue any other rights or remedies it
may have available to it.

the village attorney shall, upon direction of the village manager, institute
proceedings in the name of the village to foreclose any lien claims filed by
the village pursuant to §
34A-9. Such proceedings shall be in accordance with any specifically applicable
state statutes or, if none exist, in accordance with the procedures generally
applicable to the foreclosure of statutory liens. The proceeds of the sale
shall be applied to pay the bills, charges, fees or other debt which gave rise
to the lien, after deducting costs, as in the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens.
§ 34A-11 USE OF COLLECTION SERVICES.
   In addition or as an alternative to imposition of lien, as provided for in §
34A-9, the village clerk or the clerk’s designee may use a professional

delivers the electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of
the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and
is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as the original charge
for delivering the electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to §
35A-2(b) and any such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall
constitute a debt owed to the village by such person delivering the
electricity. With respect to such debt owed to the village, the person
delivering electricity shall be allowed a credit against such debt to the
extent the tax related to deliveries of electricity is not collected because
the charges for such electricity are written off as uncollectible; provided
that if such charges are thereafter collected by the person delivering
electricity, such person shall be obligated to remit such tax to the village.
Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by
adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons
delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to such gross charge an
amount equal to 3% of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity
for the expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and
filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon
request. If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the
purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
village in the manner prescribed by the village. The person delivering
electricity who files returns pursuant to this section shall, at the time of
filing such return, pay the village the amount of the tax to be collected
pursuant to §
35A-2(b).
(Ord. No. 98-16-2059)
   (b)   Monthly returns. Every collector of the tax imposed by §
35A-2(b) of this article shall file, on a monthly basis, a return in a form
prescribed by the village treasurer. The return and accompanying remittance
shall be due on or before the last day of the month following the month during
which the tax is collected or is required to be collected under this article.
   (c)   Returns to be filed.
      (1)   On or before the last day of each month, each taxpayer who has not
paid the tax imposed by §
35A-2(b) to a person delivering electricity as set forth in this article and
who is not otherwise exempted from paying such tax shall make a return to the
village treasurer for the preceding month, stating:
         A.   Taxpayer's name;
         B.   Taxpayer's principal place of business;
         C.   Taxpayer's kilowatt-hour usage during the month upon the basis of
which the tax is imposed;
         D.   Amount of tax; and
         E.   Such other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.
      (2)   The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the
time of making such return, pay to the village the amount of tax herein
imposed.
   (d)   Books and records. Every person delivering electricity to a purchaser
and every taxpayer required to pay the tax imposed by §
35A-2(b) directly to the village shall keep accurate books and records of its
business or activity, including contemporaneous books and records denoting the
transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability under
this section. Subject to the applicable provisions of §
35A-39 of this code, the books and records shall be subject to and available
for inspection by the village at all times during the business hours of the
day.
(Ord. No. 98-10-2053; Ord. No. 2000-34-3016)
§ 35A-6 PAYMENTS IN ERROR.
   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid that was not due
under the provisions of this article, whether as the result of a mistake of
fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due
or to become due under this article from the taxpayer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, that no amounts erroneously paid more than three years prior
to the filing of a claim therefore shall be so credited.
(Ord. No. 92-28-1894; Ord. No. 2000-34-3016)
§ 35A-7 PENALTY.
   Any taxpayer who makes a late return or payment, who fails to make a return,
who makes a fraudulent return, or who willfully violates any other provision of
this chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in §
35A-47 of this code.

or her sound judgment, that the failure to file a return was due to reasonable
cause and abate some or all of the penalty.

with the provisions of a village tax is a result of willful or fraudulent
disregard of the village tax laws, such taxpayer shall be additionally subject
to the general penalty provisions of this municipal code (including any
criminal penalties) and, in addition, shall be liable in a civil action for the
full amount of the tax due plus the applicable amount of interest.

Official Comprehensive Plan; and
      2.   Establish a rational pattern of land uses and encourage the most
appropriate use of individual parcels of land in the Village; and

scale and character of existing development from the encroachment of
incompatible uses and structures having excessive bulk or providing inadequate
open space; and

land use in the Village; and
      5.   Provide for the gradual elimination of non-conforming uses that
adversely affect the character and value of permitted development; and

aesthetic amenities, and natural features; and

environment, and convenience of access to property; and
      8.   Promote and protect the public health, safety, morals, and the
general welfare of the Village.
   C.   Public Infrastructure. The purposes of this Code related to public
infrastructure are to:
      1.   Facilitate the most efficient use of existing and planned public
facilities and utilities; and
      2.   Protect existing public facilities and utilities from being
overloaded due to excess development or development incompatible with the
capabilities of the Village's utility systems; and
      3.   Protect and enhance a pattern of interconnected streets and highways
that is unified, integrated, safe, effective, and efficient; and
      4.   Reduce congestion and promote safety on streets and highways by
limiting traffic generation through the control of land use intensity; and

ARTICLE II
ZONING DISTRICTS AND OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
2-101 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
   To carry out the purposes of this Code, the Village is hereby divided into
the following zoning districts:
   A.   Residential Districts -- Single Family and Multiple Family (Article
III)
      R-A - Single Family Residential District
      R-B - Single Family Residential District
      R-C - Single Family Residential District
      R-D - Single/Multiple Family Residential District
   B.   Business Districts (Article IV)
      B-1 - Central Business District
      B-2 - Neighborhood Business District
2-102 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT SEQUENCE
   A.   General Rule. This Code rejects as outdated and inappropriate the
concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and, except as noted
below, is based on the concept that each district should be designed to
accomplish a specific purpose, to encourage a particular type of development,
and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible
types of development.
   B.   Special Rule. Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is
recognized that when different districts are juxtaposed, their differing
characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that
might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this Code recognizes the
concept of "more restrictive" and "less restrictive" districts. For this
purpose, the districts established by this Code shall be considered "more
restrictive" or "less restrictive" in accordance with the following rules:
      1.   The residential districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive
than any non-residential districts.
      2.   The single family residential districts shall be deemed to be more
restrictive than the R-D single/multiple family residential district.
      3.   The B-1 District shall be deemed to be a more restrictive business
district than the B-2 District.
2-103 ANNEXED LAND
   A.   Annexation of Land. All land annexed to the Village after the effective
date of this Code shall be classified automatically upon such annexation in the
R-A Single Family Residential District. The owner of any land proposed to be
annexed to the Village shall file, with the petition for annexation, an
application for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance pursuant to Section
7-301 of this Code. In the case of an involuntary annexation, the Village
Manager shall complete the required application.
   B.   Application for Different Classification. When any land is classified
pursuant to this Section, it shall remain so classified unless and until an
application to amend such classification is filed and granted pursuant to
Section
7-501 of this Code. Such application may be filed prior to or contemporaneously
with the annexation of the land in question.
2-104 ZONING MAP
   A.   Map Incorporated. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts
established by this Code are as shown on a map entitled "Zoning Map of the
Village of Glencoe, Illinois," hereafter referred to as the Zoning Map, which
is by this reference incorporated as part of this Code. All notations,
references, and other information shown on the Zoning Map, and all amendments
thereto, shall be as much a part of this Code as if specifically set forth and
literally described herein.
   B.   Omitted Land. It is the intent of this Code that the entire area of the
Village, including all land and water areas, be included in the districts
established by this Code. Any area lying within the Village but not shown on
the Zoning Map as being included in such a district shall be deemed to be, and
it is hereby, classified in the R-A Single Family Residential District.
   C.   District Boundaries. In the event that any uncertainty exists with
respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
      1.   The district boundaries are the center lines of expressways,
highways, streets, alleys, waterways, railroads, and other rights-of-way unless
otherwise indicated. When the designation of a boundary line on the Zoning Map
coincides with the location of any such right-of-way, the center line of such
right-of-way shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
      2.   When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot line, such lot line
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
      3.   When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way or lot line, the district boundary shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
   D.   Maintenance and Availability of Official Zoning Map. The official copy
of the Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Village Manager and shall be
available for public inspection during Village business hours at the Village
Hall. Any amendment to zoning district boundaries or any change in any other
information shown on the Zoning Map made by amendment to this Code shall be
indicated on the official copy of the Zoning Map.
   E.   Mapping of Parcels Affected by Court Decrees. Parcels of land affected
by court decrees shall be shown on the Zoning Map in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection
8-106B of this Code.
ARTICLE III
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS - SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTIPLE FAMILY
3-101 PURPOSES
   Four zoning districts are provided for residential development. Of these,
three districts are provided for single family residential development, while
one district is provided for both single and multiple family residential
developments.
   The single family districts provide for a limited range of housing densities
consistent with the Village's established residential neighborhoods. The R-
A District allows for lower density residential use and larger lot sizes. The
R-B and R-C Districts allow for somewhat higher density residential use and
smaller lot sizes.
   The R-D District permits single family residential developments and permits
as a special use higher density residential building types consistent with
existing development patterns. (Amended 6/2003)
   The single family district regulations are intended to preserve established
neighborhoods and encourage new residential development consistent with the
overall character of the Village. The multiple family district regulations are
designed to encourage a moderate density residential area including alternate
housing types in a suburban residential environment.
3-102 PERMITTED USES
   The following uses and no others are permitted as of right in residential
districts.

This provision shall not apply to municipal uses that serve as parking lots.
(Amended 6/2003)
   D.   Housing for Senior Citizens and Handicapped Persons (but only in the R-

parking lot to serve the religious congregation; provided, however, that (i)
such parking spaces, parking area, or parking lot does not create any
violations of any other provisions of this Code on either the lot used for a
religious congregation or on the host lot; (ii) an easement satisfactory to the
Village Attorney is recorded to establish the rights for such parking spaces,
parking area, or parking lot and access thereto from a street; (iii) the
parking spaces, parking area, or parking lot on the host lot shall abut the lot
used for a religious congregation, and (iv) any relief from the provisions of
Paragraph 5-104B2 or Subsection

pre-existing antenna support structure, or (2) for a proposed tower, that no
lawfully pre-existing building or structure is available, on commercially
reasonably terms, and sufficient for the location of an antenna necessary for

is not part of the authorized principal use of a religious congregation or an
authorized accessory or temporary use, provided that such use can be reasonably
accommodated by the religious congregation without causing undue disruption to
neighboring properties and otherwise meets the standards for a special use
permit and the requirements of the Village Code and other applicable law.
(Amended 8/2004)
   J.   Relief for any building or structure devoted to a Village use that does
not meet the bulk, space, and yard requirements contained in Section

      6.   Platted Building Lines. See Subsection
8-101F of this Code.
      7.   Front and Corner Side Yard Adjustments.
         (a)   Where one-third or more of the frontage of a block in any R-A,
R-B, or R-C District consists of the linear frontage of lots utilized for
existing principal buildings, the front yard shall be established at the
average distance of such existing principal buildings from the  street line;
provided that in no case shall the front of a building be required to set back
more than 10 feet deeper than the front of an existing principal building on an
immediately  adjacent lot, nor more than 50 feet from the street line in any
case. (Amended 6/2003)
         (b)   If the rear lot line of a corner lot forms part or all of the
side lot line of an adjacent lot, then the minimum corner side yard of the
corner lot shall be 25 feet, except to the extent that, pursuant to
Subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this Paragraph 3-111G7, a special setback is
established. The corner side yard need not exceed the front yard herein
established for adjoining lots fronting on the side street.
         (c)   Where a district boundary line separates districts with
different setback requirements, a special building line shall be established in
the district of lesser setback requirement, located by connecting the following
points by a straight line: (i) a point on the established building line of the
district of lesser setback requirement, at a distance from the district
boundary line equivalent to the difference in the setback requirements of the
two districts, but this distance need not exceed 20 feet, and (ii) the point of
intersection of the building line of the district of greater setback
requirement, and the district boundary line.
         (d)   Where the setback requirements of this Code differ from two
adjoining lots, or where the side yard of one lot is less than the front yard
required along the same street for an adjoining lot, the side lot line of the
second  lot being formed partially or wholly by the rear lot line of the first
mentioned lot, the building line for the lot on which the deeper  setback is
required shall be modified for a distance of not more than 60 feet from the lot
line of the adjoining lot, to lie halfway between the lesser and greater of the
two required building lines.
         (e)   In the case of a lot that does not have a front lot line equal
to at least 50 feet, the front yard line shall be established by the Board of
Trustees so as to conform as closely as practicable to the intent and purpose
of this Code to require uniform setbacks and appropriate spacing between
buildings. Such front yard line shall be marked on the plat for any lot
hereafter divided and shall be established prior to the issuance of a building
permit for all other lots.
      8.   Exceptions in Yard Regulations.

court.
         (b)   Accessory Buildings. No accessory building shall hereafter be
erected, altered, or maintained at a distance less than five feet from the rear
lot line; provided that, wherever the rear lot line of a corner lot forms part
of the front half of the side lot line of an adjacent  lot, no accessory
building shall, on said first mentioned lot, (i) be placed nearer to the rear
lot line of such lot than a dimension equal to the side yard requirement of the
adjoining lot, unless such accessory building is placed 50 feet or more from
the street line; or (ii) be placed nearer to the corner side line of said lot
than a dimension equal to the front yard requirement of the adjoining lot,
unless such accessory building is placed 25 feet or more from the rear lot
line.
         (c)   R-D District. For single family residential developments in the
R-D District, the total required side yards need not exceed 25 feet, and the
required rear yard need not exceed 25 feet.
      9.   Attached Garages. Any garage that is attached to a single family
dwelling shall be considered a part of the single family dwelling for purposes
of compliance with this Code but may extend into the required rear yard to
within five feet of the rear lot line; provided that such garage, together with
all detached accessory structures located within such rear yard, shall not
occupy more than 650 square feet of such required rear yard in the R-A District
or 550 square feet of such required rear yard in the R-B, R-C, and R-
D Districts. No such structure shall be used, maintained, or converted for any
use or purpose other than a garage, nor shall such structure have attic space
with a clear ceiling height of seven feet or greater at any point.
      10.   Courts. The following regulations shall apply to outer and inner
courts in the R-D District:

multiple family dwelling hereafter erected, constructed, or created in any
residential district shall have a gross floor area of less than 600 square feet
if an efficiency dwelling unit; 800 square feet if a one-bedroom dwelling unit;
or 800 square feet plus an additional 150 square feet for every bedroom in
excess of the first bedroom if a two or more bedroom dwelling unit.
      12.   Maximum Gross Floor Area. For purposes of calculating a lot's
maximum gross floor area, the following shall be excluded:
         (a)   The first 400 square feet of any detached garage; (17 August
2000)
         (b)   The first 200 square feet of any attached garage located in the
rear half of the lot, but not for any garage along a corner building front, and
not on any lot for which Subparagraph 3-111G12(a) also applies; (17 August
2000)
         (c)   That portion of a porch along a building front up to eight feet
in depth;
         (d)   The first 150 square feet of unfinished attic space having a
clear ceiling height of at least seven feet, provided that such attic is not
accessible via a fixed, permanent stairway;
         (e)   The first 64 square feet of underbay or undereave areas that
project not more than four feet from an exterior wall of a building; and
         (f)   That portion of a courtyard that is uninterrupted by walls as
measured perpendicularly from either the front yard line or the corner side
yard line.

on the lot.
         (c)   For lots having a lot width of 80 feet or less, no portion of a
building on any such lot [except as provided in subparagraph (d) below] shall
intercept any plane that begins at points directly above grade at a side lot
line at a height determined by the following formula:
   Height (in feet) of beginning points for setback plane = 8 + [0.15 (80 - W)]
where "W" is the lot width of the lot in question, and runs at a 45 degree
angle toward the interior of such lot until it reaches the maximum building
height permitted on the lot.

is measured; (b) no single dormer extending beyond a setback plane shall have a
length in excess of 12 feet at its intersection with the setback plane; and (c)
no dormer shall extend beyond the setback plane at any point closer than ten
feet from the intersection of the building front and the side of the building
from which the setback plane is measured.
         (iii)   Chimneys, roof-mounted antennae, and other similar
architectural features and appurtenances not otherwise considered in
determining building height may extend through the setback plane.
         (iv)   Gable roof ends, hip roof ends, and gambrel roof ends (as
depicted in Illustrations A, B, and C to this Code, respectively) may extend
into and through the setback plane, provided that: (a) the total length of such
roof end extensions at their intersection with a setback plane shall not exceed

increased to 30 feet at the rate of one inch in length for each increase of
three inches in the lot width; and (b) no dormer may project from any roof end
extending through the setback plane.
      15.   Allowable Gross Floor Area for Lots With 8,000 Square Feet.

not less than three (3) feet from such interior side lot line;
         (ii)   For lots having a lot width of more than 40 feet but less than
80 feet, to a distance of not less than four (4) feet from such interior side
lot line;
         (b)   To the extent that a detached garage is located in accordance
with a reduced interior side lot line setback authorized under Subparagraph
3-111G20(a), such garage shall not be considered in determining compliance with
the minimum total side yard requirement for such lot.

ARTICLE IV
BUSINESS DISTRICTS
4-101 PURPOSES
   Two zoning districts are provided for business and commercial uses. When
taken together, these districts are intended to permit development of property
for the full range of business and commercial uses needed to serve the citizens
of Glencoe and nearby suburban areas.
   The business districts are intended to serve the everyday shopping needs of
Village residents as well as to provide opportunities for specialty shops
attractive to the wider suburban residential community around the Village. They
permit uses that are necessary to satisfy the most basic and frequently
occurring shopping needs. They also permit compatible uses that, while not used
as frequently, would be desirably located in close proximity to potential
users. The districts are normally located on primary or secondary
thoroughfares, are relatively small in size, and have bulk standards that
provide for compatibility with nearby residential uses. Business uses are to be
limited to retail and service establishments dealing directly with customers.
   The B-1 Central Business District is located in the center of the Village.
It is intended to be a contiguous area serving the entire Glencoe suburban
community with a wide variety of retail and service uses. The bulk standards
are intended to reflect the generally more intense development of property
existing in this area.
   The B-2 Neighborhood Shopping District is located at the south end of the
Village and is functionally a part of the Hubbard Woods commercial area that is
partially located in Winnetka. The regulations are designed to encourage a
broad range of attractive retail and compatible service uses, and the bulk
standard are intended to reflect the development of a contiguous business area
consisting primarily of property fronting on one of the major thoroughfares in
the Village.

ARTICLE IV-A
HIGHWAY FRONTAGE DISTRICT
(Adopted July 2000)
4A-101 PURPOSES
   The Highway Frontage (HF) District addresses the special circumstances
affecting a unique and isolated corridor of land lying west of the Edens
Expressway in the Village. The District is intended to accommodate certain
public open spaces within the Village as well as public buildings and uses, as
well as other uses identified below. Because the property within the Highway
Frontage District is remote from other property in the Village, it creates
particular challenges to the Village with respect to utility and public
services for development and use of the property. Thus, the most appropriate
uses on the property in this district are open space and municipal uses. In
addition, under certain limited circumstances, motor vehicle dealerships may
also be permitted, subject to specific restrictions and conditions. No other
use shall be permitted as of right; however, certain office uses may be
permitted pursuant to a special use permit, recognizing that the special use
permit process permits a careful review of the type of use proposed, the impact
of such use on the Highway Frontage District, neighboring properties, and the
Village as a whole, and the capability of the Village to serve such uses,
whether directly or indirectly.
4A-102 PERMITTED USES
   The uses indicated in the following table, and no others, are permitted as
of right in the Highway Frontage District. In interpreting the use
designations, reference should be made to the standards in Section
7-401E of this Code. Where applicable, SIC codes are given in parentheses for
reference only in applying interpretive standards.
   A.   Open Space.
   B.   Municipal Buildings and Uses.
   C.   Motor Vehicle Dealers (5510.02)
4A-103  SPECIAL USES
   A.    Business, Professional, and Administrative Offices.
   B.    Buildings and structures devoted to a Village use that do not meet the
bulk, space, and yard requirements contained in Section
4A-110 of this Code, subject to such restrictions and conditions on the special
use permit as the Board of Trustees may deem necessary or appropriate. (2/2009)
   C.    Golf Course Protective Structure. With the approval of a Special Use
Permit, such structures are not subject to otherwise applicable height,
setback, or setback plane Zoning Code requirements.
(Am. Ord. 2023-23-3568, passed 10-19-2023)

building permit and affecting the exterior appearance of any structure shall be
permitted in the Highway Frontage District except upon appearance review
approval pursuant to Section
7-503 of this Code and upon approval of the building permit application
pursuant to the Glencoe Village Code.
   B.   Exterior Lighting. All exterior lighting in the Highway Frontage
District shall be so arranged as to prevent direct glare of beams unto any
residential district by the use of luminare cutoffs.
   C.   Noise. No noise from any operations of any use in the Highway Frontage
District shall be detectable at any point off the zoning lot on which the use

discontinue such use upon the expiration of such time; and
      2.   Does not involve the construction or alteration of any permanent
structure.
   C.   Certificate of Zoning Compliance Required: Special Standards for
Issuance and Revocation.
      1.   Certificate Required. Except as provided in Paragraph D1 of this

certificate of zoning compliance evidencing the compliance of such use with the
provisions of this Code shall have first been issued in accordance with Section
7-301 of this Code.
      2.   Bases for Certificate Denial. A certificate of zoning compliance may
be denied if the Village Manager determines that the applicant has failed to
comply with the terms or conditions of any previ-ously issued zoning
certificate for a temporary use or that the permanent use of the subject prop-
erty fails to comply in all respects with the provisions of all Village
ordinances regulating the development, use, and maintenance of the property.
Such a certificate shall be denied if the Village Manager determines that the
public health, safety, or welfare would be, or may reasonably be expected to
be, impaired by the issuance thereof.

access and the absence of undue adverse impact on other properties. No such
sale shall exceed a period of three days.
      3.   Contractors' Offices, Portable Toilets, and Equipment Sheds: In any
district when accessory to a construction project. No such use shall contain
any sleeping or cooking accommodations. Such use shall be limited to a period

provisions, available utilities, and traffic access, as well as the absence of
undue adverse impacts on other properties; provided further that no such use
shall be permitted unless the Village Manager also finds that such use will
contribute directly to the preservation and enhancement of an attractive and
active business district. Such uses shall not be permitted at any location more
than once in any seven day period or for more than eight consecutive hours;
provided, however, that a single certificate of zoning compliance per calendar
year may be issued for a recurring open air market. Unless waived in writing by
the Village Manager, open air markets shall comply with the applicable
district bulk, space, and yard requirements of this Code.
      7.   Outdoor Storage of Construction Materials. In any district when
accessory to a construction project on the lot for which a valid building

vehicular traffic reasonably expected to be gener-ated by such temporary use
would have undue detrimental effects on surrounding streets and uses.
      5.   Conflicts with Other Temporary Uses. No temporary use shall be
permitted if such use would conflict with another previously authorized
temporary use.
      6.   Parking. Before approving any temporary use, the Village Manager
shall make an assessment of the total number of off-street parking spaces that
will be reasonably required in connection with the proposed temporary use, on
the basis of the particular use, its intensity, and the availability of other
parking facilities in the area, and shall approve such temporary use only if
such off-street parking is provided. No temporary use shall be authorized that
would, in the opinion of the Village Manager, unreasonably reduce the amount of
off-street parking spaces available for use in connection with permanent uses
located on the zoning lot in question.

Section
5-105 of this Code, signs shall be located only on the same zoning lot as the

spaces may only be allowed when such lot across a street or alley is covenanted
to remain as parking for so long as said parking spaces are required to meet
the standards of this Code.
         (c)   Deficiency Spaces. When proposed to eliminate a parking
deficiency, or when required because of a change in use or an increase in use
intensity pursuant to Subparagraphs B1(b) or (c) of this Section, parking
spaces may be located within any district (subject to the requirements of that
district) that is adjacent to the district in which the principal use in
question is a permitted use, or within the same zoning district as, and within
1,000 feet of, the zoning lot on which the use to be served is located;
provided, however, that such remote parking spaces may be allowed only when
such remote site is covenanted to remain as parking for so long as said parking
spaces are required to meet the standards of this Code.
   C.   Design and Maintenance. Every parking lot and garage shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards and requirements
herein set forth:
      1.   Location on Lot. Off-street parking spaces may be provided on
surface lots, underground, under a building, or in parking structures. Parking
lots, areas, and garages shall comply with the yard requirements made
applicable to them by the regulations of the district in which they are
located. See Paragraph
5-101D4 for additional regulations concerning the off-street storage of
vehicles in residential districts.
      2.   Screening and Landscaping. All parking lots and garages shall comply
with the screening and landscaping requirements set forth in Section
5-106 of this Code.
      3.   Design.
         (a)   Access to Street.
            (i)   Least Interference. All parking lots, areas, and garages
shall be so located and designed as to provide access to adjacent streets with
the least interference with pedestrian and through traffic movements.
            (ii)   Driveways. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code,
driveways serving single family dwellings and driveways providing direct access
from a parking lot to a street (and not serving as a circulation aisle), may
traverse any required yard.
            (iii)   Curb Cut Width and Driveway Width. No curb cut across
public property shall exceed 26 feet in width without the written approval of
the Village Manager. In addition, no driveway shall exceed 16 feet in width at
the right-of-way line.
            (iv)   Access Across Separate Zoning Lot. No such access to an
adjacent street shall be provided through a zoning lot other than the zoning
lot on which the parking lot is located except across a permanent, recorded
access easement in form and sub-stance satisfactory to the Village Attorney.
            (v)   Business Districts. No parking space required for a building
in the B-1 or B-2 District shall hereafter be constructed unless the means of
access to and from such space is through an alley or street other than Vernon,
Park, or Glencoe Road, or is otherwise approved by the Village Manager.
         (b)   Turn-Around Area. Every parking lot or garage, other than a
parking lot or garage accessory to a single family dwelling, shall be provided
with a turn-around area or other means to permit cars to exit the parking lot
or garage without backing onto any street or sidewalk.
         (c)   Surface; Drainage; Markings. Every off-street parking lot and
garage shall be surfaced with a bituminous or Portland cement concrete
pavement, cement paver bricks, or a similar hard surface approved by the
Village Manager, providing an all-weather, durable, and dustless surface.
All parking surfaces shall be graded and drained to dispose of surface water
accumula-tion by means of a positive storm water drain-age system connected to
a public storm sewer system. Except for single family dwellings, individual
stalls shall be clearly identified by painted markings six inches in width.
         (d)   Lighting. Unless otherwise expressly approved by the Board of
Trustees, fixed lighting shall be provided for all parking lots and garages
accommodating more than 10 vehicles. Such lighting shall be so arranged as to
prevent direct glare of beams onto any adjacent public or private property or
streets by the use of luminare cutoffs. All lighting shall be reduced to
security levels at all times of non-use.
         (e)   Tree Planting Areas. Trees located within planting islands in
paved areas shall have a minimum landscaped area of at least 36 square feet of
surface area and be designed to permit adequate drainage.
         (f)   Car Stops. Every parking lot and garage, except parking lots and
garages accessory to a single family dwelling, shall be provided with curbs,
car wheel stops, guard rails, barrier fences, or other suitable devices
designed and located to protect required screening devices, landscaping, and
structures from damage by vehicles using such lot or garage. This pro-vision
shall not be construed to require car wheel stops for every parking space, but
only in those cases where the Village Manager determines that such stops are
necessary or desir-able to achieve the purposes of this Subparagraph.
         (g)   Circulation Aisles. Each parking space in a parking lot, except
spaces accessory to a single family dwelling, shall be accessed by a
circulation aisle of a width, in feet and inches, as specified below:

            90°         22'6"         24'0"
The above-stated aisle widths may be reduced if the Village Engineer determines
that such reduction will not adversely affect the safe and efficient use of
such parking spaces and such parking lot.
         (h)   Tandem Spaces. Unless otherwise expressly approved by the Board
of Trustees, no parking spaces shall be designed in "tandem" so that ingress to
or egress from one space is blocked by a second space, except for spaces
accessory to single family or multiple family dwellings.
         (i)   Back-up Area. Each parking space, except spaces accessory to a
single family dwelling, shall be provided with a sufficient back-up area to
permit egress in one maneuver, consist-ing of one backward and one forward
movement, and shall be designed so that no vehicle is required to back up onto
any street.

The above-stated stall width dimensions shall be increased to 16 feet for
required handicapped parking spaces or to the width required under applicable
State law, whichever is greater.
The above-stated stall dimensions may be reduced if the Village Engineer
determines that such reduction will not adversely affect the safe and efficient
use of such parking spaces.
         (k)   Maintenance. All tree planting areas, parking lots, garages, and
parking areas shall be properly maintained at all times so as to be free of pot
holes, broken curbs, and other damaged or neglected features.
         (l)   Board Approval. The arrangements, surfacing, screening, and
illumination of any open parking lot shall be subject to the approval of the
Board of Trustees.
   D.   Use. Except as otherwise set forth in this Code, no off-street parking

employees, the maximum number of employees working during the largest work
shift shall govern.

else contained in this Code to the contrary notwithstanding, no off-street
parking spaces, except such spaces as may be provided to accommodate the
reasonable needs of employees, shall be required, allowed, or provided in
connection with any eating place permitted in the B-1 or B-2 Districts unless
such eating place is located in a shopping center providing off-street parking
spaces in a parking lot designed and intended for the joint and common use of
all establishments in such shopping center and the parking spaces used or
provided for such eating place are located in such parking lot.
      5.    Spaces Reserved for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. Any space
meeting the requirements of this section reserved or designated for electric
vehicle charging stations may be counted toward satisfying minimum off-street

provided between any such ground-mounted antenna or antenna support structure
and each lot line of the property on which such antenna or antenna support
structure is located so as to provide the maximum reasonably achievable
screening, as determined by the Village Manager, of such antenna or antenna
support structure from ground level view from adjacent properties and public or
private streets. See Paragraphs
5-101D8 and
5-101D9 of this Code for additional requirements applicable to antennas and
antenna support structures.
   F.   Roof Top Mechanical Equipment. Except for antennas mounted on roofs
pursuant to the provisions of this Code, all mechanical equipment located on
the roof of any building (other than single family dwellings and their
accessory structures) constructed after the effective date of this Code shall
be screened by a parapet wall or other screening structure constructed of the
same materials as, or materials architecturally and aesthet-ically compatible
with, the principal building facade to the height of such equipment.
   G.   Fences and Walls. Fences and walls erected as permitted obstructions in
any required yard shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 9, Article XI
of the Village Code of Glencoe.
   H.   Screening and Landscaping Within Sight Triangles. Not-withstanding any
other provision of this Section, no landscaping, fencing, or other screening
shall be erected or maintained at a height in excess of two and one-half feet
within the areas described in Paragraph
3-111G3 and
4-110C2 of this Code.
   I.   Perimeter Landscaped Open Space. Except as expressly provided otherwise
in the regulations requiring a perimeter landscaped open space, such open space
shall extend along the entire length of the lot line in question and shall have
width equal to 10 feet or the depth of the yard required along the lot line in
question, whichever is greater. Perimeter landscaped open space shall be broken
only by permitted access drives. Such perimeter landscape open space shall be
suitably surfaced with grass, ground cover, or decorative paving material, or a
combination thereof; and shall contain landscaping such as ornamental trees and
shrubs or appropriate screening devices such as decorative walls, fences, or
berms, or a combination thereof. The landscaping and screening treatment of
such space shall be so designed and maintained as to preserve unobstructed
vision of the street and sidewalk at points of access and as not to interfere
with, or be damaged by, work within any public or utility easement unless the
Village Manager shall determine that no other location is reasonably feasible.
ARTICLE VI
NON-CONFORMITIES
6-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS
   A.   Purposes. This Article regulates and limits the continued existence of
uses, structures, lots, and signs established prior to the effective date of
this Code that do not conform to the applicable regulations of this Code. Any
legal nonconforming use, structure, lot, or sign existing at the time of the
passage of this Code may be maintained, repaired, restored, remodeled, or
altered, subject to the regulations in this Article.
   B.   General Scope and Scheme of Regulation. Separate restrictions are
established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of
structures, nonconforming structures, nonconforming lots of record, and
nonconforming signs. The degree of restriction made applicable to each category
of noncon-formity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with
permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with non-
conformities of that type.
   C.   Exception for Repairs Pursuant to Public Order. Nothing in this Article
shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition
of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged
with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe
and orders its restoration to a safe condition, provided such restoration is
not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this Article
prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or destroyed
structures or signs.
   D.   Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No use or structure that
is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after
such principal use or structure shall have been terminated, unless it shall
thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located.
   E.   Railroad or Railway Purposes. Any right-of-way, station grounds, or
other premises located in any district and now used for railroad or railway
purposes shall be considered a nonconforming use until such time as such
premises shall cease to be used for railroad or railway purposes, after which
the use of such premises shall, except as provided in Subsection
6-102G, conform with the provisions of this Code.
6-102 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND AND NONCONFORMING USES IN STRUCTURES
   A.   Authority to Continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this
Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use, whether or not it involves
the use of a  principal or accessory structure, may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Subsections B
through H of this Section and in Subsection D of Section
6-101 of this  Code.
   For purposes of this Section, any structure that is used in connection with
a nonconforming use of land and that has an assessed value of less than $5,000
on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto creating such
nonconformity shall be considered to be a structure accessory to a noncon-
forming use of land.
   B.   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of non-bearing walls,
non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any
structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that this
Subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Subsections C
through I of this Section.
   C.   Structural Alteration. A structure that is accessory to a nonconforming
use of land or that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use may
be structurally altered; provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be
deemed to authorize any violation of Subsection D through I of this Section;
and provided further that no such alteration shall create a new parking, bulk,
yard,  or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a
parking nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of
Paragraph 5-104B1 of this Code shall control.
   D.   Enlargement of Structure. No structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, including the
interior addition of floor area, unless the use of such  structure shall
thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is
located. No such  enlargement shall create any new parking, bulk, yard, or
space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking, bulk, yard,
or space nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a parking
nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of Paragraph 5-
104B1 of this Code shall control.
   E.   Extension of Use. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is
accessory to a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use in any other
structure shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity.
Such prohibited activity shall include, without limitation:
      1.   An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, to any
structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on
the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto that causes such use to
become nonconforming; and
      2.   An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a
building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not
occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code or any
amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming; and
      3.   An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal
hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto
that causes such use to become nonconforming.
   F.   Moving. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land
or that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in
whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall
thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in
whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
   G.   Change in Use. A nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or
involving only a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or
a nonconforming use in a structure shall not be changed to any  use other than
a use permitted in the zoning district in which the use or structure is
located; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may, after public notice
and hearing, authorize in any location an existing nonconforming use to be
replaced by another, different nonconforming use when such replacement use is
either by a public service corporation or for a public utility, civic, or
municipal purpose and is found by the  Board of Trustees to be reasonably
necessary for the public convenience and welfare. When such a nonconforming use
has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to
any non-permitted  use. For purposes of this Subsection, a use shall be deemed
to have been so changed when an existing nonconforming use shall have been
terminated and a permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a period
of five days. Any change of use in violation of this Subsection shall be deemed
to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing nonconforming use.
   H.   Damage or Destruction. Any structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent
of more than 50 percent of the cost of replacement of such  structure new shall
not be restored unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to
the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and unless
such restoration is accomplished without creating any new parking, bulk, yard,
or space nonconformity or increasing the degree of any parking, bulk, yard, or
space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or destruction; provided,
however, that such  structure may be restored if the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall grant a variation pursuant to Section
7-403 of this Code to permit such restoration and continued  nonconforming use.
In determining whether a parking non-conformity has been created or increased,
the provisions of Paragraph 5-104B1 of this Code shall control.
   When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent
of 50 percent or less of the cost of replacement of the structure new, repair
or restoration of such structure may be made and the nonconforming use may
continue subject to the regulations of this Section; provided, however, that no
repairs or restorations shall be made that would create any new parking, bulk,
yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any  parking, bulk,
yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or destruction, nor
shall any repairs or restoration except in conformity with the applicable
zoning district regulations be made unless a building permit is obtained and
restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial
damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
   I.   Termination by Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of land not
involving a structure or involving only a structure that is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land or when a nonconforming use of part or all of a
principal structure is discontinued for a period of one year, regardless of any
intent to resume or not to terminate such use, such use shall be deemed
abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent
use or occupancy of such land or  structure shall comply with the use
regulations of the  zoning district in which such land or structure is located.
   Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
non-conforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this Subsection.
6-103 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
   A.   Authority to Continue. Any nonconforming structure that is devoted to a
use that is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may be
maintained and replaced so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
restrictions in Subsections B through D of this Section and Subsection E of
Section
6-101 of this Code.
   B.   Repair, Maintenance, Alterations, Enlargement, and Replacement. Any
nonconforming structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, enlarged, or
rebuilt or replaced following demolition, damage, or destruction; provided,
however, that no such repair, maintenance,  alteration, enlargement, or
rebuilding or replacement shall either create any new parking, bulk, yard, or
space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking, bulk, yard,
or space nonconformity of all or any part of such structure as it existed on
the effective date of this Code, unless the Zoning Board of Appeals shall grant
a variation pursuant to Section
7-403 of this Code.
   In addition, no repair, rebuilding, or replacement following demolition,
damage, or destruction, shall be made except in conformity with the applicable
district regulations unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is obtained and
such repair, rebuilding, or replacement is actually begun within one year after
the date of such damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
   For purposes of this Subsection B and without limitation, the vertical
extension of a nonconforming structure shall be construed to increase the
degree of the existing nonconformity of the structure unless such vertical
extension conforms to all applicable parking, bulk, yard, and space regulations
of this Code, or unless such vertical extension consists solely of a chimney or
a modification to an existing roof line that does not result in any increase in
gross floor area having a clear ceiling height of seven feet or more. (See
January 2007 interpretation memo at end of Zoning Code.)
   C.   Authority to Continue Following Change in Use. Within the R-A, R-B, R-
C, and R-D Zoning Districts, the authority to replace a demolished, damaged, or
destroyed nonconforming structure set forth in this Section
6-103 above shall not apply when a nonconforming structure devoted to a use
other than single-family residential is willfully demolished, in whole or in
part, and is replaced with a structure devoted to a different use. When such a
nonconforming structure is willfully demolished in whole or in part, any
rebuilt or new structure or portion thereof may not continue any previously
exising non-conformities and must meet all current requirements of this Code,
unless a variation allowing the restoration of the nonconforming structure is
granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Section
7-403 of this Code.
   D.   Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part,
for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. (See January 2007
interpretation memo at end of Zoning Code.)
   E.   Damage or Destruction of Accessory Structure. Any nonconforming
accessory  structure that is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent
of more than 50 percent of the cost of replacement of such structure new shall
not be restored unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to
the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and unless
such restoration is accomplished in complete conformity with the parking, bulk,
yard, and space regulations of such existing district; provided, however, that
such  structure may be restored to its prior nonconforming condition if the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall grant a variation pursuant to Section
7-403 of this Code to permit such restoration.
(Am. Ord. 2025-11-3615, passed 4-17-2025)
6-104 LEGAL NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
   In any zoning district in which single family dwellings are a permitted use,
notwith-standing the regulations imposed by any other provisions of this
Article, a single family dwelling may be erected, and thereafter maintained,
repaired, restored, replaced, altered, and enlarged, on a  legal nonconforming
lot of record that has a width and area each equal to at least 80 percent of
the lot width and area required in the district in which such lot is located,
provided that such construction shall comply with all the regulations (except
lot area, shape, width, and depth) applicable to single family dwellings in
such zoning district.
6-105 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
   A.   Authority to Continue. Except as provided in Subsection F of this
Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming sign may be continued so long as
it otherwise remains lawful, subject to the regulations contained in
Subsections B through E of this Section and in Subsection D of Section
6-101 of this Code. The burden of establishing a sign to be a legal
nonconforming sign under this Section shall rest on the person asserting the
legal nonconforming status of such sign.
   B.   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement of non-bearing sign elements and electrical wiring and
fixtures may be performed on any sign; provided, however, that any repair or
replacement shall, whenever possible, eliminate or reduce any nonconformity in
the element being repaired or replaced, and provided further that this
Subsection B shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Subsections C
through F of this Section.
   C.   Alteration; Enlargement; Moving. No nonconforming sign shall be changed
or altered in any manner that would increase the degree of its nonconformity,
be enlarged or expanded, be structurally altered to prolong its useful life, or
be moved in whole or in part to any other location where it would remain
nonconforming. A change in sign message which does not otherwise violate the
provisions of this Code shall not be deemed to be prohibited by this
Subsection.
   D.   Change of Sign. A nonconforming sign that has been changed to eliminate
its nonconformity or any element of its nonconformity shall not thereafter be
changed to restore such nonconformity or nonconforming element.
   E.   Damage or Destruction. Any nonconforming sign, or any nonconforming
element of a sign capable of change or discontinuance separate from other
elements of the sign, damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of 35
percent or more of its replacement cost new shall not be restored but shall be
removed or brought into conformity with the provisions of this Code.
   F.   Termination of Certain Signs.
      1.   Immediate Termination. The following nonconforming signs or sign
features shall be terminated within 30 days after the effective date of this
Code by removal of the sign or by alteration of the sign to eliminate the
specified feature:
         (a)   Attention-getting devices.
         (b)   Moving or animated signs, except public service signs when
expressly permitted by this Code.
         (c)   Temporary signs, except as expressly permitted by Section
5-105 of this Code.
         (d)   Any sign on a tree or utility pole, whether on public or private
property, except governmental signs authorized in Section
5-105 of this Code.
         (e)   Any sign on public property, except governmental signs and civic
event signs authorized in Section
5-105 of this Code.
         (f)   Any sign that violates any provision or requirement of
Paragraphs 5-105E1 through 5-105E3 or 5-105E5 through 5-105E10 or Paragraph 5-
105E15 of this Code.
         (g)   Any sign constructed or erected without a valid permit.
         (h)   Any sign that should have been removed pursuant to Subsection 9-
49.3(c) of the Glencoe Village Code as in force immediately prior to the
effective date of this Code.
      2.   Termination by Abandonment. Any nonconforming sign the use of which
is discontinued for a period of 60 consecutive days, regardless of any intent
to resume or not to abandon such use, shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall
not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Every such sign, including all of
its structural elements, shall be immediately removed or brought into
conformity with the provisions of this Code. Any period of such discontinuance
caused by government actions, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, and
without any contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be
considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this
paragraph.
      3.   Termination by Change of Business. Any nonconforming sign
advertising, identifying, or pertaining to a business on the premises on which
it is located shall be terminated upon any change in the use of the property on
which the sign is located. Every such sign, including all of its structural
elements, shall be immediately removed or brought into con-formity with the
provisions of this Code.

the taking of such final action. The written resolution incorporating such
findings and conclusions shall be presented and approved at the next regular
public meeting of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   In any case where this Code provides that the failure of the Zoning Board of

considered final administrative determinations and shall be subject to appeal
in accordance with the administrative review procedures established by State

PART II: ZONING APPLICATIONS AND HEARINGS
7-201 APPLICATIONS
   A.   Place of Filing. All applications filed pursuant to this Code shall be
filed with the Office of the Village Manager or with such other Village
official or body as the Village Manager may by administrative order designate.
   B.   Form; Number; Scale. All applications filed pursuant to this Code shall
be on forms supplied by the Village and shall be filed in such number of
duplicate copies as the Village Manager may designate by administrative order.
All plans filed as part of any application shall be at a scale sufficient to
permit a clear and precise understanding of the contents of said plans and the
proposal being made and shall be folded to a size of 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches.
   C.   Filing Deadlines.
      1.   Applications Requiring Hearings. An application requiring a public
hearing will not be scheduled for such hearing unless filed, in proper form and
number and containing all required information, in accordance with the schedule
posted in the Village Manager's Office. An application so filed will be
scheduled for hearing on the requested hearing date, or on the first available
date thereafter open on the relevant hearing agenda, on a first-filed-first-
scheduled basis.
      2.   Applications Not Requiring Hearing. An application that does not
require a public hearing shall be filed, in proper form and number and
containing all required information, in accordance with the schedule posted in
the Village Manager's Office. An application so filed will be processed on a
first-filed-first-processed basis.
      3.   Supplemental Data. Whenever supplemental data in connection with a
previously filed application is required by the Village, it shall be submitted
by the application deadline for the meeting on which it is to be considered at
or acted upon in connection with such application. The failure to file such
data in a timely manner shall, in the discretion of the Village Manager and of
the body hearing the application, be cause to delay a requested or scheduled
hearing date.
   D.   Fees.
      1.   Fee Established; Lien. Every application filed pursuant to this Code
shall be accompanied by a non-refundable application and filing fee in
accordance with the fee schedule established by the  Village Manager. For
special use permit and zoning amendment applications, such fee may include
reimbursement of any recoverable costs incurred by the  Village. The owner of
the property subject of the application and, if different, the applicant shall
be jointly and severally liable for the payment of said fee. By signing the
application (either directly or through an agent), the owner shall be deemed to
have agreed to pay such fee and to consent to the filing and foreclosure of a
lien on the subject property to ensure collection of any such fee, plus the
costs of collection, in the event such fee has not been properly paid as
required with the filing of the application. Any lien filed pursuant to this
Subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or
mechanics' liens.
      2.   Recoverable Costs. The costs incurred by the Village in processing
an application shall be deemed to consist at least of the following items of
direct and indirect expense:
         (a)   Legal Publication (direct cost);
         (b)   Recording Secretarial Services (direct cost);
         (c)   Court Reporter (direct cost);
         (d)   Document Preparation and Review (hourly staff salary times a
multiplier to be established from time to time by administrative order of the
Village Manager at a level sufficient to recover 100 percent of the direct and
indirect cost of such service);
         (e)   Consultant Fees and Expenses (engineering, legal, planning,
etc.) (direct cost);
         (f)   Copy Reproduction (direct cost)
         (g)   Document Recordation (direct cost); and
         (h)   Inspection Fees (direct cost).
      3.   Fee Payment and Escrow.
         (a)   Initial Payment and Escrow. Every application for a special use
permit or a zoning amendment that is filed pursuant to this Code shall be
accompanied by the required fee plus an additional amount for recoverable costs
as provided in Paragraph D2 above, as fixed from time to time by administrative
order of the Village Manager, to be deposited in an application fee escrow. No
interest shall be payable on any such escrow.
         (b)   Charges Against Escrow. From the date of filing of any
application pursuant to this  Code, the Village shall maintain an accurate
record of the recoverable costs as herein above defined, incurred in the
processing such application. The Village Manager shall, from time to time, draw
funds from the escrow account established for such application to pay such
costs and shall transfer such funds to the appropriate Village accounts. The
Manager shall maintain an accurate record of all such drawings.
         (c)   Additional Escrow Deposits. Should the Village Manager at any
time determine that the escrow account established in connection with any
application is, or is likely to become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of
processing such application, the Manager shall inform the applicant of that
fact and demand an additional deposit in an amount deemed by him to be
sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs. Unless and until such
additional amount is deposited by the applicant, the Village Manager may direct
that processing of the application shall be suspended or terminated.
         (d)   Final Settlement. As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application, the Village Manager shall cause a final accounting to
be made of the escrow deposits made in connection with such application and the
actual cost of processing such application and shall make final charge of such
costs against such escrow deposits. A copy of the accounting shall be provided
to the owner and the applicant.
   If the amount in the escrow account is insufficient to pay the total actual
costs, a written demand for payment of the balance due shall be mailed to the
owner and the applicant. If unused balance remains in the escrow account after
paying the total actual costs, it shall be returned to the applicant.
      4.   Condition of All Applications, Approvals, and Permits; Time Periods.
No application filed pursuant to this Code shall be considered complete unless
and until all fees due pursuant to this Subsection have been paid. Every
approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this Code, whether or not
expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned upon payment of
fees as required by this Subsection.
   When this Code provides that the passage of time without decision or action
shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation for approval, all time periods
shall be tolled during any period of non-payment, but shall otherwise continue
to run.
   The failure to pay fully any such fee when due shall be grounds for refusing
to process an application and shall be deemed a withdrawal or forfeiture of any
permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the land or development to
which the unpaid fee relates.
   E.   Minimum Data Requirements. Every application submitted pursuant to this
Code shall contain such information as is required by the Village from time to
time. Application requirements shall be established by administrative order and
shall be made available to all applicants in the office of the Village Manager.
   F.   Special Data Requests. In addition to the data and information required
pursuant to Subsection E of this Section, every applicant shall submit such
other and additional data, information, or documentation as the Village Manager
or any board or commission before which its application is pending may deem
necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of
the particular application.
   G.   Waiver of Application Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section, the Village Manager shall have the authority to waive any
requirement set forth in Subsection A, B, C, or E of this Section when, in his
or her judgment, such waiver is appropriate in light of the nature and extent
of the relief being sought or in light of special circumstances making
compliance with those provisions either unnecessary or unduly burdensome;
provided, however, that any board or commission before which such application
may come shall continue to have the right to request additional information
pursuant to Subsection F of this Section and to delay processing of such
application until such information is provided and available in accordance with
the deadlines established in Subsection C of this Section. The Village Manager
shall provide his or her reasons why any such requirements have been waived,
and shall refer such reasons to the appropriate boards and commissions.
   H.   Concurrent Applications. When a proposed use or development requires
more than one approval pursuant to this  Code, applications for all such
approvals may be filed concurrently notwithstanding the fact that approval of
one application may be a pre-condition to approval of other applications. Such
applications may in the discretion of the official, officials, body, or bodies
charged with review of such applications be processed together; provided,
however, that no application shall be approved unless all applications that are
a pre-condition to its approval have first been approved.
   I.   Withdrawal of Application. An applicant may withdraw an application at
any time prior to a final decision having been rendered with respect thereto,
provided that the applicant shall have paid all applicable fees pursuant to
Subsection
7-201D of this Code. Such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the
applicant's right to refile such application, but any such refiling shall be
treated as an entirely new filing and shall be subject to the procedures and
fees of this Code in the same manner as any other new application.
7-202 SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS
   A.   Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred. Whenever any
application filed pursuant to this Code has been finally denied on its merits,
a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the
same form or on the same theory, shall not be brought unless in the opinion of
the officer, board, or commission before which it is brought  a mistake of law
or fact significantly affected the prior denial or there is substantial new
evidence available.
   B.   New Grounds to Be Stated. Any such second application shall include a
detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such application.
   C.   Summary Denial With or Without Hearing. Any such second application may
be denied by the Village Manager summarily, and without hearing, on a finding
that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where such
application is set for public hearing, the applicant shall be required to
establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application
prior to being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds
are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such failure.
   D.   Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second
application filed more than one year after the final denial of a prior
application shall be heard on the merits as though no prior application had
been filed. The applicant shall, however, be required to place in the record
all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have
developed since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such
evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.
7-203 PUBLIC HEARINGS AND MEETINGS
   A.   Setting Hearing or Meeting; Time Limitation. When the provisions of
this Code require a public hearing or meeting in connection with any

hearing or meeting shall, upon receipt of a properly completed application, fix
a reasonable time and place for such hearing or meeting; provided, however,
that such hearing or meeting shall be commenced no later than 60 days, and

of every public hearing set pursuant to Subsection A of this Section in
connection with any application for an amendment to this Code or the Zoning

newspaper of general circulation in the Village at least once no less than 15

Village commissions and departments for review and comment.
   D.   Conduct of Hearings
      1.   Rights of All Persons. Any person may appear and testify at a public
hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney, and may
submit documentary evidence; provided, however, that the hearing body may
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
      2.   Rights of Parties and Proximate Owners. Subject to the discretion of
the hearing body, the applicant, any board, commission, department, or official
of the Village, and any interested property owner may be allowed, in addition
to the rights granted by Paragraph D1 of this Section, any or all of the
following rights:
         (a)   To present witnesses on their behalf.

         (e)   To a continuance, upon request, for the purpose of presenting
evidence to rebut evidence introduced by any other person.
   In determining whether to grant or withhold such rights, the discretion of
the hearing body shall be governed by the goal of securing all information and

granted, however, when undue and unwarranted delay would result, or when to do
so would tend to produce no new evidence to aid the hearing body in reaching
its decision.
      3.   Adjournment of Hearing. The body conducting the  public hearing may
at any time, on its own motion or at the request of any person, adjourn the
hearing for a reasonable time and to a fixed date, time, and place, for the

information, deliberating further, or for such other reason as the hearing body
may find to be sufficient. The Staff Secretary of the hearing body shall notify

   E.   Pre-Hearing and Pre-Meeting Examination and Copying of Application and
Other Documents. At any time following the giving of notice as required in
Subsection B of this Section, and upon reasonable request, any person may
examine the application and, subject to the exceptions set forth in the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act, all other documents on file with the
Office of the Village Manager pertaining to the matter subject to such notice.
In addition, any person shall be entitled to copies of such application and
documents upon reasonable request and payment of a fee as established from time
to time by the Village Manager to cover the cost of such copies.
PART III: ZONING CERTIFICATES
7-301 CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE
   A.   Authority. The Village Manager shall have authority to issues
certificates of zoning compliance, but only in accordance with the provisions
of this Section.
   B.   Purpose. The certificate of zoning compliance is intended to serve two
general purposes. First, it provides a procedure for reviewing plans for
conformance with the Code and a means for evidencing such conformance. Second,
it serves as an adjunct to, and thus must be filed prior to or with, all other
applications filed pursuant to this Code with respect to a specific use or
development proposal. When so filed, it serves as a vehicle for routine plan
review by the Village Manager prior to consideration of special requests by
other officials, boards, and commissions, thus avoiding needless special
reviews of defective plans.
   C.   Certificate Required. Except where expressly waived by another
provision of this Code, unless a certificate of zoning compliance shall have
first been obtained from the Village Manager:
      1.   The construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving
of any structure shall not be commenced; and
      2.   No land vacant on the effective date of this Code shall be used or
occupied for any purpose, except open space; and
      3.   The grading, excavation, or improvement of land preliminary to any
construction or use of such land shall not be commenced; and
      4.   Building or other permits pertaining to the construction,
reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of any structure or the use
of any land or structure shall not be issued by the Village; and
      5.   No temporary use shall be established or maintained except as
provided on Paragraph 5-102C1 of this Code; and
      6.   No land shall be annexed to the Village.
   In any case where a certificate of zoning compliance is not required under
this Code, the Manager shall, on written request, issue a certificate of such
fact.
   D.   Relation to Other Applications. No application filed pursuant to Part
II of this Article VII with respect to a specific use or development proposal
shall be processed unless an application for a certificate of zoning compliance
shall first have been received, processed, and approved, or denied solely on
one or more grounds that form the basis for the application filed pursuant to
said Part II. It is the intent of this Section that no application filed
pursuant to Part II of this Article VII with respect to a specific use or
development proposal shall be processed until the Village Manager is satisfied
that the proposed use or development complies with the provisions of this Code
in all respects except those within the scope of such application. Any
application for a building permit shall also be deemed an application for a
certificate of zoning compliance.
   E.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for certificate of zoning compliance shall
be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code.
      2.   Action on Application. Within 10 days following receipt of a
completed application for a certificate of zoning compliance, the Village
Manager shall cause the application and related submissions to be reviewed for
compliance with this Code and shall inform the applicant whether the
application has been granted or denied. In any case where an application is
granted, the Manager shall issue a separate certificate of zoning compliance,
which shall state on its face, in bold type, that:
   THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT SIGNIFY BUILDING CODE REVIEW OR APPROVAL AND IS
NOT AUTHORIZATION TO UNDERTAKE ANY WORK WITHOUT SUCH REVIEW AND APPROVAL WHERE
EITHER IS    REQUIRED.   SEE THE GLENCOE BUILDING CODE FOR DETAILS.
   BEFORE ANY STRUCTURE TO WHICH THIS CERTIFICATE IS APPLICABLE MAY BE OCCUPIED
OR USED FOR ANY PURPOSE, A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY MUST BE OBTAINED. SEE
SECTION
7-302 OF THE GLENCOE ZONING CODE AND THE GLENCOE BUILDING CODE FOR DETAILS.
   Alternatively, the certificate of zoning compliance may be issued by means
of a stamp on any other permit issued by the Village, which stamp shall state
   CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE -- SEE ZONING CODE § 7-301 FOR CONDITIONS
AND LIMITATIONS.
   In any case where an application is denied, the Manager shall state the
specific reasons therefor and shall cite the specific provisions of this Code
upon which such denial is based. If relief from such demand would be available
pursuant to a companion application filed in connection with the application
for a certificate of zoning compliance the Manager shall so inform the
applicant and shall promptly process such companion application. If such
application is approved, the Manager shall issue the requested certificate of
zoning compliance in accordance with the terms and conditions of such approval.
   If relief from the Manager's denial of a certificate of zoning compliance
would be available by variation or special use permit, but no application
therefor has been filed, the Manager shall so state and shall refer the
applicant to the appropriate provisions of this Code.
      3.   Contents of Certificate. Each certificate of zoning compliance (or
accompanying building permit, as the case may be) issued pursuant to this
Section shall state the specific use of the subject property for which it is
issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any, pursuant to which it is
issued, and shall set forth any conditions imposed in connection with any
approval granted pursuant to this Code.
      4.   File of Certificates. Every certificate issued pursuant to this
Section shall be kept on file in the central address files and shall be a
public record open to inspection in accordance with the provisions of the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act.
   F.   Effect of Issuance of Certificate of Zoning Compliance. The issuance of
a certificate of zoning compliance shall not authorize the establishment,
expansion, or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
relocation, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for
any additional permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and
ordinances of the Village, including but not limited to a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
   G.   Limitations on Certificates. Subject to an extension of time granted by
the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
7-101K of this Code, a certificate of zoning compliance shall become null and
void six months after the date on which it was issued unless within such period
construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of a structure
is commenced or a use is commenced.
   H.   Void Certificates. Any certificate of zoning compliance issued in
violation of the provisions of this Code, whether intentionally, negligently,
or innocently, shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights
whatsoever.
7-302 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
   A.   Authority. The Village Manager shall have authority to issue
certificates of occupancy; provided, however, that no such certificate shall be
issued except in accordance with the provisions of this Section and the
provisions of the Village Code governing development, building, and related
matters.
   B.   Purpose. For the purposes of this Code, the certificate of occupancy
provides a procedure for the inspection of completed premises to ensure their
compliance with this Code and approved plans prior to commencement of the use
or occupancy of such premises. The certificate may also evidence compliance
with other provisions of the Village Code as set forth in those provisions.
   C.   Certificate Required. Unless a certificate of occupancy shall have
first been obtained certifying compliance with the provisions of this Code:
      1.   No structure, or addition thereto, constructed, reconstructed,
remodeled, altered, or moved after the effective date of this Code shall be
occupied or used for any purpose; and
      2.   No land vacant as of the effective date of this Code shall be used
or occupied for any purpose, except open space; and
      3.   Except for changes involving only substitution of occupants in
existing dwelling units, no use or occupancy of any land or structure shall be
changed to any other use or occupancy, whether or not construction, remodeling,
alteration, or moving is involved.
   This Subsection shall not apply to signs regulated by Section
5-105 of this Code.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. When no certificate of zoning compliance is required,
applications for certificate of occupancy shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code. When a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued,
the application for that certificate shall also be treated as the application
for a certificate of occupancy and shall be processed as such at such time as
the applicant notifies the Village Manager in writing that the subject
structure or use is ready for a certificate of occupancy in accordance with the
certificate of zoning compliance.
      2.   Action on Application. Within 10 days following the receipt of a
completed application or a written notice from the applicant in accordance with
Paragraph D1 of this Section, the Village Manager shall cause the subject
structure or premises to be inspected and shall take one of the following
actions based on such inspection:
         (a)   If all work has been completed and the structure and use thereof
are in full and complete compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Code, other relevant codes and ordinances of the Village, the applicant's plans
as approved, and any conditions attached to any approval issued pursuant to
this Code, the Village Manager shall issue a certificate of occupancy.
         (b)   If, however, all work is not complete or is in any manner not in
full compliance with all applicable requirements, the Village Manager shall
deny the application and shall inform the applicant in writing of the specific
deficiencies on which such denial is based, citing the particular provisions of
the codes and ordinances of Village, the particular items in the applicant's
plan or the applicable special approval conditions with respect to which
compliance is lacking.
      3.   Content of Certificate. In addition to the matters required to be
contained in a certificate of occupancy pursuant to other applicable provisions
of the Village Code, each certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this
Section shall state the specific use of the subject property for which it is
issued and shall set forth any conditions imposed in connection with any
approval granted pursuant to this Code.
      4.   Filing of Certificates. Every certificate of occupancy issued
pursuant to this Section shall be kept on file in the central address files and
shall be a public record open to inspection pursuant to the provisions of the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act.
   E.   Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Paragraph D2 of this Section, when construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or
alteration of a structure does not require the vacating of the structure, or
when parts of the structure are finished and ready for occupancy before the
completion of such construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or alteration and
are certified upon inspection to be safe for use or occupancy and to be in full
compliance with all applicable provisions of this Code, other relevant codes
and ordinances of the Village, the applicant's plans as approved and any
conditions attached to any approvals issued pursuant to this Code with respect
to such structure or its premises, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued for a period not to exceed six months from its date, which temporary
certificate shall bear on its face a statement of its temporary nature;
provided, however, that no such temporary certificate shall be issued pursuant
to this Code unless said structure also qualifies for a temporary certificate
of occupancy issued pursuant to the Building Code. Temporary certificates of
occupancy pursuant to this Section and the Building Code may be jointly issued.
   F.   Certificate of Occupancy for Existing Uses. The Village Manager may
issue a certificate of occupancy certifying the lawful existence and use of any
existing structure or use in the same manner, and subject to the same standards
and limitations, as authorized by this Section with respect to new structures
and uses. Such certificate of occupancy shall be prima facie evidence of the
facts contained in it with respect to any structure or use as of the date of
its issuance and shall remain effective for that purpose for so long as neither
the use or structure nor the applicable provisions of this Code are changed.
   G.   Void Certificates. Any certificate of occupancy issued in violation of
the provisions of this Code, whether intentionally, negligently, or innocently,
shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever.
PART IV: INTERPRETATIONS, APPEALS, AND VARIATIONS
7-401 INTERPRETATIONS
   A.   Authority. The Village Manager, subject to the procedures, standards,
and limitations of this Section, may render interpretations, including use
interpretations, of the provisions of this Code and of any rule or regulation
issued pursuant to it.
   B.   Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this Section is
intended to recognize that the provisions of this Code, though detailed and
lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they may
have to be applied. Many such situations, however, can be readily addressed by
an interpretation of the specific provisions of this Code in light of the
general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted.
Because the interpretation authority herein established is an administrative
rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the
essential content of this Code but rather is intended only to allow
authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
   C.   Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations. Applications for
interpretations may be filed by any person having an interest in the
circumstances giving rise to the need for an interpretation; provided, however,
that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on
hypothetical facts or where the interpretation would have no effect other than
as an advisory opinion.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for interpretations of this Code shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code.
      2.   Action on Application. Within 30 days following the receipt of a
properly completed application for interpretation, the Village Manager shall
inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating the
specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the determination based.
The failure of the Manager to act within 30 days, or such further time to which
the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a contrary interpretation
rendered on the day following such 30-day period thereby allowing the applicant
to pursue an appeal pursuant to Section
7-402 of this Code.
      3.   Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Village Manager
may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided in Section
7-402 of this Code.
   E.   Standards for Use Interpretations. The following standards shall govern
the Village Manager, and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals from the
Manager, in issuing use interpretations:
      1.   Any use defined in Section
8-302 of this Code shall be interpreted as therein defined.
      2.   No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use
or a special permit use in a district to be established in any district in
which such use is not so listed.
      3.   No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless
evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with each use
limitation established for that particular district.
      4.   No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district
unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in such
district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses permitted or
specially permitted in a less restrictive district.
      5.   If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a
special use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use
interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a
special use permit for such use pursuant to Section
7-502 of this Code.
      6.   No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that
would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in
question.
      7.   Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, in rendering
use interpretations the Village Manager shall be guided by the Standard
Industrial Classification Manual and the use classification method-ology used
therein.
   F.   Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation. No use interpretation finding a
particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district
shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits and approvals that  may be required by the
codes and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, a special
use permit, a certificate of zoning compliance, a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
   G.   Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. Subject to an extension
of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
7-101K of this Code, no use interpretation finding a particular use to be
permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall be valid for a
period longer than six months from the date of issue unless a building permit
is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate of occupancy is
obtained and a use commenced within that period.
   A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially
permitted in a particular district shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to
authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has
not been issued. Such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any
force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any
reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
7-402 APPEALS
   A.   Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals
from, and review orders, decisions, determinations, or the failure to act, of
the Village Manager acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under
this Code, and to that end the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the same
powers and be subject to the same standards and limitations as the Village
Manager with respect to any order, decision, or determination being appealed.
   B.   Purpose. The appeal procedure is intended to avoid the need for resort
to legal action by establishing local procedures to review and correct
administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as a means to subvert the
clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this Code or the rightful authority of
the Village Manager to enforce the requirements of this Code. To these ends,
the reviewing body should give all proper deference to the spirit and intent
embodied in the language of this Code and to the reasonable interpretations of
that language by those charged with the administration of this Code.
   C.   Parties Entitled to Appeal. An appeal may be taken by any officer,
department, board, commission, or bureau of the Village, or by any person
aggrieved or adversely affected by an order, decision, determination, or
failure to act of the Village  Manager acting pursuant to his or her authority
and duties under this Code.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be filed not later than 45 days after the action being appealed
and in accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code.
      2.   Action by Village Manager. Upon receipt of a properly completed
application for an appeal, the Village Manager shall forthwith transmit to the
Zoning Board of Appeals all papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
      3.   Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted in accordance with Section
7-203 of this Code.
      4.   Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 45 days following the
close of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render a
decision on the appeal in the manner and form specified in Subsection
7-102H of this Code. Such decision may reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole or
in part, the action appealed from and may include such order or determination
as, in the opinion of the Board of Appeals, is proper to be made in the
premises. The failure of the Board of Appeals to act within such 45 days, or
such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision denying the appeal.
   E.   Stay of Proceedings. An application for appeal properly filed pursuant
to Subsection D of this Section shall stay all proceedings in the furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the Village Manager certifies to the Zoning
Board of Appeals after the application for appeal has been filed with the
Manager that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
the Manager's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by the Illinois Circuit Court on
application, upon reasonable written notice to the Manager and on due cause
shown.
   F.   Right to Grant Variation in Deciding Appeals. In any case where the
application for appeal is accompanied by an application for variation in
accordance with Section
7-403 of this Code, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to
grant, as part of the relief, a variation, but only in strict compliance with
each provision of Section
7-403 of this Code.
   G.   Conditions and Limitations on Rights Granted by Appeal. In any case
where this Code imposes conditions and limitations upon any right, any such
right granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeal shall be subject to such
conditions and limitations in the same manner and to the same extent as if
secured without the necessity of an appeal.
7-403 VARIATIONS
   A.   Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to
grant variations from the provisions of this Code, but only in compliance with
the provisions of this Section.
   B.   Purpose. The variation procedure is intended to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from particular applications
of this Code that create practical difficulties or particular hardships for
which no other remedy is available.
   C.   Parties Entitled to Seek Variations. Applications for variations may be
filed by the owner of the subject property.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for variations shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code. In addition, every application for variation shall include
a landscaping plan or other evidence of landscaping for the lot or lots for
which the variation is sought.
      2.   Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted in accordance with Section
7-203 of this Code.
         (a)   Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 45 days following the
close of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render its
decision granting or denying the variation, in the manner and form specified by
Subsection
7-102H of this Code. The failure of the Board of Appeals to act within 45 days,
or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision denying the variation.
   E.   Authorized Variations
      1.   Permitted Variations. The Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the
provisions of this Code only as provided in this Paragraph E1. The authority of
the Zoning Board of Appeals to vary the provisions of this Code are subject to
the prohibitions set forth in Paragraph E2 of this Section and proof by the
applicant of each of the standards set forth in Subsection F of this Section.
   Under no circumstances shall the list of permitted variations in this
Paragraph E1 be construed as an entitlement, right, or claim for any applicant.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the provisions of this Code in harmony
with its authority and purposes and so that the spirit of this Code shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done in
the following cases and in no others:
         (a)   To reduce by not more than 20 percent the dimension of any
required front, side, or rear yard, or setback; provided, however, that where
the maximum front yard variation provided by this Subparagraph requires a front
yard greater than 25 percent of the depth of the lot, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may make a further variation which shall in no case establish a front
yard line at a distance less than 25 percent of the lot depth; provided further
that where the rear lot line in a residential district abuts the rear or side
lot line of a lot zoned B-1 or B-2, the Zoning Board of Appeals may further
reduce the dimension of any required rear yard to allow for the construction,
reconstruction, or expansion of any accessory structure on the residential
property (Amended Oct 1994); provided further that on corner or through lots,
the Zoning Board of Appeals may reduce the required front setback for accessory
structures, including residential recreational facilities, to no less than 12
feet; provided further, however, that no variation shall be granted from Green
Bay Road yard requirements for lots in the B-2 District. (Am. Ord. 2022-08-
3528, passed 3-17-2022)
         (b)   To increase by not more than five percent the maximum allowable
height of a structure.
         (c)   To reduce by not more than 10 percent the required lot area of
any lot.
         (d)   To reduce by not more than 15 percent the required average lot
width of any lot.
         (e)   To increase by not more than 15 percent the maximum total ground
coverage of a lot or the maximum building coverage allowed for accessory
buildings.
         (f)   To allow, notwithstanding the limitations contained in
Subparagraphs (a), (c), (d), and (e) of this Paragraph, the restoration of a
structure occupied by a nonconforming use or a nonconforming accessory
structure, when such structure has been damaged or destroyed to the extent of
more than 50 percent of the cost of replacing such structure new, without
elimination of such nonconformity, and without requiring any special use permit
that might otherwise be required pursuant to Section
7-502 of this Code.
         (g)   (deleted - Feb 19, 2004
         (h)   (reserved)
         (i)   To increase by not more than 15 percent the maximum gross floor
area of the structures on a lot.
         (j)   For a vertical extension of a nonconforming structure only, to
reduce by any amount the dimensions of the required front, side, or rear yard
or setback, provided that no point on such vertical extension is closer to the
front, side, or rear lot line than the portion of the  nonconforming structure
over which the vertical extension is added.
         (k)   To permit any of the foregoing variations in excess of the
stated limits when necessary for the restoration of an historically or
aesthetically important feature of a structure that has been certified either
as a landmark or as part of any historic district in the Village.
         (l)   To allow the erection, maintenance, or moving of a sign
otherwise prohibited under Section
5-105 of this Code, provided that no variation shall allow a sign to exceed by
more than 15 percent the maximum height or signage area permitted in Section
5-105.
         (m)   Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c)
above, to vary the location, lighting, or use requirements for tennis courts.
         (n)   To allow portions of buildings to intercept the setback plane to
an extent greater than permitted under Paragraph 3-111G14 of this Code.
         (o)   To allow the construction of garages with vehicular doors
extending more than 18 feet, or a single door more than 9 feet, but not in
excess of 27 feet, along with the building front or corner building front,
notwithstanding the limitations based on frontage in Subsection
3-108C of this Code.
         (p)   To exercise such other powers of variation as are or may be
vested in the Zoning Board of Appeals by law.
      2.   Prohibited Variations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section, no variation shall be granted that is intended as a temporary measure
only.
   F.   Standards for Variations.
      1.   General Standard. No variation shall be granted pursuant to this
Section unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the strict
letter of the provisions of this Code would create a particular hardship or a
practical difficulty. Such a showing shall require proof that the variation
being sought satisfies each of the standards set forth in this Subsection F.
      2.   Unique Physical Condition. The subject property is exceptional as
compared to other lots subject to the same provision by reason of a unique
physical condition, including presence of an existing use, structure, or sign,
whether conforming or nonconforming; irregular or substandard shape or size;
exceptional topographical features; or other extraordinary physical conditions
peculiar to and inherent in the subject property that amount to more than a
mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot
rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot.
   Alternatively, a lot may qualify for a variation where there exists on or in
connection with such lot physical, historical, or architectural features that
have exceptional relevance to the surrounding properties or the community as a
whole, if the strict application of the regulation in question would affect
such features in a way that would cause detriment to the interests of
surrounding properties or the community as a whole; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall only apply to lots having a physical, historical, or
architectural feature that either: (a) is certified as a landmark pursuant to
Chapter 26A of the Glencoe Village Code, or (b) has received honorary status as
set forth in
chapter 26B of the Village Code, or (c) the Glencoe Historic Preservation
Commission has concluded that the lot satisfies the criteria for certification
as a landmark as set forth in
Chapter 26A of the Glencoe Village Code or honorary status as set forth in
chapter 26B of the Village Code.(Paragraph added and adopted December, 2002;
Amended Ord. 2013-10-3340, passed March 21, 2013)
      3.   Not Self-Created. The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the
result of any action or inaction of the owner, or of the owner's predecessors
in title and known to the owner prior to acquisition of the subject property,
and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a
variation is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of
governmental action, other than the adoption of this Code, for which no
compensation was paid.
      4.   Not Merely Special Privilege. The alleged hardship or difficulty is
not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special
privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other
lots subject to the same provision, nor merely an inability to make more money
from the  use of the subject property; provided, however, that where the
standards herein set out exist, the existence of an economic hardship shall not
be a prerequisite to the grant of an authorized variation.
      5.   Code and Plan Purposes. The variation would not result in a use or
development of the subject property that would be not in harmony with the
general and specific purposes for which this Code and the provision from which
a variation is sought were enacted.
      6.   Essential Character of the Area. The variation would not result in a
use or development on the subject property that:
         (a)   Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development, or value of property
or improvements permitted in the vicinity; or
         (b)   Would materially impair an adequate supply of light and air to
the properties and improvements in the vicinity; or
         (c)   Would substantially increase congestion in the public streets
due to traffic or parking; or
         (d)   Would unduly increase the danger of flood or fire; or
         (e)   Would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area; or
         (f)   Would endanger the public health or safety.
   G.   Variation Less Than Requested. A variation less than or different from
that requested may be granted when the record supports the applicant's right to
some relief but not to the relief requested.
   H.   Conditions on Variations. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such
specific conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character,
location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes
and objectives of this Code upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may
be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other
property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon
public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in
the resolution granting the variation and in any zoning or building permit
based thereon. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a
violation of this Code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
variation.
   I.   Parking Space Variation. In addition to the conditions set forth in
Subsection H of this Section, any variation in the number of parking spaces
required by Subparagraphs 5-104E1(h)(i) and 5-104E1(h)(ii) of this Code shall
be conditioned upon approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals of, and in strict
compliance with, a detailed parking plan setting forth the exact number of
parking spaces to be provided and showing all provisions for (1) wheel stops,
(2) markings, (3) surfacing, (4) screening and landscaping, (5) lighting, and
(6) access. Further, such variation may also be conditioned upon specific
limitations of the use of the premises, which limitations shall be
unconditionally agreed to by the owner of the premises and entered upon the
records of the Recorder of Deeds in the county where such premises are located.
Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting the
variation and in any zoning or building permit based thereon.
   J.   Affidavit of Compliance with Conditions. Whenever any variation
authorized pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions and
limitations to be met by the applicant, the Village Manager may require the
applicant, upon satisfying such conditions, to file with the  Village an
affidavit certifying such satisfaction.
   K.   Effect of Grant of Variation. The grant of a variation shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits and approval that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, a building permit,
a certificate of zoning compliance, and subdivision approval.
   L.   Limitations on Variations.
      1.   Time Period. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals as authorized by Paragraph 2 of this Subsection
7-403L, no variation from the provisions of this Code shall be valid for a
period longer than one year unless a building permit is issued and construction
is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion.
      2.   Time Extension. The Zoning Board of Appeals may, upon written
request of the owner of the subject property, extend the time limit imposed by
Paragraph L1 of this Section for a period not exceeding 12 months if it deems
such an extension appropriate and necessary to avoid undue hardship to such
owner. Such written request must be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals
prior to the expiration of the time limit for which an extension is sought. Any
such extension shall be made by written resolution.
      3.   Removal. A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular construction or development for which it was issued and shall
automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such
construction or development shall be removed and not replaced within twelve
months following such removal.
      4.   Expiration. In the event that any variation granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals becomes invalid by virtue of the passage of time pursuant to
Paragraphs L1 or L3 of this Section, the owner of the subject property may
reapply for such variation, but such re-application shall be treated as a new
application and shall be granted or denied based solely on the facts and
circumstances shown to exist at the time of such new application.
PART V: AMENDMENTS, SPECIAL APPROVALS, AND OTHER PERMITS
7-501 AMENDMENTS
   A.   Authority. This Code and the Zoning Map may be amended from time to
time by ordinance duly enacted by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the
procedures set out in this Section.
   B.   Purpose. The amendment process established by this Section is intended
to provide a means for making changes in the text of this Code and in the
Zoning Map that have more or less general significance or application. It is
not intended to relieve particular hardships nor to confer special privileges
or rights. Rather, it is intended as a tool to adjust the provisions of this
Code and the Zoning Map in light of changing, newly discovered, or newly
important conditions, situations, or knowledge.
   C.   Parties Entitled to Seek Amendment. An application for an amendment may
be filed by the Board of Trustees, the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Plan
Commission, the owner of any property to be affected by a proposed amendment to
the Zoning Map, or any person interested in a proposed amendment to the text of
this Code.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Application for amendments shall be filed in accordance
with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code; provided, however, that amendments proposed by the Board of
Trustees, the Zoning Board of Appeals, or the Plan Commission, shall not be
subject to said Section but shall be transmitted to the Village Manager in such
form as may seem appropriate to the initiating body.
      2.   Preliminary Consideration by Board of Trustees.
         (a)   Referral to Board. Every properly filed and completed
application or proposal for an  amendment to this Code, before being processed
in any other manner, shall be referred to the  Board of Trustees for a
determination as to whether the application merits a hearing and consideration
by the Zoning Commission or should be summarily denied.
         (b)   Notice of Applicant; Right to be Heard. Notice of the meeting at
which the issue will be considered shall be given to the applicant at least 48
hours before such meeting and the applicant or his representative shall,
subject to the rules of the Board of Trustees, have the right to be heard on
the issue.
         (c)   Action by Board. The Board of Trustees, not later than the first
meeting after the meeting at which the issue first appears on its agenda, shall
either summarily deny the application or refer it to the Zoning Commission for
public hearing. The affirmative vote of at least four members of the Board of
Trustees shall be necessary to summarily deny an application; any other vote
shall be sufficient to refer the application for a hearing. In the case of any
such referral, the date of such referral shall be deemed to be the date of
filing for computation of all time periods under this Code. A summary denial
shall have the same legal effect as a denial after a full hearing.
         (d)   Standard. In considering the issue of whether to summarily deny
or refer an application for hearing, the Board of Trustees shall be guided by
the legislative standard that applies to granting an application for an
amendment as set forth in Subsection E of this Section. The Board of Trustees
should summarily deny an application in any case where its legislative judgment
is that that standard cannot be met with regard to the proposed amendment.
      3.   Public Hearing. In any case where an application for amendment is
referred to the Zoning Commission for a hearing, a public hearing shall be set,
noticed, and conducted by the Zoning Commission in accordance with Section
7-203 of this Code.
      4.   Action by Zoning Commission. Within 45 days after the conclusion of
the public hearing, the Zoning Commission shall transmit to the Board of
Trustees its recommendation in the form specified by Subsection
7-103H of this Code. The failure of the Zoning Commission to act within 45
days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a
recommendation for the approval of the proposed amendment as submitted.
      5.   Action by Board of Trustees; Protest. Within 60 days after the
receipt of the recommendation of the  Zoning Commission, or its failure to act
as above provided, the Board of Trustees either shall deny the application or,
by ordinance duly adopted, shall adopt the proposed amendment, with or without
modifications; provided, however, that in the event a duly signed and
acknowledged protest against a proposed amendment is filed with the Village
Clerk before the adoption of such amendment by the owners of record of 20
percent or more of the frontage to be affected by the proposed amendment, or by
the owners of record of 20 percent or more of the  frontage immediately
adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of record of 20
percent or more of the frontage directly opposite the  frontage to be affected,
such amendment shall not be passed except by a two-thirds vote of all the
Trustees then holding office.
   The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying
the application.
   E.   Standard for Amendments. The wisdom of amending the Zoning Map or the
text of this Code is a matter committed to the sound legislative discretion of
the Board of Trustees and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in
determining whether a proposed amendment should be granted or denied, the Board
of Trustees should be guided by the principle that its power to amend this Code
is not an arbitrary one but one that may be exercised only when the public good
demands or requires the amendment to be made. In considering whether that
principle is satisfied in any particular case, the Board of Trustees should
weigh, among other factors, the following factors:
      1.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this
Code.
      2.   The existing uses and zoning classifications for properties in the
vicinity of the subject property.
      3.   The trend of development in the vicinity of the subject property,
including changes, if any, in such trend since the subject property was placed
in its present zoning classification.
      4.   The extent, if any, to which the value of the subject property is
diminished by the existing zoning classification applicable to it.
      5.   The extent, if any, to which any such diminution in value is offset
by an increase in the public health, safety, and welfare.
      6.   The extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent
properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
      7.   The extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties would
be affected by the proposed amendment.
      8.   The extent, if any, to which the future orderly development of
adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
      9.   The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or
permissible under its present zoning classification.
      10.   The availability, where relevant, of adequate ingress to and egress
from the subject property and the extent to which traffic conditions in the
immediate vicinity of the subject property would be affected by the proposed
amendment.
      11.   The availability, where relevant, of adequate utilities and
essential public services to the subject property to accommodate the uses
permitted or permissible under its present zoning classification.
      12.   The length of time, if any, that the subject property has been
vacant, considered in the context of the pace of development in the vicinity of
the subject property.
      13.   The community need for the proposed amendment and for the uses and
development it would allow.
      14.   The reasons, where relevant, why the subject property should be
established as part of an overlay district and the positive and negative
effects such establishment could be expected to have on persons residing in the
area.
7-502 SPECIAL USE PERMITS
   A.   Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set forth in this Section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant
special use permits authorizing the development of uses listed as special uses
in the regulations applicable to the district in which the subject property is
located.
   B.   Purpose. Special uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the
desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses
that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a
weighing, in each case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact
and effect.
   C.   Parties Entitled to Seek Special Use Permits. An application for a
special use permit may be filed by the owner of the subject property.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for special use permits shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code.
      2.   Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Zoning Commission in accordance with Section
7-203 of this Code.
      3.   Action by Zoning Commission. Within 45 days after the conclusion of
the public hearing, the Zoning Commission shall transmit to the Board of
Trustees its recommendation in the form specified by Subsection
7-103H of this Code, recommending either granting the application for a special
use permit; granting the application subject to conditions, as specified in
Subsection F of this Section; or denying the application. The failure of the
Zoning Commission to act within 45 days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the
proposed special use permit.
      4.   Action by Board of Trustees. Within 60 days after the receipt of the
recommendation of the Zoning Commission, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees either shall deny the application or, by
ordinance duly adopted, shall grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within
60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
to be a decision denying the special use permit.
   E.   Standards for Special Use Permits.
      1.   General Standards. No special use permit shall be recommended or
granted pursuant to this Section unless the applicant shall establish that:
         (a)   Code and Plan Purposes. The proposed use and development will be
in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this Code was
enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were
established and with the general purpose and intent of the Official
Comprehensive Plan.
         (b)   No Undue Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will
not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the
character of the area, parking, utility facilities, and other matters affecting
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
         (c)   No Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use
and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to
dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations.
         (d)   Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development
will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as
streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection,
refuse disposal, water and sewers, parks, libraries, and schools, or the
applicant will provide adequately for such services.
         (e)   No Traffic Congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
residential streets.
         (f)   No Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural,
scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
         (g)   Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and development
complies with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular
provision of this Code authorizing such use.
      2.   Special Standards for Specified Special Uses. When the district
regulations authorizing any special use in a particular district impose special
standards to be met by such use in such district, a permit for such use in such
district shall not be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall
establish compliance with such special standards.
      3.   Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Zoning Commission
and the Board of Trustees shall consider:
         (a)   Public Benefit. Whether and to what extent the proposed use and
development at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable to
provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of the public
convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood
or community.
         (b)   Alternative Locations. Whether and to what extent such public
goals can be met by the location of the proposed use and development at some
other site or in some other area that may be more appropriate than the proposed
site.
         (c)   Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether and to what extent all
steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed
use and development on the immediate vicinity through building design, site
design, landscaping, and screening.
   F.   Conditions on Special Use Permits. The Zoning Commission may recommend
and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations concerning
use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other
matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this Code upon the premises
benefitted by a special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate to
prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the
vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services and to
insure compliance with the standards in this Section. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any
such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
   G.   Affidavit of Compliance with Conditions. Whenever any special use
permit granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such
conditions, file an affidavit with the Village Manager so stating.
   H.   Effect of Issuance of a Special Use Permit. The grant of a special use
permit shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building, or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any other permits or approvals that may be
required by the codes and ordinances of the Village, including but not limited
to a building permit, a certificate of zoning compliance, a certificate of
occupancy, and subdivision approval.
   I.   Limitations on Special Use Permits.
      1.   Time Period. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Board of
Trustees as authorized by Paragraph 2 of this Subsection
7-502I, no special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year
unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a
certificate of zoning compliance is issued and a use commenced within that
period.
      2.   Time Extension. The Board of Trustees may, upon request of the owner
of the subject property, extend the time limit imposed by Paragraph 12 of this
Section for a period not exceeding 12 months if it deems such an extension
appropriate. Such written request must be submitted to the Board of Trustees
prior to the expiration of the time limit for which an extension is sought. Any
such extension shall be made by written resolution or ordinance.
      3.   Termination. A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only
the particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically
expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any
reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
      4.   Site Specific. Except when otherwise provided in the ordinance
granting a special use permit, a  special use permit shall be deemed to relate
to, and be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than the
owner or operator of such use or  lot.
   J.   Amendments to Special Use Permits. Except for time extensions pursuant
to Paragraph 7-502I2, a special use permit may be amended, varied, or altered
only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the standards and limitations
provided in this Section for its original approval.
7-503 EXTERIOR APPEARANCE REVIEW
   A.   Authority. The Village Manager, Plan Commission, and Board of*new 1997
Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this
Section, may grant approval of building permit applications requiring exterior
appearance review and approval pursuant to Subsections 3-108B and 4-107A of
this Code.
   B.   Purpose. The appearance review process is intended to protect,
preserve, and enhance the character and architectural heritage and quality of
the Village, to pro-tect, preserve, and enhance property values, and to promote
the health, safety, and welfare of the Village and its residents.
   C.   Parties Entitled to Seek Exterior Appearance Review. Applications for
building permits requiring appearance review and approval pursuant to this Code
may be filed by the owner of the subject property.
   D.   Procedure. *new 1997
      1.   Application. Applications for building permits requiring exterior
appearance review and approval pursuant to this Code shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code. In addition to information otherwise provided with a
building permit application, an application for appearance review and approval
shall also include the following information:
         (a)   Detailed plans depicting all work proposed to be done, including
detail renderings of any exterior alterations and of the exterior of any
proposed new building. Such rendering shall show proposed exterior colors and
textures.
         (b)   A statement of how the work proposed to be done satisfies the
objectives and criteria of the appearance guide.
         (c)   Such other and additional data, information, or documentation as
the Village Manager or any board or commission before which its application is
pending may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration
and disposition of the particular application.
      2.   Action by Village Manager.
         (a)   Referral to Plan Commission. Except as provided in Subparagraph
2(b) of this Subsection, the Village Manager shall deliver each application for
a building permit for which appearance review and approval is required to the
Plan Commission within 28 days after the filing of said application.
         (b)   Specified Categories of Applications. Whenever the Plan
Commission shall specify categories of building permit applications, if any,
for which the Village Manager is to undertake appearance review and approval,
the Manager shall, within 28 days after the filing of such applications, review
each such application in accordance with the criteria set forth in Subsection E
of this Section. The Village Manager shall mail or personally deliver to the
applicant a written decision within said 28 day period either approving,
denying, or approving subject to modifications to the application. If the
Manager approves such application for exterior appearance review and approval,
or approves said application subject to modifications to which the applicant
agrees in writing to accept, or if the Manager fails to mail or personally
deliver to the applicant a written decision within said 28 day period, the
application for appearance review shall be deemed final and approved and shall
not be subject to further review by, or appeal to, any Village board or
commission; otherwise a public meeting before the Plan Commission shall be
conducted as provided for in Paragraph D3 of this Section.
      3.   Action by Plan Commission. Within 45 days after the Village Manager
delivers to the Plan Commission a building permit application for which
exterior appearance review and approval is required as provided for in
Subparagraph D2(a) of this Section, or within 45 days after the Village Manager
delivers a written decision on an application as provided for in Subparagraph
D2(b) of this Section, the Plan Commission shall set, notice and hold a public
meeting in accordance with the requirements of Section
7-203 of this Code and shall review said application in accordance with the
criteria set forth in Subsection E of this Section. Within 35 days after the
conclusion of the public meeting, the Plan Commission shall, by resolution
adopted in accordance with Subsection
7-104H of this Code, either:
         (a)   Approve the application as submitted; or
         (b)   On the basis of written findings in accordance with Paragraph E2
of this Section, approve it subject to specific modifications; or
         (c)   On the basis of such findings, deny approval of such
application.
   If the Plan Commission approves the application for appearance review and
approval or approves the application subject to modifications to which the
applicant agrees in writing to accept, or if the Plan Commission fails to act
within 35 days after the conclusion of the public meeting (or such further time
to which the applicant may agree), the application shall be deemed final and
approved and shall not be subject to further review by, or appeal to, any
Village board or commission. If the Plan Commission denies the application or
approves it subject to modifications that the applicant refuses to accept, then
the applicant may file an appeal to the Board of Trustees in accordance with
Paragraph D4 of this Section. If no such appeal is filed, the applicant shall
be deemed to have abandoned and withdrawn the application for a building permit
and appearance review and approval.
      4.   Appeal to Board of Trustees.
         (a)   Application for Appeal. An applicant may appeal a decision of
the Plan Commission either denying an application for appearance review and
approval or approving such application subject to modifications by filing with
the Village Manager an application for appeal to the Board of Trustees within
21 days after the decision of the Plan Commission. Such application for appeal
shall include the following information:
            (i)   A copy of the original application for appearance review and
approval.
            (ii)   A statement of the applicant’s position as to the alleged
errors in the Plan Commission’s actions on the application and as to why
approval of the application is justified and proper.
   The Village Manager shall promptly forward such application as well as the
decision of the Plan Commission to the Board of Trustees.
         (b)   Board Action. The Board of Trustees shall consider each
application for appeal at its first regular meeting scheduled not less than 21
days after the filing of such application for appeal, unless otherwise agreed
to by the Village and the applicant. Upon review of the application for appeal
and the decision of the Plan Commission, the Board of Trustees shall, by
resolution duly adopted, either approve the application for appearance review
and approval as submitted, or shall make modifications acceptable to the
applicant and approve such modified application, or shall disapprove it in
accordance with Subsection E of this Section either with or without a remand to
the Plan Commission for further consideration. The failure of the Board of
Trustees to act within 60 days after receipt of the application for appeal, or
such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed an
affirmance of the decision of the Plan Commission.
   E.   Design Guidelines and Criteria.
      1.   Design Guidelines. For purposes of this Section
7-503, the provisions of the design guidelines and criteria for the Village of
Glencoe, which may be adopted or amended from time-to-time pursuant to
resolution of the Village Board of Trustees (the “design guidelines”), shall
apply. To the extent any provision of the design guidelines is in conflict with
State law or with any ordinance of the Village, then such State law or Village
ordinance shall prevail. (Section E adopted Sept 11, 2003)
      2.   Criteria. No application for appearance review and approval shall be
disapproved or denied except on the basis of specific written findings directed
to objectives and standards in the appearance guide. In addition, no
application for appearance review and approval for a multiple family dwelling
in the RD District shall be approved if there is a finding that such
application has any of the following negative impacts:
         a)   Disproportionality. The proposed building is disproportionate in
size to surrounding development.
         b)   Misfit/Mismatch of Building and Lot. The proposed building is
disproportionate in size to the lot.
         c)   Intrusion. The proximity of the proposed building or unit to
another building or unit causes an unreasonable intrusion into the privacy of
another. (#2 added June 3, 2004)
   F.   Limitation. Approval of an application pursuant to this Section is not
a permit or an authorization for development but merely a mandatory criterion
for the issuance of a building permit. This Section shall not be construed to
limit the application or effect of the Village's building codes and ordinances
or to relieve the applicant from the responsibility of complying with all such
codes and ordinances. Appearance review and approval shall relate solely to the
work shown on the approved plans (subject to any required modifications) and it
shall be unlawful for any person to deviate from such plans without obtaining
an amendment to said plans in the same manner as herein provided for obtaining
the original exterior appearance review approval.
7-504 SITE PLAN REVIEW (Adopted 7-2000)
   A.   Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this Section and by Ordinance duly adopted, may grant site
plan approval to uses and developments requiring such approval pursuant to
Subsection
7-504C of this Code.
   B.   Purpose. The site plan review process recognizes that even those uses
and developments that have been determined to be generally suitable for
location in a particular district are capable of adversely affecting the
purposes for which this Code was enacted unless careful consideration is given
to critical design elements. It is the purpose of this Section to provide a
procedure for the review of the developer’s attention to such elements.
   C.   Site Plan Approval Required. Site plan approval shall be required in
connection with any development or use specifically requiring site plan review
and approval pursuant to this Code.
   D.   Parties Entitled to Seek Site Plan Approval. Applications for site plan
review may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual
interest in, the subject property.
   E.   Procedure.   
      1.   Application. Applications for site plan approval shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code.
      2.   Public Meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section
7-203 of this Code. Such public meeting may be continued from time-to-time.
      3.   Action by Plan Commission. Within 35 days following the conclusion
of the public meeting, the Plan Commission shall transmit to the Board of
Trustees its recommendation, recommending either approval of the site plan or
disapproval based on one or more of the standards set forth in Paragraph 7-
504F1 of this Code. In the case of any recommendation for disapproval,
suggestions as required by Paragraph 7-504F2 of this Code shall be provided.
The failure of the Plan Commission to act within 35 days, or such further time
to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation for
approval of the site plan as submitted.
      4.   Action by Board of Trustees. Within 60 days following receipt of the
recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as provided, the
Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, shall approve the site plan as
submitted, or shall make modifications acceptable to the applicant and approve
such modified site plan, or shall disapprove it in the manner hereinafter
specified either with or without a remand to the Plan Commission for further
consideration. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or
such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision denying site plan approval.
   F.   Standards for Site Plan Disapproval.
      1.   Standards. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 7-504E4, the
Board of Trustees shall not disapprove, and the Plan Commission shall not
recommend disapproval of, a site plan submitted pursuant to this Section except
on the basis of specific written findings directed to one or more of the
following standards:
         (a)   The application is incomplete in specified particulars.
         (a)   The application is submitted in connection with another
application, the approval of which is a condition precedent to the necessity
for site plan review, and the applicant has failed to secure approval of that
application.
         (b)   The site plan fails to adequately meet specified standards
required by this Code with respect to the proposed use or development,
including special use standards where applicable, or contains or reveals
violations of this Code or other applicable regulations that the applicant,
after written request, has failed or refused to supply or correct.
         (c)   The proposed site plan interferes with easements or rights-of-
way.
         (d)   The proposed site plan unreasonably destroys, damages,
detrimentally modifies, or interferes with the enjoyment of significant
natural, topographical, or physical features of the site.
         (e)   The proposed site plan is unreasonably injurious or detrimental
to the use and enjoyment of surrounding property.
         (f)   The proposed site plan creates undue traffic congestion or
hazards in the public streets, or the circulation elements of the proposed site
plan unreasonably create hazards to safety on or off site or disjointed,
inefficient pedestrian or vehicular circulation paths on or off site.
         (g)   The screening of the site does not provide adequate shielding
from or for nearby uses.
         (h)   The proposed structures or landscaping are unreasonably lacking
amenity in relation to, or are incompatible with, nearby structures and uses.
         (i)   In the case of site plans submitted in connection with an
application for a special use permit, the proposed site plan makes inadequate
provision for the creation or preservation of open space or for its continued
maintenance.
         (j)   The proposed site plan creates unreasonable drainage or erosion
problems or fails to fully and satisfactorily integrate the site into the
overall existing and planned drainage system serving the Village.
         (k)   The proposed site plan places unwarranted or unreasonable
burdens on specified utility systems serving the site or area or fails to fully
and satisfactorily integrate the site’s utilities into the overall existing and
planned utility systems serving the Village.
         (l)   The proposed site plan does not provide for required public
uses.
         (m)   The proposed site plan otherwise adversely affects the public
health, safety, or general welfare.
      2.   Alternative Approaches. In citing any of the foregoing standards,
other than those of Subparagraph 7-504F1(a) and 7-504F1(b), as the basis for
disapproving a site plan, the Plan Commission or the Board of Trustees shall
suggest alternative site plan approaches that could be developed to avoid the
specified deficiency or shall state the reasons why such deficiency cannot be
avoided consistent with the applicant’s objectives.
      3.   Effect of Site Plan Approval. Approval of a site plan shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filling, and processing
of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, a certificate of
zoning compliance, a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, and
subdivision approval. A copy of every approved site plan shall be filed with
the Village Manager and the development of the site shall be in substantial
conformity with such approved and filed plan.
      4.   Limitations on Site Plan Approval. Subject to an extension of time
granted by the Village Manager, no site plan approval shall be valid for a
period longer than one year unless a building permit is issued and construction
is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion or unless a certificate of occupancy is issued and a use commenced
within that period.
   G.   Adjustments to Site Plan During Development.
      2.   Minor Adjustments. During the development of the site, the Village
Manager may authorize minor adjustments to a site plan when such adjustments
appear necessary in light of technical or engineering considerations first
discovered during actual development. Such minor adjustments shall be limited
to the following:
         (a)   Altering the location of any one structure or group of
structures by not more than 20 feet or one-fourth of the distance shown on the
approved site plan between such structure or structures and any other structure
or any vehicular circulation element or any boundary of the site plan,
whichever is less.
         (b)   Altering the location of any circulation element by not more
than 20 feet or one-fourth of the distance shown on the approved site plan
between such circulation element and any structure, whichever is less.
         (c)   Altering the location of any open space by not more than 50
feet.
         (d)   Altering any final grade by not more than 10 percent of the
originally planned grade.
         (e)   Altering the location or type of landscaping elements.
   Such minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of
this Code and the site plan as approved, shall be the minimum necessary to
overcome the particular difficulty, and shall not be approved if they would
result in a violation of any standard or requirement of this Code.
      2.   Major Adjustments. Any adjustment to a site plan that is not
authorized by the preceding Paragraph 7-504I1 shall be considered to be a major
adjustment and shall be granted only upon application to and approval by the
Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, may grant
approval for a major adjustment without referral to the Plan Commission upon
finding that any change in the site plan as approved will be in substantial
conformity with said site plan. If the Board of Trustees determines that a
major adjustment is not in substantial conformity with the site plan as
approved, then the Board of Trustees shall refer the request to the Plan
Commission for further consideration and review as provided in Subsection
7-504E of this Code.
   H.   Amendments to Site Plan Following Completion of Development. After a
site is developed in accordance with an approved site plan, the approved site
plan may be amended, varied, or altered in the same manner and subject of the
same limitations, as provided for original approval of site plans.
7-505 CONTEXTUAL DESIGN REVIEW (Adopted 4/2005)
   A.   Authority. This Section establishes special regulations that apply
notwithstanding other general regulations in this Code, but only pursuant to
and subject to the purposes and procedures hereinafter set forth in this
Section. The Contextual Design Review Commission, in accordance with the
procedures, limitations, and standards set out in this Section or otherwise
duly adopted by the Contextual Design Review Commission, may grant contextual
design review approval for single family dwellings seeking such approval, which
approval may contain adjustments to the generally applicable zoning regulations
to the extent permitted in this Section and expressly authorized as part of any
contextual design review approval.
   B.   Purpose. The Board of Trustees recognizes that zoning regulations are,
by nature and necessity, to be applied generally to many different settings and
circumstances. Although such general applicability fosters consistency and
stability, particularly in residential areas, it does not always provide
sufficient flexibility to encourage excellence and innovation in design. In
addition, the strict standards for securing variations from the zoning
regulations in this Code may not accommodate the types of modest adjustments
needed for residential designs to reduce the appearance of excessive bulk while
enhancing the dwellings themselves, adjacent properties, and the neighborhoods
in which they are located. In order to address opportunities for enhanced
residential designs that reduce the appearance of excessive bulk and contribute
to and maintain the character of a neighborhood without adversely impacting
adjacent properties, this Section authorizes and encourages owners to submit
their proposed designs to the Contextual Design Review Commission. Minor
adjustments to the generally applicable regulations of this Code are available
to promote better residential design in the context of the Village's
neighborhoods. Contextual design review shall be entirely voluntary, and no
person shall be entitled to any adjustments from the regulations of this Code
under the Contextual Design Review procedures except with respect to a specific
design and overall plan expressly approved by the Contextual Design Review
Commission.
   C.   Applicability of Contextual Design Review. Contextual design review is
available for any new construction of, addition to, or alteration of a single
family dwelling. Contextual design review shall not be required for any single
family dwelling development, but no single family dwelling development shall be
entitled to seek or obtain any adjustments as authorized pursuant to Subsection
7-505G of this Code unless the Contextual Design Review Commission grants
contextual design review approval for a specific plan, and such adjustments
shall only be available for development conforming to such specific plan, as
well as any conditions of contextual design review approval. 
   D.   Parties Entitled to Seek Contextual Design Review Approval.
Applications for contextual design review may be filed by the owner of, or any
person having a contractual interest in, the subject property.
   E.   Procedure.
      1.   Pre-Application. Prior to filing an application for contextual
design review, a prospective applicant shall contact the Staff Secretary to the
Contextual Design Review Commission to schedule a pre-application meeting. The
Staff Secretary, or not more than two members of the Commission, or both shall
meet with the prospective applicant to review the process and to preliminarily
assess the single family dwelling development that is contemplated to be the
subject of an application for contextual design review. Following such meeting,
a prospective applicant shall have the right, but not the obligation, to file
an application for contextual design review.
      2.   Application; Fee. Applications for contextual design review approval
shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section
7-201 of this Code, and such applications shall also include at least the
following information and materials:
         a.   Existing and proposed site plan of the subject property;
         b.   Elevations of the proposed development on the subject property;
         c.   Photographic composite of existing structures in its environs (as
determined in the pre-application meeting);
         d.   Photographic composite of the proposed development in its
environs (as determined in the pre-application meeting);
         e.   Landscaping plans, showing existing and proposed landscaping on
the subject property;
         f.   Photographs of the subject property;
         g.   Architectural plans for the proposed development; and
         h.   Samples of materials for the proposed development on the subject
property.
   Notwithstanding anything in Section
7-201 to the contrary, no fee shall be required in connection with an
application for contextual design review, nor shall there be any limitation on
successive applications for contextual design review. Any person who files an
application for contextual design review shall be deemed to acknowledge and
agree that: (i) the contextual design review process is entirely voluntary;
(ii) the determination of the Commission to decline the granting of adjustments
pursuant to contextual design review approval does not constitute any
deprivation of rights; and (iii) the applicant shall have no right to appeal or
otherwise challenge a determination of the Commission with respect to an
application other than to withdraw from the contextual design review process.
      3.   Public Meeting; Notices. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Commission in accordance with Section
7-203 of this Code. In addition, notice shall be provided by regular or
certified mail to each dwelling unit located within 250 feet of the subject
property. Prior to any meeting relating to an application for contextual design
review, the Village Manager shall cause a staff report to be prepared and
delivered to the members of the Commission relating to such application. Such
public meeting may be continued from time-to-time, and the Commission may
decline to act on any application for which the applicant or the applicant's
representative is not present. At public meetings, the Commission shall provide
the applicant and any other person the opportunity to comment on the
application.
      4.   Action by the Commission. Within 35 days following the conclusion of
the public meeting, the Commission shall either approve an application for
adjustments pursuant to this Section, approve such application with conditions,
or decline to grant any adjustments for a proposed single family dwelling
development. The Commission may provisionally approve any application for
contextual design review and delegate the final terms of approval (including
any conditions thereon) to one or more members, the Village staff, or some
combination thereof. In addition, an applicant seeking adjustments pursuant to
contextual design review may withdraw from the process at any time without
limitation or consequence, and upon such withdrawal such applicant shall have
the right to develop the subject property in any manner otherwise authorized
under the Code exclusive of the provisions of this Section. No approval or
conditional approval for contextual design review shall be binding upon an
applicant unless and until such applicant seeks, obtains, and begins to
prosecute development on the subject property pursuant to a building permit
based on plans that incorporate adjustments authorized as part of a contextual
design review approval. Upon such approval becoming binding, no person may
pursue the development except in strict conformity with the contextual design
review approval, including the approved plans and any conditions on such
approval, and the Commission may require appropriate documentation to
demonstrate the owner's consent to the contextual design review approval and
any conditions thereon. Whenever a contextual design review approval is either
(a) based upon the maintenance of a particular feature of the single family
dwelling or lot receiving such approval, or (b) authorizing an increase in the
otherwise allowable maximum gross floor area, the Commission shall require the
applicant to execute and record a declaration of covenants against the subject
property.
      5.   Honorary Landmarks. For any single family dwelling that has been
granted honorary landmark status or is included within a recognized historic
area pursuant to
chapter 26B of the Village Code, no contextual design review approval may be
sought or granted unless the Glencoe Historic Preservation Commission has first
granted favorable advisory review of the proposed development pursuant to
Section
26B-30 of the Village Code. Upon such favorable advisory review, an application
for contextual design review may be considered and adjustments may be approved,
provided that the plans approved pursuant to such contextual design review are
substantially the same as those for which favorable advisory review was granted
by the Historic Preservation Commission.
(Amended Ord. 2013-10-3340, passed March 21, 2013)
   F.   Standards for Contextual Design Review Approval. Because the contextual
design review process is entirely voluntary, applicants are deemed to
acknowledge and agree that: (i) they have no right or expectation that any
adjustments will be authorized for their proposed single family dwelling
development; and (ii) approval of any adjustments shall be granted only in the
sole discretion of the Commission. The Commission shall develop and recommend
guidelines for both alterations and new construction of single family dwellings
in connection with its contextual design review activities; provided, however,
that no guidelines shall be established unless first approved by a resolution
of the Board of Trustees; general satisfaction of such approved guidelines
shall be necessary, but not sufficient, for an application to receive
contextual design review approval.
   G.   Authorized Adjustments. When the Contextual Design Review Commission
determines that excellence and innovation will be enhanced in a manner that
contributes to and maintains the character of a neighborhood without adversely
affecting adjacent properties and otherwise advances the purposes of this
Section, the Commission may approve adjustments to the otherwise applicable
provisions of this Code in connection with the approval of any application for
contextual design review in the following respects and no others:
      1.   Chimney projections into side yard setback up to 6’-0” in width and
2’-0” in depth;
      2.   5% increase in the maximum gross floor area limits, but such
increase may only be applied to the principal single family dwelling on the
subject property;
      3.   For lots having a lot width of at least 80 feet, reductions in the
side yard setback for a detached garage to a minimum of five feet; provided
that such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
Subparagraph 3-111G20(b) and 3-111G20(c) of this Code;
      4.   In lieu of the exclusions authorized pursuant to Subparagraph 3-
111G12(a) or 3-111G12(b), exclusions from the calculation of maximum gross
floor area of either: (a) 400 square feet for an attached garage located in the
rear half of the lot, but not for any garage along a corner building front; or
(b) 600 square feet for a detached garage;
      5.   Bay projection into side yard setback up to 8’-0” in width and 2’-0”
in depth;
      6.   An exclusion from the calculation of maximum gross floor area of 400
square feet for attic space in the principal single family dwelling on the
subject property;
      7.   In lieu of the exclusions authorized pursuant to Subparagraph 3-
111G12(e), exclusions from the calculation of maximum gross floor area of
underbay or undereave areas when determined to be a defining element of the
architectural style (i.e. Prairie style);
      8.   An exclusion from the calculation of maximum gross floor area of a
basement when a raised first floor is determined appropriate for the
architectural style of the dwelling;
      9.   For pre-FAR single family dwellings only, reduced interior stair
width, reduced stair height clearance, and/or reduced handrail height for
porches, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Code or the
Village Code.
   To the extent that the owner of a lot elects to accept adjustments approved
pursuant to contextual design review relating to the maximum gross floor area
under Paragraphs G2, G4, G6, G7, or G8 of this Section
7-505, no variations from the maximum gross floor area may be sought or
obtained for such lot pursuant to this Code. In addition, for any single family
dwelling utilizing adjustments approved pursuant to contextual design review,
the cumulative adjustment to gross floor area allowable pursuant to the
provisions of Paragraph 3-111G12 or Subsection
7-505G of this Code shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the maximum gross
floor area applicable to such lot as calculated pursuant to Subsection
3-111E of this Code.
   H.   Inspections; Plan Modifications; Enforcement and Penalties; Costs.
      1.   Any single family dwelling that incorporates adjustments approved
pursuant to this Section shall be subject to periodic inspection by the Village
Manager or the Manager's designee to ensure conformity with the terms of the
contextual design review approval, including the approved plans and any
conditions of such approval. No modifications to the approved plans, and no
deviations from the conditions of contextual design review approval, shall be
permitted without the approval of the Contextual Design Review Commission;
provided, however, that the Commission may approve minor modifications
recommended for approval by the Village staff as part of a consent agenda and
without a new application.
      2.   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any development of a
single family dwelling for which a building permit was issued that incorporated
any adjustments authorized pursuant to this Section unless such development has
been completed in strict compliance with the plans approved as part of the
contextual design review, as well as any conditions of such contextual design
review approval.
      3.   When adjustments authorized pursuant to this Section are
incorporated into a single family dwelling development, any deviation from the
plans approved as part of a contextual design review and any failure to comply
with the conditions of contextual design review approval shall be deemed a
violation of this Code, and shall subject the owner to fines in an amount not
to exceed $750 for each day the violation continues. In addition, the Village
may also exercise any other remedy available at law, including specific
performance and injunctive relief.
      4.   Because of the voluntary nature of the contextual design review
process, any applicant who receives contextual design review approval and
thereafter incorporates the adjustments authorized pursuant to this Section
into a single family dwelling development shall be deemed to agree to reimburse
the Village for any costs that the Village might incur (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) in connection with any enforcement action wherein a violation
is found.
PART VI: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
7-601 GENERAL ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND DUTY
   Upon finding the existence of any violation of this Code, the Village
Manager shall have the authority and duty to take or direct all actions
necessary or appropriate to abate and redress such violation.
7-602 CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT
   A.   Stop and Cease-and-Desist Orders. Upon finding the existence of any
violation of this Code, the Village Manager shall notify, in writing, the
person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation
and ordering the action necessary to correct it; specifically, the Manager
shall order the discontinuance of any illegal use of land or structures, the
removal of illegal structures, additions, or alterations, and the
discontinuance of illegal work being done.
   B.   Legal Actions. In the enforcement of this Code, the Village Manager
shall exercise all the powers authorized by the statutes of the State of
Illinois and Village codes and ordinances to ensure compliance with, or to
prevent or abate any violation of, the provisions of this Code, and in
particular shall, where necessary or appropriate, institute or cause to be
instituted by the Village Attorney in the name of the Village any and all
actions, legal or equitable, includ-ing appeals, that may be required for the
enforcement of this Code.
   C.   Abatement; Liens. Where authorized by State statute, the Village
Manager may order any work necessary to abate any violation of this Code and
shall assess the cost of such work, including attorneys fees, to the property
owner. Upon the failure of the owner to pay such cost, the Manager shall file a
lien for such costs and for all costs of collection against the property in
question.
   D.   Revocation of Rezonings, Permits, Variations, or Approvals. The
violation of any provision of this Code, or of any permit or approval granted
pursuant to this Code, or of any condition imposed pursuant to this Code shall
be grounds for the revocation of any rezoning, permit, variation, or approval
granted pursuant to this Code and affecting the property involved in the
violation. The Village Manager may recommend and the Board of Trustees may
order such revocation; provided, however, that where the original rezoning,
permit, variation, or approval was granted following a public hearing required
pursuant to this Code, the revocation shall be preceded by a similar public
hearing.
   E.   Fines. In the enforcement of this Code, the Village Manager shall,
where necessary and appropriate, order the issuance and enforcement of
citations to recover fines and penalties for the violation of this Code as
authorized by State law and this Code.
7-603 PENALTIES
   Any person who shall violate, disobey, omit, neglect, or refuse to comply
with, or who shall resist enforcement of, any provision of this Code shall be
subject to a fine of not more than $100.00 for each offense. Each day a
violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense.
7-604 PRIVATE REMEDIES PRESERVED
   Nothing in this Part VI shall be interpreted to prevent any person entitled
to relief in law or equity by reason of a violation of the provisions of this
Code from bringing an appropriate action to secure such relief.
ARTICLE VIII

PART I: APPLICABILITY
8-101 GENERAL APPLICABILITY
   A.   Territorial Application. This Code shall apply to all land, structures,
and uses within the corporate limits of the Village.
   B.   General Application. All structures erected hereafter, all uses of land
or structures established hereafter, all structural alterations or relocations
of existing structures occurring hereafter, and all enlargements and extensions
of, additions to, changes in, and relocations of existing uses occurring
hereafter shall be subject to all regulations of this Code applicable to the
zoning districts in which such land, structures, or uses are located. Existing
structures and uses that do not comply with the regulations of this Code shall
be subject to the provisions of Article VI of this Code relating to non-
conformities.
   C.   General Prohibition. No structure, no use of any structure or land, and
no lot of record or zoning lot, now or hereafter existing, shall hereafter be
established, enlarged, extended, altered, moved, divided, or maintained in any
manner, except as authorized by the provisions of this Code and except in
compliance with the regulations of this Code. Without limiting the foregoing,
any such activity that would cause any existing structure not to comply with
this Code or that would create any parcel of land that could not be developed
in compliance with this Code shall be prohibited.
   D.   Exempt Uses. The following utility uses are exempt from the provisions
of this Code: poles, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals, pipes, mains,
and valves and postal boxes or equipment cabinets not larger than 50 inches in

special use permit. (July, 19, 2012)
   E.   Laws and Ordinances. This Code is not intended to repeal, abrogate,
annul, or otherwise impair or interfere with any existing provision of law or
ordinance or any rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued
pursuant thereto, relating to the use of buildings or premises, now in force
and effect in relation thereto; provided, however, that where the regulations
of this Code are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements
than such existing provision of law or ordinance or any rules, regulations, or
permits, the regulations of this Code shall govern.
   F.   Easements and Agreements. This Code is not intended to abrogate, annul,
or otherwise interfere with any platted building lines, easements, covenants,

covenants, or other private agreements or legal relationships, the regulations
of this Code shall govern.
8-102 APPLICATION TO VARIATIONS AND SPECIAL USES
   A.   Existing Variations and Special Uses. Any variation or special use
permit approval lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this Code, or
any amendment to it, shall be deemed to be and continue valid after such
effective date subject to any conditions placed thereon at the time of
issuance. Any structure or use lawfully authorized by any such variation or
special use permit that could not be so issued after such effective date shall
be subject to the provisions of Article VI of this Code dealing with non-
conformities.
   B   Existing Uses and Structures Newly Requiring Special Use Permit. The
owners of any use or structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this
Code, or any amendment to it, that did not, prior to such effective date,
require a special use permit but which, after such effective date, does require
a special use permit, may continue such use or maintain such structure by
securing therefore a certificate of zoning compliance pursuant to the standards
and procedures of 7-301 of this Code. Unless and until such a permit is so
secured, such use shall be subject to the provisions of Article VI of this Code
dealing with non-conformities.
8-103 BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED PRIOR TO EFFECTIVE DATE
   A.   New Code Shall Apply. All work, structures, and uses authorized by
building permits issued prior to the effective date of this Code or any
amendment to it shall not be affected by this Code. Except as provided in
Subsections B and C of this Section, no certificate of zoning compliance shall
be issued following the effective date of this Code or any amendment to this
Code unless the work, structure, or use for which the certificate is sought is
made to comply fully with the applicable provisions of this Code or any such
amendment.
   B   Right To Complete Construction Pursuant To Approved Plans. Nothing in
this Code, or any amendment to it, shall be deemed to require any change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any structure if:
   A building permit for such structure was lawfully and properly issued prior
to the effective date of this Code or any such amendment to it, such permit had
not by its own terms expired prior to such effective date, and construction
pursuant to such permit is commenced prior to the expiration of such permit; or
   A building permit application was on file with the Village Building
Department and complete in all material respects prior to the effective date of
this Code.
   C.   Right To Occupy As Nonconformity. Upon completion pursuant to
Subsection B of this Section, such structure may be occupied by, and a
certificate of occupancy shall be issued for, the use designated on such
permit, subject thereafter, to the extent applicable, to the provisions of
Article VI of this Code relating to non-conformities.
8-104 PENDING APPLICATIONS
   A.   New Code Shall Apply. This Code, and any amendment to it, shall apply
to all applications pending and not yet finally decided on the effective date
thereof to which it would apply if such applications were filed on or after
such effective date; provided, however, that nothing in this Code shall be
deemed to require any change in any proposed plat of subdivision that has been
granted preliminary plat approval by the Board of Trustees prior to such
effective date, and provided further, however, that this Code shall not apply
to any zoning variation application that was on file with the Village and
complete in all material respects prior to such effective date, which zoning
variation application shall be processed in accordance with the standards and
requirements that were in effect on the date such application was filed.
   B.   Duty Of Village Manager. Within 30 days following the effective date of
this Code, or any amendment to it, the Village Manager shall inform each
applicant to which this Code applies that said application is subject to the
provisions of this Code, as amended, and will be processed in accordance
therewith; that the applicant may within 30 days following the mailing of such
notice re-file, without additional fee, its application on the basis of this
Code, as amended; and that if the applicant does not so re-file, its
application may be denied for noncompliance with the provisions of this Code,
as amended.
   C.   Duty Of Applicant. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection B of
this Section, it shall be the responsibility of each applicant having an
application pending on the effective date of this Code, or any amendment to it,
to modify such application in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Code, as amended, and the failure to do so, whether or not the procedures of
Subsection B have been followed, may result in denial of such application for
failure to comply with this Code, as amended. Any modification or refiling of
an application pending on such effective date in order to comply with the
provisions of this Code, as amended, shall be permitted at any time prior to
the final disposition of such application and shall be permitted without
payment of any additional fee.
   D.   Processing of Pending Applications. Upon the re-filing of any pending
application as herein provided, or upon notification from the applicant that it
will not re-file or modify its application, or upon the expiration of 60 days
following the effective date of this Code or any amendment to it, whichever
occurs first, such pending application shall be processed in accordance with
the terms of this Code, as amended; provided, however, that the application
requirements, hearing requirements, and procedural requirements set forth in
Article VII of this Code shall not apply to any such pending application and
each such application shall be processed in accordance with the application,
hearing, and procedural requirements that were in effect on the date such
application was filed. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection,
the Village Manager shall have the authority to request additional data,
information, or documentation for pending applications when, in his or her
judgment, such additional data, information, or documentation is necessary or
appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of such pending
application.
8-105 REPEAL OF PRIOR PROVISIONS
   The Glencoe Zoning Ordinance, as adopted by ordinance dated May 9, 1921, and
as amended from time to time thereafter prior to the adoption of Ordinance No.
92-33-1899 providing for the comprehensive revision of said Zoning Ordinance by
the adoption of this Code shall be, and they are hereby, repealed in their
entirety. Except as expressly provided in this Code, such repeals shall not
affect or impair any act done, offense committed, or right accruing, accrued,
or acquired, or liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred prior to
the time such repeal takes effect, but the same may be enjoyed, asserted,
enforced, prosecuted, or inflicted as fully and to the same extent as if such
repeal had not been effected.
8-106 SEVERABILITY
   A.   Intent as to Severability. The several provisions of this Code shall be
severable in accordance with the following rules:
      1.   Provisions Declared Invalid. If any court of competent jurisdiction

WRITTEN INTERPRETATIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS
   VILLAGE OF GLENCOE
   MEMORANDUM
   TO: Zoning Code Amendment
   FROM: John Houde, Deputy Director of Public Works/
   Community Development
   DATE: August 20, 1996
   SUBJECT: R-D multiple Family Number of Stories and Building Height
Interpretation
   This memo is written as an interpretation based on the previous and current
Zoning Code of Village staff interpretation for number of stories and building
height restrictions in the R-D multiple family district for at least 20 years.
   Multiple family construction is limited to 2 stories. Any cellar (what most
people might consider a basement) must have an average ceiling height under 3.5
feet above grade (grade is the natural grade on the lot or top of sidewalk
depending on my review of the particular site). This lower level cellar has
typically been used for a lower level garage such can be seen in the townhouse
construction at 314 Hawthorn (built in 1979), 966-972 Greenbay (built in 1987),
and 91-101 Linden at Glencoe Road (built in 1989).

   MEMORANDUM

   FROM: John Houde, Deputy Director of Public Works/
   Community Development
   DATE: February 25, 1997
   SUBJECT: Ceiling Measurements for Basement/Cellars and F.A.R.
   This memo is written as an interpretation based on an interpretation since
1990 of how ceiling measurements are made for F.A.R. and the basement/cellar
calculations. The ceiling of any space will be measured to the bottom of the
structural floor or ceiling supports such as floor joists or roof rafters.
Several examples are provided as illustrations. For a home, measurements as to
whether a basement/cellar is counted in F.A.R. will be made to the bottom of
the first floor joists. Other interpretations such as occasional steel or wood
beams, ventilation system ducts, etc., will not be included in this
measurement. Similarly, in reinforced concrete floor construction the basement/
cellar or other ceiling height measurements will be to the underside of the
concrete floors not to the artificial dropped ceiling below. These methods of
measuring apply for both F.A.R. calculations and for determining the definition
requirements of basements and cellars. The overall philosophy of Zoning Code
requirements is to restrict height or volume above grade and this
interpretation follows this goal.

   MEMORANDUM
   TO: Zoning Code Attachment
   FROM: John Houde, Deputy Director of Public Works/
   Community Development
   DATE: Effective May 15, 1999
   SUBJECT: F.A.R. Measurements for Room Areas 5 Feet or More High.
   This memo is to clarify and provide a more detailed interpretation of an
element of our floor area ratio requirement as it applies to attic areas over
dwelling areas and roof areas next to or part of dwelling areas of a house.
   Attic areas above dwelling areas will continue to be included or excluded as
previously detailed in our F.A.R. handout. Spaces next to or part of occupied
areas of the house that are 5 feet or more high will now be included in F.A.R.
calculations even if interrupted by cross ties or truss structural members.
   Below are common design examples that will now be affected by this
interpretation review:
      1) Area above one story attached garage next to second floor of a house.
Unfinished or finished areas 5 feet or more high are now included in F.A.R.
calculations.
      2) Third floor habitable room located next to under roof areas. Under
roof areas 5 feet or more high will be included in F.A.R. calculations even if
interrupted by cross ties or truss structural members.
      3) Cape Cod or Tudor-style houses with usable or unusable roof areas next
to habitable rooms. Areas over 5 feet or more high inside or next to these
rooms will be included in F.A.R. calculations.
   We encourage you to let us review any design questions you have on any of
these F.A.R. requirements before submitting final drawings for permit issuance.
   Preliminary design cross sections can be faxed to us at 847-835-4234.

   SUBJECT: F.A.R. Bonuses For Attached Garages
   This memo is to elaborate on the attached garage bonus in Section
3-111-G-12-(6) of the Zoning Code. All of the attached garage space on a home
must be located in the rear half of the lot in order to qualify for this first
200 square feet exclusion bonus from F.A. R. Calculations. This clarification
has been part of our Floor Area Ratio handout since 1999.

   MEMORANDUM
   TO: Zoning Code
   FROM: John Houde, Deputy Director of Public Works/Community Development
   DATE: October 11, 2006
   SUBJECT: Clarification of Attached Garage Requirements     
   This memorandum clarifies the Village’s interpretation of zoning
requirements related to attached and detached garages applied for, for the past
20+ years. Section
3-111-F of the Zoning Code requires a minimum space of 10 feet between
principal and accessory structures and uses. For instance, 10 feet of
separation is required between a residence and a detached garage. In order for
a garage to be considered attached, a minimum 3-foot wide connection between
garage and residence is required. The connection must be 7 feet or taller in
height and covered with a flat or pitched roof. An open trellis or arbor
structure does not meet this requirement. The area under the roof is not
required to be enclosed and may be open to the elements.
   VILLAGE OF GLENCOE
   MEMORANDUM
   TO: Zoning Code
   FROM: John Houde, Deputy Director of Public Works/Community Development
   DATE: January 2007
   SUBJECT: Clarification of 6-103 Nonconforming Structures and Demolition of
existing homes on lots that are nonconforming in width or area    
   This memorandum sets forth the Village’s staff longstanding interpretation
of Section
6-103 regarding Non-Conforming Structures. This interpretation extends as far
back as at least 1955. The Zoning Board of Appeals followed this interpretation
in connection with 475 Greenleaf, and it has been affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Cook County and the Illinois Appellate Court for the First District in the
case of R. Eden Martin et al. V. Zoning Board of Appeals, et al., No. 05 CH
7885 (Cir. Ct.) and No. 05-3743 (App. Ct.)
   According to this interpretation, a lot that may be legally nonconforming in
some respect shall be treated as a Nonconforming Structure under the Zoning
Code if it had been lawfully improved with
a structure. In addition, the original Nonconforming Structure can be removed
and replaced either in the same location or in a different location on the same
lot so long as the new structure either:
         (a)   fully conforms with the Zoning Code requirements for bulk,
height, setbacks, and the like (except for those requirements that cannot be
satisfied because of characteristics of the lot itself that are nonconforming,
such as lot size or lot dimensions), or
         (b)   the new structure shares in part the same foot print as the
original structure and is only nonconforming to the same extent as the original
structure (e.g., both the original and replacement structure extend into a side
yard by two feet).
   The replacement structure cannot, however, increase the degree of
nonconformity of the original structure, nor may it include a new nonconforming
element, unless appropriate zoning relief is granted.
VILLAGE OF GLENCOE
MEMORANDUM
TO: Zoning Code Attachment
FROM: John Houde, Building & Zoning Administrator
DATE: May 7, 2013
SUBJECT: Public street frontage requirements for a subdivision of two or more
lots from one zoning lot
Different elements of the Zoning Code and Subdivision Ordinances imply, but do
not clearly state, the longstanding Village interpretation since the 1950's
that a subdivided vacant lot or larger subdivision of lots must provide
frontage on a public-dedicated street. Section 31-3.9 of the Subdivision
Ordinance additionally states under "Lot Access and Circulation,""All
subdivisions shall be designed to provide appropriate public street access to
all lots in the subdivision." The minimum public street frontage is 20 feet as
noted in Section 8-302 of the Zoning Code definition under "Lot Line, Front."
This memo is to clearly note this requirement, which more often becomes a
question on the subdivision of an existing house lot into two or more lots
located on the small number of remaining private streets in the Village.
