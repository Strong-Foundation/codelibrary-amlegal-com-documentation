1-5A-20: CONDUCT CODE:
   A.   Purpose: The public expects the highest standards of professional
conduct from the village president/trustees elected to local government. The
purpose of the conduct code is to establish guidelines for the ethical and
interpersonal conduct of the village president/trustees. The village president/
trustees are answerable to the community through democratic processes, and the
conduct code will assist in providing for the good government of the village.
   B.   Standards Of Conduct: Village president/trustees shall uphold the law
at all times to:
      1.   Seek to advance the common good of the village as a whole while
conscientiously representing the communities they serve;
      2.   Perform the functions of office truly, faithfully and impartially to
the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with the following core
values:
         a.   Integrity: Giving the village interests absolute priority over
private individual interests.
         b.   Honesty: Being truthful and open.
         c.   Objectivity: Making decisions based on a careful and fair
analysis of the facts.
         d.   Accountability: Being accountable to each other and the public
for decisions taken.
         e.   Leadership: Confronting challenges and providing direction on the
issues of the day.
      3.   Uphold the conduct code as a means of promoting the standards of
behavior expected of the village president/trustees and enhancing the
credibility and integrity of the board in the broader community.
   C.   Village President/Trustees Responsibilities:
      1.   Conduct To Be Observed: Village president/trustees are agents of the
public whose primary objective is to address the needs of the citizens. As
such, they are entrusted with upholding and adhering to the ordinances and
resolutions of the village as well as all applicable state and federal laws. As
public servants, the village president/trustees must observe a high standard of
ethical conduct in their official duties and faithfully fulfill the
responsibilities of their offices, regardless of their personal or financial
interests.
      2.   Dedicated Service: The village president/trustees should faithfully
work toward developing programs to address the needs of the citizens in the
course of their duties. The village president/trustees should strive to perform
at a level which is expected of those who work in the public's interest.
      3.   Conduct At Meetings: Village president/trustees shall respect the
colleagues, staff and members of the public present during board meetings or
other proceedings of the village. Meetings shall provide an environment for
transparent and healthy debate on matters requiring decision making.
      4.   Refrain From Attacking A Trustee's Motives: When a question is
pending, a trustee can condemn the nature or likely consequences of the
proposed measure in strong terms, but he must avoid personalities, and under no
circumstances can he attack or question the motives of another trustee. The
measure, not the trustee, is the subject of debate. If a trustee disagrees with
a statement by another in regard to an event that both witnessed, he cannot
state in debate that the other's statement "is false". But he might say, "I
believe there is strong evidence that the trustee is mistaken". The moment the
chair hears such words as "fraud", "liar", or "lie" used about a trustee in
debate, he must act immediately and decisively to correct the matter and
prevent its repetition.
   D.   Interpersonal Behavior: Village president/trustees shall treat every
person, including other trustees, employees, individuals providing services on
a contract for service, and the public with dignity, understanding and respect
and ensure that their work environment is free from discrimination, bullying
and harassment.
   E.   Community Representation:
      1.   The village president/trustees shall observe a high standard of
professionalism when representing the village and in their dealings with
members of the broader community.
      2.   All committee members will accurately and adequately communicate the
attitudes and decisions of the committees and village board, even if they
disagree with the majority decision of the committee or village board.
   F.   Governmental Relationships: The village president/trustees recognize
the importance of working constructively with other levels of government and
organizations in Germantown Hills and beyond to achieve the goals of the
village.
   G.   Sexual Harassment Policy:
      1.   The Village President and Board of Trustees shall be bound by the
Village's sexual harassment policy, subject to the provisions of Section
1-5A-20.G.2 of this Code.
      2.   Alleged harassment by the President or a Trustee against another
elected official can be reported to the Village President. If the Village
President is the reporting person, or is implicated by the allegation, or the
reporting person is not comfortable reporting to the Village President, then
the report can be made to any Trustee, or the Village Administrator. Any report
under this section must be referred to the Village's legal counsel, who then
must appoint a qualified independent attorney or consultant to review and
investigate the allegations. (Ord. 657, 6-24-2010; amd. Ord. 822, 1-16-2020)

abatement which may occur for a violation of this chapter, the village may
proceed in Woodford County circuit court (or any other court of competent
jurisdiction) to enjoin, abate, correct, or prohibit continued further
violations or threatened violations of this chapter.

time provided in the notice, the village may cause the abatement or removal of
such nuisance, as permitted by law.

regardless of any seven (7) day period or such other time as may be specified
in the notice to abate or required by law; provided, however, that for
abatements under item 1 above, such officer shall have first applied for and
obtained the written permission of the village president or other village
officer duly in charge for such summary abatement.
   G.   Costs A Lien: If the village removes any nuisance in accordance with
this chapter, the person who caused the nuisance to exist or the owner of the
property shall be liable to the village for the reasonable cost thereof;
provided, that where specifically authorized in this chapter or by law, the
village may take steps to perfect and enforce a lien against the property, or
may institute proceedings to collect the cost, or both. The lien shall be
superior to all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes, as
permitted by law. Upon payment of the cost of removal of the nuisance after

amount of twenty-one dollars ($21.00) per household unit per month, beginning
on November 1, 2023. The collection fee shall be payable monthly as billed by
the village or its billing agent. A penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added
to all bills not paid by the last day of the month in which the bill is sent.
Failure to pay the fee upon billing by the village or its billing agent may
result, at the village option, in the placement of a lien against the real
estate and/or the filing of a complaint in circuit court seeking personal
judgment against the owner or person interested in the property subject to the
collection fee, plus court costs and reasonable attorney fees, or such other
remedies as may be available to the village. The village hereby imposes an
additional charge for recording a notice of lien in the amount actually charged
by the office of the county recorder of deeds, and an additional charge of
twenty five dollars ($25.00) for each insufficient funds check to pay for
additional administrative expenses. The election of a particular remedy shall
not constitute a waiver of any other remedy available to the village for
collection of the fee. The owner of the household unit, the occupant thereof,
and the user of the services shall be jointly and severally liable to pay such
collection fee, and the services are furnished to the household unit by the
village only on the condition that the owner of the household unit, occupant
thereof, and user of the garbage and refuse service are jointly and severally
liable. The village, through its contractor, shall provide municipal waste
collection service to the household unit at least once each week and collection
of recyclable wastes that have been separated from garbage or refuse on a
biweekly schedule. (Ord. 653, 3-11-2010; amd. Ord. 772, 10-24-2016, eff. 11-1-

the village, the village shall, before abating the nuisance, obtain the consent
of the person served with the notice to abate or an order from the Woodford
County circuit court or any other court of competent jurisdiction authorizing

transporting the vehicle from one place of storage to another. When loading,
unloading or transporting any such vehicle as authorized by this subsection B8b

end, the ground at the upstream end shall be sloped from the new surface
drainage swale to the existing surface drainage swale with a slope not steeper
than three feet (3') horizontal per each vertical foot. The ground on the
downstream side of the downstream inlet structure, if no adjoining underdrain
exists, shall be similarly sloped. If a downstream inlet structure between two
(2) driveways, as shown on exhibit B attached to the ordinance codified herein,
and sufficient space exists between the inlet structure and the downstream
driveway to accommodate the required slope, then the underdrain leading from
the inlet structure shall be connected to the existing downstream driveway
culvert, and the entire area between the driveways shall be filled and graded
so that the surface of the inlet structure grate is flush with the new surface
drainage swale. (Ord. 175, 3-27-1980)
   D.   All areas disturbed in the course of construction shall be repaired to
their original condition, and all waterways shall be hand raked and seeded as

buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or
other purposes situated within the village and abutting on any street, alley,
or right of way in which there is now located or may in the future be located
any public sanitary (or combined) sewer of the village is hereby required, at
his expense, to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such
facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, within ninety (90) days after date of official
notice to do so; provided, that said public sewer is within three hundred feet
(300') of the property line. (Ord. 221, 12-1-1983)
   E.   Connection For Annexed Property: Unless otherwise agreed to by the
village and the property owner, property annexed to the village shall connect
to the village's public sewer within five (5) years after the date on which

(Ord. 770, 9-26-2016)
7-2-5: CONNECTION CHARGES:
   A.   Established: Pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-150-1,
there is hereby established a connection charge for connection to the sewerage
system of the village in the amounts specified in this subsection. The
connection charge is imposed on and is assessed against all owners and users of
real property, jointly and severally, who constitute new or additional users of
the sewerage system. To the extent and in the manner provided by law, the
connection charge shall be a lien on the affected real property.
      1.   Residential Connections: The amount of the connection charge
applicable to residential connections shall be two thousand five hundred
dollars ($2,500.00). A "residential connection" is defined as a connection to a
"residential user", which term is defined in section
7-2-1 of this chapter under "user types".
      2.   Nonresidential Connections:
         a.   The amount of the connection charge applicable to nonresidential
connections shall be in the same proportion to the two thousand five hundred
dollar ($2,500.00) residential connection charge as the actual or projected use
of the sewage plant capacity by the particular nonresidential user bears to the
use of the sewage plant capacity by an average residential user, as determined
by water usage records; provided, however, that the nonresidential connection
charge shall in no event be less than two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500.00). In the case of a nonresidential user with an established history
of water usage, the superintendent of public works shall calculate the
connection charge in accordance with the formula above. In the case of a
nonresidential user without an established history of water usage, the
superintendent of public works shall estimate and project the water usage for
calculation of the connection charge in accordance with the formula above. In
that event, after water usage figures have been established for a period of a
year, the connection charge shall again be calculated and an additional charge
collected from the nonresidential user, or an amount refunded to the
nonresidential user, depending on application of the formula above. (Ord. 244,
8-21-1986; amd. Ord. 669, 10-14-2010; 2012 Code)
         b.   A "nonresidential connection" is defined as a connection to a
"commercial user", an institutional or governmental user, or an "industrial
user", all of which are defined in section
7-2-1 of this chapter under "user types".
   B.   Use Of Revenues: In accordance with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-
150-1, connection charges collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used by
the village for its general corporate purposes in relation to the sewerage
system, with primary application thereof being made by the necessary expansion
of the works of the system to meet the requirements of the new users thereof.
(Ord. 244, 8-21-1986; amd. 2012 Code)
   C.   Charge Is Additional: The connection charge established and imposed by
this section is in addition to all other fees and charges established by this
chapter, including the permit and inspection fee described in subsection
7-2-6A3 of this chapter, and including the wastewater service charges described
in section
7-2A-3 of this chapter.
   D.   Payment Prerequisite To Building Sewer Permit Issuance: The connection
charge established by this section must be paid before issuance of the building
sewer permit described in subsection
7-2-6A of this chapter. (Ord. 244, 8-21-1986)

7-2-8-5: MEASUREMENTS, TESTS AND ANALYSES:
   A.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
   B.   The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed
by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village, but no less than once per
year, the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and
local standards are being met.
   C.   The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory
analyses to the village at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the
village. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and
reporting required by the village. At such times as deemed necessary, the
village reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
outside laboratory service.
   D.   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA division of laboratories "Manual Of
Laboratory Methods", and shall be determined at the control manhole provided,
or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. (Ord. 221, 12-1-1983)
7-2-8-6: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
No statement contained in this section
7-2-8 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of
unusual strength or character may be accepted by the village for treatment,
subject to payment therefor, in accordance with article A of this chapter, by
the industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance with federal
and state guidelines for user charge system. (Ord. 221, 12-1-1983)
7-2-9: EXCESS STORMWATER AND SUMP PUMP DISCHARGES:
   A.   Short Title: This section shall be known as the EXCESS STORMWATER AND
SUMP PUMP DISCHARGE ORDINANCE OF GERMANTOWN HILLS, ILLINOIS.
   B.   Definitions: For the purpose of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning:
    DRY BOTTOM DETENTION BASIN: A facility designed to be normally dry and
maintained with a grass vegetative cover that will contain water only when
excess stormwater runoff occurs. Earthen type dry bottom stormwater detention
basins shall have a concrete paved channel or pipe capable of conveying low
flow through the basin and, where necessary, a system of underdrains to prevent
soggy areas. The embankments around any earthen type detention basin or swale
shall have a slope of no greater than four to one (4:1), horizontal to
vertical, to allow for safe and easy mowing.
   EXCESS STORMWATER: That portion of stormwater runoff from a specific
watershed at a specified rainfall frequency which exceeds the transportation
capacity of natural drainageways or the runoff from the area in its natural
undeveloped state. Excess stormwater includes subsurface as well as surface
runoff. Excess stormwater typically includes roof runoff and runoff from
nonporous surfaces.
   NATURAL DRAINAGEWAYS: Channels formed in the existing surface topography
prior to changes made by unnatural causes.
   NATURAL UNDEVELOPED STATE: The condition of the existing surface topography
and vegetative cover of a parcel of land prior to any development having
occurred, with the exception of typical agricultural practices.
   STORMWATER DETENTION FACILITY: An area designed and designated to store
excess stormwater. A stormwater detention facility may include a dry bottom
detention basin or a wet bottom detention basin.
   25-YEAR STORM: A 25-year storm would have an intensity of rainfall which
would, on the average, be equaled or exceeded only once in twenty five (25)
years. This does not imply that it will occur only once in twenty five (25)
years or, having occurred, will not happen again for twenty five (25) years.
   WET BOTTOM DETENTION BASIN: A facility designed to be maintained as a pond
with a free water surface, and which has capacity to contain excess stormwater
runoff. A wet bottom detention basin must have a minimum normal water depth of
four feet (4') and shoreline protection to prevent erosion from wave action.
The embankments around the detention basin shall have a slope of no greater
than four to one (4:1), horizontal to vertical, to allow for safe and easy
mowing.
   C.   Prohibitions:
      1.   Discharge Upon Streets And Sidewalks: No person, firm or corporation
shall discharge, or allow to be discharged, any excess stormwater or water from
a sump pump upon a paved public street or sidewalk.
      2.   Discharge Upon Neighboring Properties: No person, firm or
corporation shall discharge, or allow to be discharged, any excess stormwater
or water from a sump pump upon property owned by another person or entity.
      3.   Accumulation Or Pooling: No person, firm or corporation shall
discharge, or allow to be discharged, any excess stormwater or water from a
sump pump in such a manner as to allow water to accumulate or pool on the
surface of the land, or to accumulate or pool in any ditch or depression.
Nothing in this subsection C3 shall be construed as preventing the use of
detention ponds or other reasonable means to control water runoff or erosion.
Nothing in this subsection C3 shall be construed as prohibiting natural
wetlands.
   D.   Duty To Take Corrective Action: No person, firm or corporation, having
discharged or having allowed to have been discharged, any excess stormwater or
water from a sump pump, roof runoff or subsurface drainage upon a public
street, right of way or sidewalk, shall fail to take all reasonable corrective
action to prevent or mitigate harm or damage to the public street, right of way
or sidewalk, or the users of said public street, right of way or sidewalk. At a
minimum, required mitigation shall include, but is not limited to, promptly
salting the area of water discharge to prevent the accumulation of ice, or to
melt any such accumulation of ice which may have already occurred, should the
discharge occur or should water accumulate or pool during any period of
freezing temperatures. The failure to take corrective action, as required by
this subsection, is a separate and distinct offense from any discharge in
violation of subsection C1, C2 or C3 of this section.
   E.   Defenses:
      1.   It shall be no defense that the person, firm or corporation does not
own the property from which a discharge of excess stormwater or water from a
sump pump originates (either in whole or in part), if the person, firm or
corporation has control over said property.
      2.   It shall be a defense to an alleged violation of subsection C1, C2
or C3 of this section if a developed property from which a discharge of excess
stormwater originates contains one or more stormwater detention facilities
designed to provide sufficient storage volume to detain excess stormwater
produced by a 25-year rainfall event from the developed drainage area for any
and all durations. Nothing in this subsection E2 shall be deemed as allowing
the purposeful discharge of sump pump water upon a paved street, sidewalk or
property owned by another. (Ord. 654, 3-25-2010)
   F.   Violations, Penalties And Enforcement:
      1.   Notice Of Violation: If any person, firm or corporation violates
this section, the village may send notice to correct the violation. The notice
may issue from the superintendent of public works, any subordinate of the
superintendent of public works, the village attorney, or any other person
designated by the village president. The notice may be delivered by certified

subject to prosecution for violating this section, and shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or
continues.
      3.   Injunction: In addition, the village may make application to the
circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this section or make
such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this
section.
      4.   Recovery Of Costs: The village shall be entitled to recover from any
person, firm or corporation violating this section all costs connected with any
enforcement activity, including court costs, reasonable attorney fees and the
fees of any private collection agents retained by the village attorney.
      5.   Remedies Cumulative: The above remedies are cumulative, not
exclusive, and are in addition to any other remedies provided by law or
ordinance.
   G.   Interpretation: This section is in addition to all other ordinances on
the subject and shall be construed therewith excepting as to that part in
direct conflict with any other ordinance, and in the event of such conflict,
the provisions of this section shall govern. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as repealing the prohibitions and penalties for the discharge of
certain water into the village sanitary sewer system in this chapter. (Ord.
654, 3-25-2010)
7-2-10: DAMAGE TO, TAMPERING WITH SYSTEM:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, wilfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which

7-2A-1: BASIS FOR CHARGES; SURCHARGE:
The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance, plus replacement, a debt service charge, and a
surcharge, if applicable.
   A.   Basic User Charge:
      1.   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter (250 mg/l).
      2.   The basic user charge shall consist of operation and maintenance
costs, plus replacement, as follows, and shall be computed as shown in
subsection 7-2A-4A of this article: (Ord. 282, 6-28-1990; amd. 2012 Code)
         a.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to pay for the
fixed costs to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities for the year,
including a replacement fund for the year. Fixed costs are those that would be
payable even if there were no flow, or very low flow, of sewage through the
system.
         b.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to pay for the
variable costs to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities for the year,
using such flow information as is available to estimate the projected flow of
sewage through the system. Variable costs are those that are payable as a
result of sewage flow through the system.
         c.   Establish a minimum charge estimated to raise sufficient revenue
to pay for the projected fixed costs for the year by dividing the projected
fixed costs by the number of users. Through further divisions, the minimum
charge for each billing period can be computed.
         d.   Establish a user rate based on sewage flow through the system
estimated to raise sufficient revenue to pay for the projected variable costs
for the year, using such flow information as is available. The user rate shall
be applied to each one hundred (100) gallons of water consumption in excess of
a very low flow level established for each user in calculating the minimum
charge. (Ord. 282, 6-28-1990)
   B.   Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge shall be computed by
dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding bonds by the number of
users. Through further divisions, the debt service charge for each billing
period can be computed as a fixed charge.
   C.   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastes exceed
the normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge
will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters
for all wastes which exceed the two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) and
two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/L) concentration for BOD and SS,
respectively. Subsection 7-2A-4B of this article specifies the procedure to
compute a surcharge. (Ord. 282, 6-28-1990; amd. 2012 Code)
7-2A-2: MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
   A.   The "billing year", for purposes of the flow calculations identified in
this section, shall begin each July 1 and shall end the following June 30.
   B.   Unless otherwise noted, the volume of flow used for computing basic
user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water usage as read by
Caterpillar Trail Water District to the lowest even increment of one hundred
(100) gallons.
   C.   The monthly metered water usage calculations for each billing year for
most users shall be the average of the preceding three (3) month winter period
for which the user's home or business water meter is read by Caterpillar Trail
Water District, beginning in the months of November, December or January. (For
example, the monthly metered water usage calculations for billing year 1987-88
shall be the average of the water meter readings for the 3 month periods
beginning in the months of November 1986, December 1986, or January 1987.)
   D.   The monthly metered water usage calculations for each billing year for
users whose water meters are read monthly by Caterpillar Trail Water District
shall be the average of the preceding winter months of December, January and
February. (For example, the monthly metered water usage calculations for
billing year 1987-88 shall be the average of the water meter readings for the
months of December 1986, January 1987, and February 1987.)
   E.   The monthly water usage calculations for each billing year for
residential users who: 1) do not receive water from Caterpillar Trail Water
District; 2) have not yet established a record of water usage during the
relevant three (3) month water meter reading period; 3) are determined by
Caterpillar Trail Water District to have damaged or inaccurate water meters; or
4) for any other reason have no water meter reading during the relevant three
(3) month water meter reading period, shall be the average monthly metered
water usage for all residential users whose water meters were read by
Caterpillar Trail Water District during the relevant three (3) month water
meter reading period. Residential water meter readings for properties which
were vacant for at least one month during the relevant three (3) month water
meter reading period shall be excluded in calculating the average usage
described in this subsection.
   F.   The monthly water usage calculations for each billing year for
commercial, institutional, governmental or industrial users who fall within the
exceptions identified in subsection E of this section shall be determined by
special arrangement between the user and the Board of Trustees in an effort to
estimate the likely monthly water usage, taking into account all information
relating to comparable uses within or without the Village, and all other
relevant information gathered by the Board of Trustees or submitted by the
user. In the event the user and the Board of Trustees fail to agree on a
special arrangement, the determination of the Board of Trustees based on
information gathered or submitted shall be binding.
   G.   The Village has determined that computation of the basic user charges
and surcharges based on an average of the relevant three (3) month winter water
meter reading periods identified in this section will avoid charging users for
unsewered water used to fill swimming pools, water lawns, etc. If a user
contends, however, that he has substantial unsewered water usage during the
relevant three (3) month winter water meter reading periods identified in this
section, he can apply to the Board of Trustees for an appropriate adjustment.
Such a user must be prepared to present to the Board qualitative and verifiable
evidence that he is using water for purposes that do not result in any impact
on the wastewater facilities of the Village. Evidence of unsewered water usage
of less than five hundred (500) gallons per month will not be considered to be
substantial and will not be considered appropriate for an adjustment. (Ord.
245, 8-21-1986)
7-2A-3: CHARGES ESTABLISHED:
   A.   Basic User Charges: There shall be and there are hereby established

(Ord. 245, 8-21-1986)
   B.   Surcharge: The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges
shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Superintendent of Public Works and
shall be binding as a basis for surcharges. (Ord. 245, 8-21-1986; amd. 2012
Code)
7-2A-4-1: CONNECTION MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR CHARGE:
If, as determined by the Village's Superintendent of Public Works (or the
Village President in his stead), any connection to the Village's sanitary sewer
system: a) after installation, fails to comply with the standards set forth in
any applicable ordinance or State or Federal law; b) by reason of disrepair or
lack of maintenance, no longer complies with the standards set forth in any
applicable ordinance or State or Federal law; c) fails to operate in a manner
as described in the permit for its installation, or otherwise deviates from its
permitted use; or d) by virtue of present or imminent failure, threatens to
fail and/or threatens damage to the Village's sanitary sewer system, then the
Village's Superintendent of Public Works (or the Village President in his
stead) shall serve the owner of property responsible for the sewer connection
with written notice that the sewer connection is required to be maintained or
repaired. No special form of the notice is required, and the notice may be
served in any manner reasonably likely to provide actual notice to the owner,
but said notice shall be reasonably specific in describing the work which must
be performed by the property owner, and the notice shall provide the property
owner at least thirty (30) days to complete such work at his or her own
expense. Should the property owner fail to complete all work within the time
specified in the notice, the village shall be permitted to enter upon land and
perform all necessary work, repairs or maintenance. The village's expenses for
the work, repairs or maintenance shall be billed to the property owner,
appearing on the property owner's bill as the "connection maintenance and
repair charge", and the village may collect said bill and charge, using all
procedures and remedies permitted under this article. For purposes of this
section, a "connection" includes, but is not limited to, any lateral line
connecting toilet facilities to the village's sanitary sewer system. (Ord. 709,
10-11-2012)
7-2A-5: AUDIT OF CHARGES:
The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by
certified public accountants for the village in their annual audit report. The
wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in
debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs, including
replacement costs. (Ord. 282, 6-28-1990)
7-2A-6: BILLS, PENALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES:
   A.   Monthly Bills: Rates and charges for service established in this
article shall be payable each month.
   B.   Liability For Service: The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof,

the service to such premises, and the service is furnished to the premises by
the village only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant
and user of the services are jointly and severally liable therefor to the
village.
   C.   Rendition Of Bills; Due Date; Late Payment Penalty: Bills for sewer
service shall be sent out to arrive during the first week of each monthly
billing period. All sewer bills are due and payable by the last day of each
monthly billing period. A penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added to all
bills not paid by the last day of each monthly billing period, e.g., bills sent
during the first week of July will be subject to a penalty of ten percent (10%)
if not paid by July 31.
   D.   Notice Of Lien Charge; Insufficient Funds Charge:
      1.   The village hereby imposes an additional charge for recording a
notice of sewer lien in the amount actually charged by the office of the county
recorder of deeds, and an additional charge of twenty five dollars ($25.00) for
each insufficient funds check, to pay for additional administrative expense.
      2.   If an owner/occupant delivers two (2) insufficient funds checks
payable to the village during any twelve (12) month period, then that owner/
occupant must make all further payments to the village either in cash or
through the use of the electronic pay system operated at the direction of the
village. The village will not accept checks from any such owner/occupant until
such owner/occupant has made timely noncheck payments to the village for a
period of at least one year. (Ord. 703, 6-14-2012)
7-2A-7: DELINQUENT PAYMENTS; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE; RECONNECTION:
   A.   Delinquent Payments: If the charges for such services are not paid by
the last day of the month a bill is sent, the account shall be considered
delinquent, and the village, in addition to any other remedies provided herein,
may sue to recover the delinquent charges, penalty, additional charges stated
in section
7-2A-6 of this article, fine, costs and attorney fees.

wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
         If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the
Village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
         If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at the Village Hall, 216 Holland Rd, Germantown Hills, IL 61548.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
         A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the
type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public
safety agency's communications equipment.
         Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based
on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy
the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Collocation Location: The wireless provider shall not collocate
small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
         However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Compliance With Public Safety Regulations: The wireless provider
shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations
that concern public safety.
      6.   Compliance With Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply
with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative
utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements
that are set forth in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the
Village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to
other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a
historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this subsection C, a
wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities
on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
         New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in section
9-3A-4 of this Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing
utility poles or wireless support structures.
      2.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      3.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      4.   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights- of-way, for:
         a.   Routine maintenance;
         b.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with subsection B1d of this section; or
         c.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   E.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
         For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning
given to that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in
this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: a)
to obtain a franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or
video service or b) to obtain any required permission to install, place,
maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless
facilities subject to this chapter.
   F.   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
         A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on
the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the
Village makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small
wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the
collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application
submitted two (2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by
notifying the Village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The
existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination
provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has
collocated on the Village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to
the Village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its
option under this paragraph.
   G.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
         If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct
costs, the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day
after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of
intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   H.   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
         The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
         A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it
sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
Village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider. (Ord. 805, 6-21-2018)
7-4-4: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
The Circuit Court of Woodford County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
Village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal
utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 805, 6-21-2018)
7-4-5: INDEMNIFICATION:
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against any
and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right- of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability. (Ord. 805, 6-21-2018)
7-4-6: INSURANCE:
   A.   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      1.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      2.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      3.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to
the collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self- insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage limits required by the Village. (Ord. 805, 6-21-2018)

8-2-3: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
This chapter shall apply to:
   A.   All projects within the corporate limits of the village. No land
surface shall be disturbed unless an erosion and sediment control permit (see
section
8-2-7 of this chapter) or an erosion, sediment and stormwater control permit
(see section
8-2-8 of this chapter) has first been issued for that project, except as
follows:
      1.   Land disturbing activities which do not involve the construction of
any new single- or two-family dwellings and for which the disturbed area is
less than five hundred (500) square feet; or
      2.   Normal agricultural practices; or
      3.   Routine maintenance of roads and utility service lines.
      The erosion control administrator reserves the right to require any
nonagricultural construction development activity, regardless of disturbed area
or type of activity, to comply with this chapter if it is determined to be the
cause of or a contributor to an existing or potential erosion, sediment or
stormwater impact.
   B.   Any land within the corporate limits of the village on which there is
located a permanent stormwater control measure which was installed pursuant to
this chapter. (Ord. 607, 4-24-2008; amd. Ord. 841, 6-17-2021)
8-2-4: STANDARDS FOR DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE:
Standards for design and maintenance of control measures for soil erosion,
sediment and stormwater are as follows:
   A.   Erosion And Sediment Control Measures: All control measures required by
this chapter shall conform to the design criteria, standards, and
specifications provided in the applicable standards referenced in section
8-2-14-2, attachment B of this chapter, now in effect or as hereafter amended
or measures deemed acceptable by the erosion control administrator or designee.
All control measures installed shall be sufficient to prevent sediment from
leaving the permit site during a 5-year frequency storm event. Measures shall
be taken to prevent sediment from leaving the site. When sediment does leave
the site, the owner, developer or contractor shall remove the sediment within
four (4) hours, or by no later than the end of the workday. For example,
installing a rock construction drive or cleaning tires could be used to
minimize tracking of sediment onto public roads.
   B.   Permanent Stormwater Control Measures:
      1.   All development shall provide water quality treatment for runoff
from increased impervious areas to minimize impacts of post-development
stormwater runoff on water quality. The development shall provide non-
structural BMPs and volume control for runoff to meet the requirements as
indicated below:
         a.   Non-Structural BMPs: All developments shall include a minimum of
two (2) non-structural BMPs. Examples of BMPs that may be considered for
developments are:
            (1)   Natural vegetation buffers;
            (2)   Preservation of existing streams, channels and drainage ways;
            (3)   Preservation of existing wetlands, prairies, and floodplains;
            (4)   Minimization of disturbance of steep slopes (greater than 3:
1);
            (5)   Minimization of impervious surfaces; and
            (6)   Maximize preservation of existing forested area. Removal of
undergrowth and preservation of large trees (greater than six (6) inches) is
encouraged.
         b.   Volume Control: Volume control practices shall be designed to
control the first inch of runoff from the impervious area of development on the
site. Retention-based practices with quantifiable storage capacity shall be
sized to retain and infiltrate the required volume. Practices include, but are
not limited to: infiltration trenches, infiltration basins, porous pavement,
bio retention systems, dry wells, open channel practices fitted with check
dams, retention storage below the outlet of a detention facility and
constructed wetlands that have quantifiable storage. Existing soil conditions
within the village limit the infiltration capacity. All infiltration methods
shall include an underdrain system. See Attachment C Technical Guidance For
Volume Control.
      2.   All stormwater controls shall be designed so that the peak discharge
rate from the permitted area resulting from the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-
year and 100-year critical duration storm events for the post-project condition
do not exceed the corresponding storm event peak discharges for the pre-project
condition or a cropland equivalent for straight row crops with crop residue
greater than twenty percent (20%) and good hydrologic condition, whichever is
less. The velocity of the post-project peak discharge rate from the above noted
design storms shall not exceed the corresponding storm event peak discharges
for the pre-project condition.
   C.   Regional Stormwater Control Systems: To allow for the beneficial
development and maintenance of regional stormwater management systems, where
they are available and appropriate, an applicant may submit a design dependent
on such a system. The applicant shall submit documentation of the approval for
the use of the regional stormwater management facility from the governmental
agency having jurisdiction thereover. The applicant shall submit evidence
showing that there will be no adverse flooding impact to any receiving stream
between the point of discharge and the regional stormwater facility. If the
applicant is approved to use the regional stormwater management system, the
applicant may request from the erosion control administrator exemption from the
requirements in this section for permanent on site stormwater controls. Such
exemption shall not apply to any temporary stormwater control measures required
by this chapter. (Ord. 607, 4-24-2008; amd. Ord. 841, 6-17-2021)
8-2-5: MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Erosion, Sediment And Temporary Stormwater Control Measures:
      1.   On site sediment control measures shall be constructed and
functional prior to initiating any land disturbing activity, clearing, grading,
stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
      2.   Sediment control measures and temporary stormwater control measures
are to be maintained so they are operating effectively until permanent ground
surface protection and permanent stormwater control measures are established in
a manner specified in the applicable permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
      3.   Fully functioning temporary sediment control measures (including,
but not limited to, perimeter sediment controls) shall remain in place until
the ground is stabilized with permanent ground cover. The intent of this
chapter is to keep the sites protected at all times until the ground is
permanently stabilized. In cases where it is not practical to leave the
temporary sediment control measures in place prior to establishing permanent
ground cover (for example, when control measures need to be removed in order to
grade the area or install pavement or sod), an exception will be made only if
one of the following conditions will be met. In no way does adhering to one of
the following conditions relieve the owner of responsibility to clean up or
repair any damages caused from sediment or stormwater runoff leaving the site.
         a.   Permanent ground cover shall be established with pavement,
aggregate or sod within three (3) days of the removal of sediment barriers.
         b.   Permanent vegetation shall be established by seeding with
anchored mulch within three (3) days of removal of sediment barriers during the
spring or fall seeding periods. However, on project areas with slopes not
exceeding five percent (5%), permanent vegetation shall be established by
seeding within three (3) days of the removal of sediment barriers during the
spring or fall seeding periods. Summer seeding is acceptable on project areas
which shall be watered. This does not apply to concentrated flow areas.
   B.   Additional Control Measures: The erosion control administrator may
require additional control measures pursuant to the standards if determined as
necessary after site inspection.
   C.   Permanent Stormwater Control Measures: An operation and maintenance
(O&M) plan shall be developed by the site owner. The O&M plan shall clearly
establish the operation and maintenance necessary to ensure the proper
functioning of all permanent stormwater control facilities. The O&M plan shall
be submitted with the stormwater control permit application and include (at a
minimum) the following items:
      1.   Annual inspection of the stormwater facilities. To assure proper
implementation of BMPs, maintenance and care stormwater BMPs should be
inspected by a qualified person, which may include the landowner, or the
owner’s designee.
      2.   Removal of silt from all permanent structures which trap silt or
sediment in order to keep the material from building up in grass waterways,
pipes, detention or retention basins, infiltration structures, or BMPs, and
thus reducing their capacity to convey or store water.
      3.   Re-establishment of vegetation of scoured areas or areas where
vegetation has not been successfully established.
      4.   Plan for removal and replacement of any underdrain system every ten
(10) years (or sooner).
   D.   If deficiencies within the storm water control measures are identified,
the village shall notify the owner. The owner shall have thirty (30) days to
correct the deficiencies. Municipality shall then conduct a subsequent
inspection to ensure completion of the repairs. If, after an inspection by the
municipality, the condition of a stormwater control facility presents an
immediate danger to the public health or safety because of an unsafe condition
for improper maintenance, the municipality shall take such action as may be
necessary to protect the public and make the facility safe. Any cost incurred
by the municipality shall be assessed against the owner(s). (Ord. 607, 4-24-
2008; amd. Ord. 841, 6-17-2021)
8-2-6: RETROFITTING PRESENTLY DEVELOPED SITES:
In instances where the project involves a presently developed site, the
applicant may request an exemption from fully complying with the stormwater
control requirements. The erosion control administrator shall determine the
type and extent of compliance required based on existing and proposed site
conditions and the impact of stormwater runoff on the surrounding area. This
exemption will only be granted in cases where the proposed condition of the
site will not be significantly different from the existing condition as
determined by the erosion control administrator. The purpose of this section is
to allow for alterations to presently developed sites without a major redesign
of the existing (or nonexisting) stormwater system, while assuring that all
projects will be moving closer to compliance with the stormwater control
requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 607, 4-24-2008; amd. Ord. 841, 6-17-2021)

8-2-14-1: ATTACHMENT A, STANDARDS FOR STORMWATER DESIGN ANALYSES:
   ATTACHMENT A
   VILLAGE OF GERMANTOWN HILLS
   STANDARDS FOR STORMWATER DESIGN ANALYSES
The following are the minimum standard methods and procedures to be used to
comply with the stormwater design requirements of this chapter. If an applicant
determines that different methods are necessary based on site specific
conditions, the applicant must request approval from the erosion control
administrator to use other methods prior to submittal.
The design methods listed below are readily available in a number of computer
programs, including the soil conservation service's TR 20 (SCS), and WinTR-20
HEC1 and HEC-HMS or other municipally approved program. Additionally, a
simplified methodology which is based on the use of these methods is available
in TR 55 (SCS, 1986). TR 55 can be applied using either manual computations or
a computerized version.
   Rainfall Depth And Duration/Intensity Data
      Use data for Woodford County (Illinois state water survey, Bulletin 75).
   Storm Event Rainfall Runoff
      Use the SCS runoff curve number method to determine rainfall runoff depth
for the critical duration storm. Soil type information is available from the
SCS Woodford County soil survey, 1992.
   Storm Distribution (Cumulative Rainfall Versus Time)
      Rainfall should be distributed use the appropriate Illinois state water
survey circulare 173 Huff rainfall distrubution (Huff, 1990). Except that SCS
Type II distribution is acceptable with TR-55.
      Use the SCS dimensionless hydrograph. See SCS (1974) for information
regarding this procedure.
      As a substitute for detailed hydrograph analysis, TR 55 (SCS, 1986) can
be used, either manually or computer program.
   Storage Routing (Detention Pond Analysis)
      Use the continuity equation, also known as the modified-Puls and storage
indication methods. As a substitute for detailed storage routing of a
hydrograph, TR 55 (SACS, 1986) can be used, either manually or computer
program. If TR 55 is used and a detention basin with a two-stage outlet control
structure including a rectangular weir and/or orifice outlet is included as
part of the control measures, use the attached detention basin outlet worksheet
to determine and present the structure design information. (Ord. 607, 4-24-
2008; amd. Ord. 841, 6-17-2021)
8-2-14-2: ATTACHMENT B, EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL CRITERIA AND
SPECIFICATIONS:
   VILLAGE OF GERMANTOWN HILLS EROSION AND
   SEDIMENT CONTROL CRITERIA AND SPECIFICATIONS
There are three ways to accomplish urban soil erosion and sedimentation
control:
   •   Allow erosion to take place and then control sediment before it leaves a
site.
   •   Stop erosion in the watershed (project area), by soil stabilization or
run off control measures.
   •   A combination of the two (most desirable).
The following is a list of common measures that can be used to control erosion
and sediment. It is by no means an exhaustive list. Some standard drawings are
included in this attachment. Additional drawings, standards and specifications
can be found in the Illinois Urban Manual, IEPA and USDA, NRCS, 1995 and the
Illinois Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And Sediment Control, The Urban
Committee Of The Association Of Illinois Soil And Water Conservation Districts,
Revised July 1988.
SEDIMENT CONTROL
   A.   Perimeter Sediment Control Measures: To be installed between disturbed
areas (including stockpiles) and property lines or drainageways in order to
protect off site areas. Control measures should be installed on the down slope
sides of the disturbed areas where runoff will leave the site.

SOIL STABILIZATION
(Recommended seeding dates for Central Illinois are shown in bold.)
   A.   Vegetative Soil Cover:
1) Temporary Seeding: Provides a temporary quick cover to control erosion when
permanent seeding is not desired or the time of year is inappropriate. (Early
spring - September 30)
2) Permanent Seeding: Provides permanent vegetative cover to control erosion,
filters sediment from water. May be part of final landscape plan. (Spring
seeding: early spring - May 15) (Fall seeding: August 1 - September 10)
3) Dormant Seeding: Same as permanent seeding except seeding is done during
dormant season. Higher rates of seed application are required. If no mulch is
applied, then perimeter controls should be maintained until the vegetation is
established. (November 15 - March 1)
4) Sodding: Quick, permanent cover to control erosion. Quick ways to establish
vegetative filter strip. Can be used on steep slopes or in drainageways where
seeding may be difficult. (Anytime, except when ground is frozen.)
5) Ground Cover: Provides ground cover, shrubs and trees in addition to
permanent vegetation. May be used as part of a final landscape plan along with
shrubs and trees.
   B.   Nonvegetative Soil Cover:
1) Mulching: Added insurance of a successful temporary or permanent seeding.
Controls unwanted vegetation and preserves moisture. Provides cover where
vegetation cannot be established.
2) Aggregate Cover: Provides soil cover on roads and parking lots and areas
where vegetation cannot be established. Prevents mud from being picked up and
transported off site.
3) Paving: Provides permanent cover on parking lots, roads or other areas where
vegetation cannot be established.

REQUIREMENTS:
   ATTACHMENT C
   VILLAGE OF GERMANTOWN HILLS
   TECHNICAL GUIDANCE FOR MEETING VOLUME CONTROL
   REQUIREMENTS
Volume Control Practices Overview
   Volume control practices utilize designated infiltration areas or structures
to capture a portion of stormwater runoff (i.e., the volume control storage)
and retain it onsite such that the runoff is able to: 1) percolate through (or
into) the underlying soils; 2) evaporate; 3) dissipate through
evapotranspiration by plants; or 4) drain back slowly into the minor system via
underdrains. The process of percolating runoff through the soil is an effective
mechanism for both site runoff volume reduction and pollutant removal.
Pollutants such as fine sediment, nutrients, bacteria, and organic materials
can be filtered, absorbed by soil particles, or utilized by plants, thus
providing a water quality benefit.
Site Feasibility Assessment
   A site feasibility assessment that examines site limitations is necessary to
determine the appropriate approach for volume control practice design. Volume
control practices should be located on soils that are significantly permeable
to ensure that the captured volume of runoff can infiltrate and dewater the
structure at a minimum rate of 0.5 inches per hour. Other considerations, such
as the groundwater table and discharge of volume control practice overflows,
should be examined and used in the design. Installing retention based volume
control practices within a floodway is prohibited due to the risk of washout
from deep and swift flood waters in these flood prone areas.
Soil Suitability
   Retention-based practices require soils with appropriate infiltration
capacity. The infiltration rate is strongly influenced by the proportion of
sand, silt, and clay (texture). Predominately clay soils have infiltration
rates that are too low (in inches per hour) to accommodate the volume of volume
control practices and predominately sandy soils can infiltrate runoff too
rapidly and adversely impact groundwater. In addition to infiltration capacity,
the soils must be free of contaminants, which can also adversely impact
groundwater. Therefore, sites with contaminated soils are not suitable for
volume control practices.
   Onsite soils must be tested in order to determine if they are appropriate
for volume control practices. Testing must include a determination of the soil
type(s) and the infiltration capacity, including the capacity of the soils at
the base of the structure.
   Soil borings or pits should be taken in the location of the proposed volume
control practice to verify soil particle size distribution (textural class) and
to determine the depth to groundwater and bedrock. The number of soil borings
should be selected as needed to determine soil conditions. The minimum depth of
the soil borings or pits must be five feet (5') below the bottom elevation of
the proposed volume control practice. This serves the purpose of determining
the location of the seasonally-high groundwater table. Infiltration tests
should be conducted at the proposed bottom elevation of the volume control
practice. The infiltration rate must be measured with a double-ring
infiltrometer and meet the requirements of ASTM D3385. For sites where the
double-ring infiltrometer test is impractical, the single-ring infiltrometer
test may be used, provided that the testing follows the procedure contained on
Page 28 of the City of Chicago Stormwater Ordinance Manual (March 2014).
   Soils must have sufficient infiltration capacity to accept the volume
control storage. The infiltration range of onsite soils for volume control
practices should be between 0.5 and 2.41 inches per hour. These restrictions
limit the use of volume control practices to soils with textures of sandy loam,
loam, silt loam, silt, most sandy clay loams, and only some clay loams and
silty clay loams.
   In the event that a natural depression is proposed to be used as a volume
control practice, the applicant must demonstrate the following information:
      1.   Infiltration capacity of the soils under existing conditions
(inches/hour);
      2   Existing drawdown time for the high water level (HWL) and a natural
overflow elevation; and
      3.   Operation of the natural depression under post-development
conditions mimics the hydrology of the system under pre-development conditions.
   Poor infiltration rates (< 0.5 inches/hour) are common in the Village of
Germantown Hills and do not prevent the use of retention-based practices. If
onsite soils do not provide a suitable infiltration rate, the design of the
volume control practice should incorporate the use of an underdrain system. As
described in the next section, only certain site constraints (contaminated
soils or high groundwater levels) are acceptable reasons for not providing
retention-based practices.
Contaminated Sites
   There are sites, such as those previously used as gas stations or sites with
known contaminants (based on a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment), where it
would be impractical to use retention-based practices. For these sites, the
volume control requirements can be met by providing flow-through practices or a
reduction in impervious area.
Groundwater Analysis
   An investigation into the location of the seasonally-high groundwater table
must be carried out in order to avoid groundwater contamination. In combined
sewer areas, the seasonally-high groundwater table must be at a minimum of
three and a half feet (3.5') below the bottom of the proposed volume control
practice to allow for treatment of collected runoff prior to it entering the
groundwater system (two feet (2') in separate sewer areas). If soil borings or
pits do not show the seasonally-high groundwater table to be within 3.5 (or 2)
feet of the bottom of the proposed volume control practice, then further
investigation is not required.
   For instances where the seasonally-high groundwater table is within three
and a half (3.5') (or two (2)) feet of the bottom of the proposed volume
control practice, then the proposed volume control practice must be relocated
or redesigned such that a minimum of three and a half (3.5) (or two (2)) feet
is maintained.
Volume Control Practices for Site Development
   The Village Ordinance requires that volume control practices must be sized
to retain and/or infiltrate the volume control storage. The volume control
storage is equal to one inch (1") of runoff from the impervious surfaces of the
development. The volume control practices can include:
      Infiltration Trenches*
      Infiltration Basins*
      Porous Pavement (storage in the voids below the pavement)
      Bio-Retention Systems*
      Dry Wells
      Open Channel Practices Fitted With Check Dams*
      Storage Below the Outlet of a Site Detention facility*
      Constructed Wetlands that have Forebays, Deepwater Zones, and Micropools
   As discussed above, pretreatment measures to protect the functionality of
volume control practices are required where necessary. The volume control
practices marked with an asterisk (*) will usually require pretreatment. A
summary of the pretreatment measures that may be used for various volume
control practices is shown below:

void space of aggregate. The aggregate layer may be incorporated into a number
of practices ranging from infiltration trenches to porous pavements. Many
volume control practices are in the form of reservoirs filled with coarse
aggregate with no outlet beneath a vegetated depressional area (such as with
bio-retention systems). When coarse aggregate is used, the capacity of the
reservoir is determined by the void space of the coarse aggregate used in the
system. If the infiltration rate of the underlying soil is less than 0.5
inches/hour, an underdrain must be used to drain the accumulated volume of
runoff.
   There can be a great deal of flexibility in the types of practices selected
as well as the location and configuration of these practices onsite. For
example, the dimensions (length, width, and depth) of these practices can be
manipulated such that they can take on irregular shapes, thereby allowing for
easier integration into the site design, such as along property lines, in
parking lot islands, or unusable portions of the site. Additionally,
underground storage can be provided using the stone voids under permeable
pavement, and other systems can be designed to function below impervious areas.
Volume Control Practice Sizing and Drainage Criteria
   Calculate Required Volume Control Storage
   Determine the portion of the volume control storage that will need to be
treated with volume control practices. The volume control storage is equal to
one inch (1") of runoff from the impervious surfaces of the development. This
volume is best represented in cubic feet.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1288.png]
   The dimensions of the volume control practices will be a combination of the
depth and surface area available to retain the volume control storage. In order
to minimize the footprint of the practice, the allowable depth is often the
limiting factor. The maximum allowable depth is determined by the depth
necessary to maintain a three and a half (3.5') foot separation from the
seasonally high groundwater level, bedrock, or other limiting layer (three and
a half (3.5') feet in combined sewer areas, two feet (2') in separate sewer
areas). The surface area of the volume control practice is determined using the
design volume and final depth values.
   All volume control practices must have quantifiable storage space to retain
the calculated volume control storage. Depending on the volume control
practice, the storage volume may consist of surface storage, storage in the
voids of growing media, and/or storage in the void space of aggregate.
   The capacity of an aggregate-filled reservoir to retain the volume control
storage should be based on the volume of void space (% porosity) of the coarse
aggregate used in the system, where the volume of voids is equal to the volume
control storage. If test data is not available, use thirty-six percent (36%)
porosity for the coarse aggregate. The size of an aggregate-filled reservoir
can be computed by converting the volume control storage to reservoir volume:

IMAGES/0-0-0-1290.png]
   Perforated underdrain is required for each volume control retention-based
practice due to the region's typical clayey soils where infiltration rates are
assumed to be low. In most cases, a required underdrain should be no larger
than 4-inches in diameter to encourage retention, have an observation well
installed at the terminal end, be spaced no more than thirty feet (30') on
center across a retention field area, and laid with the perforations on the
bottom of the pipe. Void volume credit available below the invert of the
perforated underdrain must be limited to no more than 12-inches and will be
credited at one hundred percent (100%) toward volume control requirements. Void
volumes below the underdrain invert must extend across the entire volume
control storage system, and not limited to only an underdrain trenched area.
Void volume above the invert of the underdrain up to the ground surface will be
deducted by a factor of fifty percent (50%) to account for losses out of the
underdrain. When calculating the storage volume in aggregate a void volume of
0.36 is used. A void ratio of 0.25 is used for growing media.
   Volume provided above the ground surface will be limited in depth to 12-
inches of wetland ponding and credited at one hundred percent (100%). For
calculating surface volume control storage, the average end area method between
the ground elevation and the elevation of the overflow grate/outlet pipe/check
dam is recommended. Wet ponding depths above one foot (1') of depth are not
considered volume control and are considered impervious areas.
   For more information, see the volume control practice details located in
MWRD Technical Guidance Manual (TGM), Appendix C. The complete Manual is
available at: http://www.mwrd.org/irj/go/km/docs/_documents/MWRD/internet/

Technical_Guidance_Manual.htm
   If high infiltrating soils are suspected, provide a detailed soils report
documenting the additional in situ percolation tests to confirm actual
infiltration rates and to allow for design of a volume control facility without
underdrains and take credit for additional infiltrative release.

Volume Control Practice Figure - Surface Storage, Media Storage and Aggregate
Storage
   Volume Control Practice Site Location
   Determine how volume control practices will fit into the development site
design (on available pervious area of the development), and select the
appropriate volume control practice. Information collected during the site
feasibility assessment should identify the potential for multiple volume
control practices versus relying on a single volume control practice. Again,
volume control practices should be located on soils that are significantly
permeable to ensure the captured volume control storage can infiltrate and
dewater the structure at a minimum rate of 0.5 inches per hour. If these soils
don't exist on site, then an underdrain should be included in the design.
   The following should be considered when determining the location of volume
control practices:
      1.   Conveyance path of the runoff to the practice;
      2.   Overland flow path from the practice to the main drainage system;
      3.   Practices should be a minimum of ten feet (10') from a building
foundation (unless waterproofed), twenty feet (20') from a sanitary sewer, and
one hundred feet (100') from potable water wells and septic tanks;
      4.   Practices should not be installed on slopes greater than fifteen
(15);
      5.   Practices should not be installed above soils that are considered
fill; and
      6.   A minimum setback of twenty feet (20') from a road's gravel shoulder
is required to ensure that the practices do not cause frost heaving.
   Volume Control Storage Design
   The volume control practice should be filled with coarse aggregate that
meets IDOT Section CA-7 quality and gradation. Other types of coarse aggregate
will be permitted, provided that it is crushed angular stone that is clean and
washed free of fines. A void ratio of 0.36 is used when calculating the storage
volume in aggregate. For growing media, a void ratio of 0.25 applies. A layer
of choking stone or filter fabric must separate the growing media from the
coarse aggregate, and/or sand layers. No filter fabric shall be placed along
the bottom of the trench between the volume control media and the native
subsoil. Filter fabric must wrap along the trenching sides to prevent soils
migration from clogging the system. The filter fabric should meet the
requirements of the Illinois Urban Manual Material Specifications 592 for
geotextile fabric.
   The storage reservoir should have direct access for maintenance activities.
An observation well (e.g., a perforated PVC pipe that leads to the bottom of
the structure) is needed to enable inspectors to visually monitor the drawdown
rate of the water. For more information, see the observation well detail
located in the MWRD Technical Guidance Manual (TGM), Appendix C. One well per
40,000 ft2 of practice surface area is required. Where infiltration rates of
the soil are less than 0.5 inches per hour, volume control practices must
incorporate an underdrain pipe that will allow the structure to be dewatered
within seventy-two (72) hours or less, if the structure becomes clogged. An
underdrain can be a perforated pipe system in a gravel bed, installed at the
base of the structure (minimum of two inches (2") and maximum of twelve inches
(12") from the bottom) to collect and remove filtered runoff. The period of
inundation is defined as the time from the high water level in the practice to
one to two inches (2") above the bottom of the facility. This criterion was
established to provide:
      1.   Wet-dry cycling between rainfall events;
      2.   Unsuitable mosquito breeding habitat;
      3.   Suitable habitat for vegetation;
      4.   Aerobic conditions; and
      5.   Storage for back-to-back precipitation events.
   Additional details and specifications for the design of volume control
practices are provided in this article and in the MWRD Technical Guidance
Manual (TGM), Appendix C:
      Underdrain
      Coarse aggregate
      Filter fabric
      Monitoring well
      Turf fields
   Overflow Path From Volume Control Practice
   In addition to a conveyance design that routes flows to a volume control
practice, an equally important consideration is a conveyance design that routes
flows from the practice back to the main drainage system. The overflow path is
a necessary component designed to prevent structural damage to the volume
control practice from localized flooding in the event that the practice does
not dewater fast enough to prevent an overflow. Overflows can occur as a result
of clogging or during long-duration, high-intensity storm events that raise the
groundwater level to an elevation that impedes infiltration. Therefore,
overflow designs should route excess flows through a stabilized discharge point
that allows these flows to be directed back to the main drainage system in a
controlled manner that will not cause scour.
   Protection Of Volume Control Facilities During Construction
   Volume control practices are susceptible to failure during construction and
therefore it is important that staging, construction practices, and erosion and
sediment control practices all be considered during their installation. To
protect the long-term functionality of volume control practices, the following
measures should be addressed in the construction sequencing, general notes,
and/or soil erosion and sediment control plan for a development:
      Volume control practices should be installed toward the end of the
construction period.
      The contributing drainage area must be stabilized prior to the
installation of the volume control practice.
      Soil compaction shall be minimized as much as possible during site
grading. Appropriate measures (such as fencing) should be used to prevent heavy
construction equipment traffic from accessing the area.
      Volume control facilities must be protected with a double-row of silt
fence (or equivalent measure) during construction. The two (2) layers of silt
fence should be placed at least five feet (5') apart and must follow the
Illinois Urban Manual standards.
      In general, volume control facilities should not be used as temporary
sediment traps during construction. For sites where this is not practicable,
special construction notes and/or details are required to protect the
functionality of the facility.
Protection Of Volume Control Practice Infiltration Capacity: Pretreatment
   Pretreatment is critical for runoff entering volume control practices in
order to prevent clogging within the volume control practice. This reduces
maintenance and also provides an added level of protection against groundwater
contamination. Pretreatment of runoff entering a volume control practice is
strongly recommended to protect the functionality of the structure. Where
practicable, flow-through practices such as vegetated swales or filter strips
should be used to meet the pretreatment requirement. Additionally, upland
drainage should be properly stabilized both during and after construction to
reduce erosion, thus minimizing the sediment loads being delivered to the
structure. The use of trash racks or downspout screens will also satisfy the
pretreatment requirements in some cases, as these measures prevent debris from
clogging the volume control practice. (Ord. 841, 6-17-2021)

other standards appearing in this chapter or the Village zoning ordinance:
   A.   Hazardous Signs:
      1.   If, in the opinion of the Zoning Officer, any sign becomes hazardous
to pedestrian or vehicular traffic by reason of, but not limited to,
deterioration, damage, obstruction of walkways or fire access or exit lanes,
restriction of sight distances for vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or its
location so close to travel lanes or parking areas that it is struck by
maneuvering vehicles, then such sign shall be relocated, removed, or protected
by the owner, agent, or person having beneficial use of the premises or lot
within ten (10) days of notification by certified letter from the zoning
officer that such hazard exists.
      2.   If, in the opinion of the zoning officer, the condition or location
of the sign presents imminent danger to the public, it shall be removed or
corrected by the owner, agent, or person having beneficial use of the premises
or lot promptly upon receipt of written notice from the zoning officer. Any
aggrieved business owner may seek review of the zoning officer's ruling by the
village board.
   B.   Signs To Be Durable:
      1.   All new signs shall be constructed from materials that are durable
and weatherproof. These materials include high impact plastics with fade
resistance, wood treated in such a manner as to retain color and strength, wood
that is naturally resistant to weathering such as cedar and redwood, brick and
other masonry materials, aluminum and associated alloys resistant to visible
corrosion, painted steels with baked on finish, and other corrosion resistant
steels.
      2.   Vinyl signs shall have minimum weight of sixteen (16) ounces per
square yard, minimum tensile strength of 270/270 pounds, and minimum tear
strength of 75/85 pounds. Lettering for vinyl signs shall be either of vinyl
pressure sensitive material or transparent vinyl material. Structural support
for vinyl signs shall be one inch (1") square aluminum or galvanized steel
tubing; electrical conduit is not permitted for vinyl sign supports.
      3.   Signs should be constructed to avoid degeneration over time, to
withstand weather, and to require little or no maintenance. Signs shall be
constructed in such a way as to maintain proper alignment both level and plumb.
Signs shall not become misaligned due to frost conditions, and masonry signs
shall have adequate footings to prevent damage due to frost.
      4.   Broken panels, missing letters, flaking or peeling paint and other
visual damage to a sign shall be repaired within forty five (45) days of
occurrence or within thirty (30) days of notification by certified letter from
the zoning officer, whichever occurs first.
      5.   The sign's owner may seek review by the village board of the zoning

   C.   Illuminated Signs: Illuminated signs shall be subject to the following
standards:
      1.   No signs designated as permitted in an agricultural or residential
district, or actually existing in such a district, may be illuminated, except

be extinguished no later than the later of: a) the time of business closing; or
b) between eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. and five o'clock (5:00) A.M.; provided,
that this shall not prohibit continuous illumination of permitted flags,
subdivision signs, vending machine signs and directional signs.
      4.   All illumination devices shall be designed to be weather resistant
and shatter resistant.
      5.   The use of unshielded lights, including incandescent light bulbs
strung on poles, wires, or any other type of support, to illuminate signs is
prohibited. Whenever external illumination is used for a sign, the source of
light shall be located, shielded, and directed in such a manner that the source
is not directly visible from any public street or private residence. In no case
shall the lighting intensity of any sign, whether resulting from internal or
external illumination, exceed seventy five (75) foot-candles when measured with
a standard light meter perpendicular to the face of the sign at a distance
equal to the narrowest dimension of the sign face.
      6.   a. Allowable area for an illuminated attached, ground, gas station
price or pole sign shall be increased by ten percent (10%) if the sign is an
internally illuminated sign as described in subsection C6b of this section.
This increase shall not be counted towards the maximum sign area allowed in the
aggregate sign display calculation under this chapter.
         b.   Internally illuminated signs shall permit light to shine fully
through only the lettering and graphic elements of the sign. The background for
such lettering and graphics shall be opaque or translucent and shall transmit
light at a level substantially less than that transmitted through the lettering
and graphics.
   D.   Signs Shall Not Obstruct: All signs shall be located so as to not
obstruct vision at an intersection or a vehicular entry or exit from the lot on
which the sign is located. No sign shall be erected, constructed or maintained
so as to obstruct a fire escape, exit, window or door opening used as a means
of egress. Nor shall any sign be attached in form, shape or manner such that it
will interfere with any opening required for ventilation. However, this
subsection will not prevent a sign from being erected in front of or covering a
transom window when not in violation of the provisions of the building or fire
prevention regulations that may apply.
   E.   Setbacks: All signs shall be set back at least ten feet (10') from
property lines unless specifically exempted in this chapter. Directional signs
shall not be subject to the ten foot (10') restriction, except at corners.
   F.   Landscaping: All ground, pole, or other signs or sign structures that
originate from or otherwise touch the ground shall be appropriately landscaped
so as to blend with the surrounding area.

      1.   All signs, except those attached flat against the wall of a
building, shall be constructed to withstand wind loads as follows:
         a.   For solid signs, thirty (30) pounds per square foot on one face
of the sign.
         b.   For skeleton signs, thirty six (36) pounds per square foot of the
total face area of the letters and other sign surfaces, or ten (10) pounds per
square foot of the gross area of the sign as determined by the overall
dimensions of the sign, whichever is greater.
      2.   The wind loadings quoted in subsection G1 of this section are normal
averages and must be adjusted for areas subject to unusually high velocity
winds, for signs of extraordinary height or wind tunneling effects created by
large buildings.
      3.   Further, no sign shall be suspended by chains or other devices that
will allow the sign to swing due to wind action. Signs shall be anchored to
prevent any lateral movement that would cause wear on supporting members or
connections.
   H.   Compliance With Applicable Regulations: All signs shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, other
applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance and building and electrical
requirements promulgated by the village. (Ord. 688, 7-21-2011)

In addition to the general requirements, restrictions or other provisions of
this chapter, the following standards, restrictions and conditions shall be
applicable to the signs listed herein:
   A.   A-Frame Sign:

shall be referred to herein as an “AFS”. “Operator” signifies the operator of a
particular business within a building located on a commercially zoned property.
      2.   An AFS shall meet the following requirements:
         a.   Only one AFS is permitted per business, although each business
located in a building containing two (2) or more businesses may have an AFS.
(If more than 1 business operates within a single business premises, i.e., a
premises accessed by single front entrance, only 1 AFS is permitted for the
business premises, although the operators of each business within the premises
may jointly apply for a permit for the AFS and may share space on the AFS.)
         b.   An AFS shall be no wider than three feet (3') and no taller than
five feet (5') from the top of the sign structure to the surface upon which it
is placed.
         c.   An AFS shall not be located off premises.
         d.   An AFS shall be located no greater than twenty feet (20') from a
front entrance to the business premises it advertises, and shall not be located

business it advertises.
         f.   An AFS shall either be secured down or sufficiently weighted so
as not to blow out of position, or shall be removed whenever weather conditions
might make it susceptible to blowing out of position.
         g.   An AFS shall not be externally illuminated; provided, that an AFS
shall not be considered to be externally illuminated if a fixture attached to a
building or under a canopy, for example, but which is not specifically directed
at the AFS, happens to cast light on the AFS.
         h.   An AFS shall not count against the allowable square feet of
signage otherwise permitted by this chapter.
         i.   An AFS may have advertising on each side of the AFS. The operator
may change the advertising on the AFS as often as he/she sees fit, so long as
the AFS is used as stated in the definition of an AFS in section
8-3-4 of this chapter.
      3.   The right to display an AFS is extended to operators. Operators are
responsible for securing AFS permits and for otherwise assuring compliance with
this chapter. An operator shall only be required to secure an AFS permit one
time for any particular AFS. Once issued, an AFS permit shall be of unlimited
duration, so long as the AFS is used in conformity with the AFS policy.
   B.   Apartment Identification Signs:
      1.   Sign shall not exceed twenty four (24) square feet in area;
provided, that the sign structure shall not be included when determining sign

      3.   Sign shall not exceed a height of twenty five feet (25').
      4.   No more than three (3) attached signs per frontage shall be
permitted for a single business or for each business located within a single

      6.   Signs within Ballfield shall face inward towards field. No sign
shall be permitted on the reverse, facing outward from the field.
      7.   Signs within Ballfield are excluded from the general restriction of
subsection C4 of this section.
   D.   Banner Signs And Temporary Signs: Banner signs and temporary signs
shall be referred to herein collectively as "B/TS", and both types of sign are
subject to the following standards:
      1.   For purposes of this subsection regarding B/TS, "owner" signifies
the owner of a business property, which includes the land and any buildings.
"Operator" signifies the operator of a particular business within a building
located on a business property.
      2.   A B/TS may be freestanding. If so, the B/TS can be mounted no higher
than four feet (4') from the ground and can be no longer than fifteen feet
(15') or fifteen percent (15%) of the wall space to which it is adjacent. A
freestanding B/TS may not be located off premises. The specific location(s) for
freestanding B/TS shall be specified in the permit application and must be
approved by the reviewing zoning officer. The location(s) must be set back at
least ten feet (10') from any property line and must not create a traffic
hazard by reason of limited visibility or otherwise. A B/TS must be mounted
securely. A B/TS shall not be attached to a utility pole or utility structure.
      3.   A B/TS may be attached to a building. If so, it can be a maximum of
three feet (3') high by ten feet (10') long or fifteen percent (15%) of the
wall space to which it is adjacent, and cannot be mounted so as to extend
higher than the roofline of the building. The specific location(s) on the
building shall be specified in the permit application and must be approved by
the reviewing zoning officer. A B/TS attached to a building must be mounted
securely.
      4.   A B/TS may be externally illuminated.
      5.   A B/TS shall not count against the allowable square feet of signage
otherwise permitted in this chapter.
      6.   The right to display B/TS is extended to owners. Owners are
responsible for securing B/TS permits and for otherwise assuring compliance
with this chapter, not only for themselves and their businesses, if any, but
for all operators and their businesses. Owners may designate an agent to act on
their behalf with respect to B/TS matters, but the owners remain responsible.
If an owner wishes to designate an agent to deal with B/TS matters, the owner
must inform the Zoning Officer of that designation in writing, providing all
contact information for the agent.
      7.   If an owner's building contains two (2) or more operators, it is the
owner's responsibility to allocate among the operators opportunities for them
to display B/TS, consistent with the requirements of the B/TS policy, and to
apply for B/TS permits on behalf of the operators, and to assure the operators'
compliance with the B/TS policy, including abiding by all permit requirements.
The Village will not be in the business of mediating disputes among owners and
operators, or among various operators, concerning any perceived "unfairness" in
the allocation of opportunities to display B/TS. Finally, consistent with the
owner's ultimate responsibility, if an operator violates any B/TS policy, the
owner will be liable for any penalty imposed under this chapter.
      8.   A B/TS requires a permit.
      9.   An owner whose building contains a single business is limited to
four (4) B/TS permits per year per frontage (up to a maximum of 2 frontages).
      10.   An owner whose building contains two (2) or more businesses is
limited to six (6) B/TS permits per year per frontage (up to a maximum of 2
frontages).
      11.   For the purpose of determining that the specific limitation on the
number of B/TS that may be displayed on a particular frontage per year is met,
a freestanding B/TS is assigned to the frontage it faces or to the nearest
adjoining frontage, and an attached B/TS is assigned to the frontage that the
wall on which the B/TS is attached faces.
      12.   No more than one B/TS (either freestanding or attached) may be
displayed on a single frontage at any time. If there are two (2) frontages, one
B/TS (either freestanding or attached) may be displayed on each frontage at the
same time.
      13.   Operators may have grand opening or anniversary signs in accordance
with the terms of this chapter. Grand opening or anniversary sign permits do
not count against the number of B/TS that may be displayed per frontage per
year, even if those signs include banners.
      14.   Permits for B/TS will be for a period of twenty (20) days. A twenty
(20) day period may be divided among multiple operators so long as the division
among operators is specified in the permit application. A period of at least
one week must elapse between the end of one permit period and the beginning of
the next permit period.
      15.   B/TS must be in good condition and maintained at all times. Failure
to comply will be a violation of this chapter and may result in the banner
being removed.
      16.   No B/TS permit may be issued while a feather flag permit is in
effect, or during the one week period after the expiration of a feather flag
permit.
   E.   Change Panel Signs: A change panel sign is designed to permit immediate

ultimate responsibility, if an operator violates any part of this chapter, the
owner will be liable for any penalty imposed under this chapter.

based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:

topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
      2.   The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable,
generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      3.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property;
      4.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and has
not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the property;
      5.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located; and
      6.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public street, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
   E.   Conditions And Restrictions: The zoning board of appeals may impose
such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as
may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this section, to
reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other properties in the
neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of this chapter.
   F.   Resubmission Of Application: The same application for a variance may
not be resubmitted within six (6) months of the decision of the zoning board of
appeals unless, in the judgment of the zoning officer, the original application
has been substantially amended. (Ord. 688, 7-21-2011)

there is uniformly distributed a light flux of one lumen.
GLARE: The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is
sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted to cause
annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
IES: Illuminating Engineering Society Of North America, an organization that
establishes standards for the lighting industry.
LIGHT TRESPASS: Any form of artificial illumination emanating from a light
fixture or illuminated sign that penetrates other property as specified in
subsection
9-10-5A of this chapter.
LUMEN: A unit of measure of the quantity of light which falls on an area of one
square foot, every point of which is one foot (1') from the source of one
candela. A light source of one candela emits a total of 12.57 "lumens".
MOTION SENSOR DEVICE: A device that will sense motion electronically and switch
on security lighting for a brief duration.
OBJECTIONABLE DIRECT LIGHT EMISSIONS: Direct light emissions offensively
visible above a height of five feet (5') at the subject property line. A bulb,

be considered a direct light emission source.
OUTDOOR LIGHT FIXTURE: An electrically powered illuminating device containing a
total light source of more than one thousand eight hundred (1,800) initial
lumens per fixture (this is greater than a single 100 watt incandescent lamp,
or two 75-watt reflectorized incandescent bulbs), which is permanently
installed outdoors, including, but not limited to, devices used to illuminate
any site, architectural structure, or sign.
SHIELDED LIGHT FIXTURE: A light fixture with cutoff optics that allows no
direct light emissions above a vertical cutoff angle of ninety degrees (90°)
for street lighting and of eighty degrees (80°) for all other lighting, through
the light fixture's lowest light emitting part. Any structural part of the
light fixture providing this cutoff angle must be permanently affixed. (Ord.
377, 12-19-1996)

BASE TRANSCEIVER STATION: Equipment that provides the link between wireless
communications and land based public telephone switching networks, including
radio frequency transceivers, backup power amplifiers, and signal processing
hardware, typically contained in a small building or cabinet.
COLLOCATION: The location of personal wireless service equipment from more than
one provider on a common tower, building or structure.
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES (PWSF): Facilities for the provision of
personal wireless services, including, but not limited to, structures, other
than a building, such as a monopole or self-supporting or guyed tower, designed
and used to support communication antennas.
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES (PWS): Licensed commercial wireless communication
services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), enhanced
specialized mobilized radio (EMR), paging and similar services.
STEALTH TOWER: A PWSF tower which appropriately models or mimics in size,
shape, and color something in the immediate landscape which could legally be
placed there at the time the application is submitted, such as a silo in farm
settings, a flagpole in an urban area, or a tree in forested areas and which is
unrecognizable to a casual observer as a tower. (Ord. 570, 3-23-2006)
9-12-3: COLLOCATION REQUIRED; EXEMPTIONS:
No request for the construction of a PWSF will be approved unless the finding
is made that the PWSF cannot reasonably be accommodated on an existing
conforming collocation tower, structure, utility pole or other PWSF, inside or
outside the village borders, due to one or more of the following reasons:
   A.   The proposed or planned PWS equipment, if installed, would exceed the
structural capacity of any existing or approved tower, structure, utility pole,
or other PWSF, as documented by a licensed structural engineer, and all
existing and approved towers, structures, utility poles or other PWSF cannot be
reenforced, modified or replaced to accommodate the planned PWS equipment at a
reasonable cost.
   B.   The planned PWS equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment at an existing or approved
tower, structure, utility pole or other PWSF, as documented by a licensed
professional engineer, and interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
   C.   Existing or approved towers, structures, utility poles or other PWSF
cannot accommodate the planned PWS equipment at a height necessary to function
reasonably, as documented by a licensed professional engineer.
   D.   The owner(s) or lessor(s) of existing or approved towers, structures,
utility poles or other PWSF are unwilling to allow collocation upon their
facilities at a reasonable cost.
   E.   Other unforeseen reasons make it unfeasible to locate the proposed or
planned PWS equipment upon an existing or approved tower, structure, utility
pole, or other PWSF, as documented by a licensed professional engineer, as
appropriate. (Ord. 570, 3-23-2006)
9-12-4: GENERAL FACILITY AND ANTENNA REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Any PWSF to be constructed following the effective date hereof, if a
tower, shall only be approved if the PWSF is either 1. a "stealth tower" or 2.
a monopole tower not exceeding seventy-two (72) inches in diameter, with no
external support system (e.g. guy wires).
   B.   The height of any PWSF or antenna to be installed on an existing tower,
pole or structure shall not exceed twenty feet (20') above the highest point of
the existing tower, pole or structure.
   C.   Except for base transceiver stations, the minimum setback for PWSF from
any property line or public roadway shall be equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of the height of the PWSF. The setback for a base transceiver station
shall comply with the requirements of the zoning district in which the
transceiver station is located. The Village Board may alter the setbacks for
PWSFs that are not transceiver stations if a collapse of the tower will not
impact neighboring properties, as documented by a licensed professional
engineer.
   D.   All proposed PWSF and antennas to be mounted on a building or other
structure shall be certified by a licensed structural engineer that the
proposed installation will not exceed the structural capacity of the building
or other structure, considering wind and other loads associated with the
location of the PWSF or antennas.
   E.   Any applicant proposing a PWSF or antenna to be mounted on a building
or other structure shall submit detailed construction and elevation drawings,
for retention by the village, indicating how the PWSF or antenna will be
mounted on the structure.
   F.   Any applicant proposing a PWSF or antenna to be mounted on a building
or other structure shall submit evidence of agreements and/or easements
necessary to provide access to the building or structure on which the tower or
antenna is to be mounted so that the installation and maintenance of the PWSF
or antenna can be accomplished.
   G.   Every PWSF and antenna shall comply with all applicable standards
established by the federal communications commission (FCC) governing human
exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
   H.   PWSF and antennas shall not interfere with public safety

9-13-2: Compliance Required
9-13-3: Permit Requirements
9-13-4: Barrier Requirements
9-13-5: Exemptions From Provisions
9-13-1: PURPOSE:
The provisions of this chapter shall control the requirement, design, and
permitting of barriers for outside residential swimming pools, spas and hot
tubs. The design controls are intended to restrict access to outside
residential swimming pools, spas and hot tubs in certain instances to afford
protection to small children (ages 8 and under) from accidental drowning or
other injury. (Ord. 578, 7-13-2006)
9-13-2: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
   A.   Responsibility For Compliance: Each owner and/or occupant of property
on which a swimming pool, spa or hot tub is located is responsible for
complying with the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Time For Compliance: Except as follows, the provisions of this chapter
apply immediately on the effective date hereof:
      1.   All inground and aboveground (or partly inground and partly
aboveground) swimming pools installed year round, and all spas and hot tubs in
existence on the effective date hereof shall be brought into compliance with
the provisions of this chapter no later than May 1, 2008.
      2.   Moreover, even when an owner and/or occupant believes that an
existing inground or aboveground (or partly inground and partly aboveground)
swimming pool, spa or hot tub complies with all provisions of this chapter, the
owner and/or occupant must nevertheless, by May 1, 2008, apply for a permit as
required by section
9-13-3 of this chapter, providing to the zoning officer all pertinent
information concerning the already built swimming pool, spa or hot tub, and
concerning any required permanent barrier, so that the zoning officer may
certify such compliance. If the zoning officer certifies that the existing
inground or aboveground (or partly inground and partly aboveground) swimming
pool, spa or hot tub complies with all provisions of this chapter, the permit
fee shall be waived. (Ord. 578, 7-13-2006)
9-13-3: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Permit Required: A permit is required for all inground and aboveground
(or partly inground and partly aboveground) swimming pools installed year
round, and for all spas and hot tubs.
   B.   Application For Permit: When applying for a permit, the applicant shall
submit the following to the zoning officer:
      1.   A site plan and building plan indicating all dimensions, including
location, length, width, and depth, of the swimming pool, spa or hot tub.
      2.   For an aboveground (or partly inground and partly aboveground)
swimming pool, information concerning retractable ladders and deck barriers, if
required.
      3.   For a spa or hot tub, information showing compliance of the safety
cover with ASTM designation F1346-91, or showing a safety cover designed by the
manufacturer for the specific spa or hot tub.
      4.   If a permanent barrier is required, a site plan showing the location
of the barrier and information indicating its height and, if the barrier is a
fence, information showing that its design complies with the requirements of
subsection
9-13-4A1 of this chapter.
   C.   Permit Fee: The cost of a permit for a swimming pool and/or fence is
twenty dollars ($20.00). (Ord. 578, 7-13-2006)
9-13-4: BARRIER REQUIREMENTS:
A permanent barrier (either a fence or a wall) to restrict access to a swimming
pool, spa or hot tub is required as set forth in this section. The barrier
shall be constructed to restrict access to the swimming pool, spa or hot tub
itself, or to the yard in which the swimming pool, spa or hot tub is located,
so long as the purpose of affording protection to small children is met.
Placement and construction of the barrier on the property must meet all other
requirements of this title, in addition to the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Inground Swimming Pools:
      1.   A permanent barrier of four feet (4') minimum height shall be
constructed to completely enclose the yard or swimming pool area for all pools
built below ground level. If the barrier is a fence, it shall be constructed so
as not to allow a four inch (4") diameter sphere to pass through the fence. All
gates, door openings or other means of access into the yard or swimming pool
area shall be maintained and secured with such safety features as will provide
an effective barrier to restrict access to the pool by small children.
      2.   No inground swimming pool shall be filled with water until such time
that a permanent barrier is completed. A temporary fence shall be in place
during construction of an inground swimming pool to restrict access to the
construction site until a permanent barrier is in place. If a permanent barrier
becomes damaged and there is open access, a safety fence shall be in place
until the barrier is repaired.
   B.   Aboveground Swimming Pools: Aboveground (or partly inground and partly
aboveground) swimming pools installed year round shall meet the permanent
barrier requirements for inground swimming pools; except, that aboveground (or
partly inground and partly aboveground) swimming pools shall be exempt from the
permanent barrier requirements so long as the top pool edge is four feet (4')
minimum above grade level. Each aboveground (or partly inground and partly
aboveground) swimming pool that is exempt from the barrier requirements shall
nevertheless have retractable ladders installed in such a way as to restrict
access to the pool by small children. The ladders must be retracted whenever
the pool is not in use. If a deck adjoins an aboveground (or partly inground
and partly aboveground) swimming pool, a fence or railing shall be constructed
on the deck to restrict access to the pool by small children.
   C.   Portable Swimming Pools: Swimming pools with a water capacity of twenty
four inches (24") in depth or more (even if regularly filled to a depth of less
than 24 inches), that are not installed year round, and that may be readily
disassembled for storage are characterized as portable swimming pools. Portable
swimming pools are exempt from the permanent barrier requirements for inground
swimming pools, and a permit is not required for such pools. Nevertheless, a
temporary fence of four feet (4') minimum height shall be in place before a
portable swimming pool is filled with water, and shall be kept in place and in
good repair so long as the pool is filled with water. A temporary fence does
not require a permit. A fence installed on a permanent basis, however, does
require a permit.
   D.   Kiddie Swimming Pools: Swimming pools with a water capacity of less
than twenty four inches (24") in depth, that are not installed year round, and
that may be readily disassembled for storage are characterized as kiddie
swimming pools. They are exempt from all provisions of this chapter.
   E.   Spas Or Hot Tubs: Spas or hot tubs with a safety cover that complies
with ASTM designation F1346-91, which is hereby incorporated by reference, or
with a safety cover designed by the manufacturer for the specific spa or hot
tub shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. Otherwise, spas and
hot tubs shall be considered aboveground swimming pools and shall meet the
requirements of subsection B of this section. (Ord. 578, 7-13-2006)
9-13-5: EXEMPTIONS FROM PROVISIONS:
In addition to specific exemptions stated in section
9-13-4 of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter do not apply to inside
swimming pools, spas and hot tubs, nor do they apply to birdbaths, fish ponds,
fountains, dams, and water supply/storage tanks. (Ord. 578, 7-13-2006)

10-1-3: OFFICIAL MAP:
   A.   Purpose: The official map is hereby made a part of this title and is
intended to designate public sites and streets that may be required by the
planning commission or subdivision plats. The designation of such public sites
on final subdivision plats may be required by the planning commission prior to
approval; provided, that such public site is indicated on the official map for
fifteen (15) days prior to the date of application for final approval of the
subdivision plat. Limits to which such areas designated for public use on the
official map may be restricted from development are as specified herein.
   B.   Designation And Acquisition Of Public Sites And Open Spaces: Whenever
the reasonable requirements provided by this title, including the official map,
shall indicate the necessity for providing for a school site, park site,
street, or other public lands within any proposed subdivision for which
approval has been requested, and no such provision has been made therefor, the
governing body may require that lands be designated for such public purpose
before approving such plat. Whenever a final plat of subdivision or part
thereof has been approved by the governing body as complying with the official
map, and there is designated therein a public site, the corporate authorities
having jurisdiction shall acquire such land by condemnation within one year
from date of approval of such plat, and if it does not do so within such period
of one year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners thereof in
any other manner consistent with this title, including the official map and
zoning ordinance so adopted.
   C.   Amendments To Official Map: Amendments to the official map shall be in
accordance with section
10-1-5 of this chapter. Any public or semipublic agency may request the
establishment of a future public site or easement on the official map. When
such proposed site is not included in the comprehensive plan, the requesting
agency shall indicate to the planning commission the need for the site in the
particular location specified. The planning commission shall study the request
and shall report to the governing body as to the consistency of the proposed
site with the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 675, 2-24-2011)
10-1-4: MODIFICATIONS TO PROVISIONS:
   A.   Modifications Permitted:
      1.   Generally: Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary
hardships may result from strict compliance with this title, it may recommend
to the governing body a modification of the regulations so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided, that such
modification will not have the effect of nullifying the purpose of the
comprehensive plan or this title.
      2.   Large Scale Developments: The standards and requirements of this
title may be modified by the planning commission in the case of a plan or a
program for a planned development for a community, or a neighborhood unit,
which, in the judgment of the planning commission, shall exceed the minimum
requirements for adequate public space and improvements for circulation,
recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and
populated and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as
will assure conformity to the purposes of the comprehensive plan.
   B.   Applications Required: Applications for any such modification, except
those initiated by the planning commission, shall be submitted in writing by
the subdivider at the time the preliminary plat is filed for the consideration
of the planning commission. The petitions shall state fully the grounds for the
application and all the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
   C.   Planning Commission Recommendation; Governing Body Approval: In
recommending modifications wherever provided in this title, the planning
commission may prescribe such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so modified. The
recommendation of a modification by the planning commission shall be
conditional and subject to the final approval of the governing body. (Ord. 675,
2-24-2011)
10-1-5: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   This title may be amended, in whole or in part, by the governing body;

proposed changes and a reference to the place or places where copies of the
proposed amendment may be examined, shall be incorporated in the official
notice.
   B.   The hearing shall be informal, but all persons desiring to be heard in
support or opposition shall be afforded such opportunity, and may submit their
statements orally, in writing, or both. The hearing may be recessed to another
date if not concluded, if notice of the time and place thereof is publicly
announced at the hearing or is given by newspaper publication not less than
five (5) days prior to the recessed hearing.

land lying within the jurisdiction of this title shall submit a written

   A.   Preparation Of Plat: The subdivider shall, after the preapplication
procedure of section
10-3-2 of this chapter, cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with
improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified in section
10-6-2 of this title.
   B.   Submission Of Plat: Nine (9) copies of the preliminary plat and
supplementary material shall be submitted to the planning commission with
written application for the approval of the preliminary plat at least ten (10)
days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The application
shall be accompanied by a check or money order, payable to the village, in the

over thirty three (33) lots. Such amount shall be paid into the general
corporate fund of the village to offset the cost of professional review of the
plat.

preliminary plat and supplementary material for conformity with village
ordinances, including the official map. The planning commission may negotiate

preliminary plat is submitted for approval, the governing body, through the
planning commission, shall notify the president of the school board of each
school district in which any of the subdivided land is located that the
preliminary plat has been submitted for approval and that it is available for
inspection. The notice shall also give the date, time, and place of the hearing
on approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat. The notice shall be served
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery. Failure
to notify the school board as required by this subsection C2 does not
invalidate any plat 1 .
      3.   Public Hearing: The planning commission shall conduct a public
hearing on the preliminary plat. Notice of the public hearing shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the village not less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing.
      4.   Planning Commission Approve: The planning commission shall approve
or disapprove the preliminary plat within ninety (90) days from the date of
application or the filing by the applicant of the last item of required
supplementary material, whichever date is later, unless such time is extended
by mutual consent. If the preliminary plat is approved, the planning commission
shall furnish to the applicant a written statement of approval. Because a
preliminary plat approved by the planning commission must still be approved by
the governing body, the planning commission shall forward to the governing body
the preliminary plat and supplementary material submitted by the applicant, and
also a copy of the written statement of approval.
      5.   Planning Commission Disapprove: If the preliminary plat is
disapproved, the planning commission shall furnish to the applicant a written
statement setting forth the reasons for disapproval, specifying with
particularity the aspects in which the proposed preliminary plat fails to
comply with village ordinances, including the official map. Upon disapproval,
the applicant may either appeal the decision to the governing body, or may
submit a revised preliminary plat to the planning commission, attempting to
cure the deficiencies which resulted in disapproval. Submission of a revised
preliminary plat triggers a new ninety (90) day review period as specified in
subsection C4 of this section. If the applicant elects to appeal, written
notice of the appeal shall be directed to the village clerk within thirty (30)
days after the date of the written disapproval of the planning commission, and
the applicant shall attach a copy of the written disapproval to the notice of
appeal. The applicant shall also deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to the
planning commission with a request that the planning commission forward the
governing body the preliminary plat and supplementary material submitted by the
applicant.
   D.   Governing Body Action:

governing body shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plat within thirty
(30) days after its next regular stated meeting following the action of the
planning commission.
      2.   If the preliminary plat is disapproved by the planning commission
and the applicant files a notice of appeal in proper form, the governing body
shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plat within sixty five (65) days
after its next regular stated meeting following the receipt of the notice of
appeal.
      3.   The governing body shall review the preliminary plat and
supplementary material for conformity with village ordinances, including the
official map. (Ord. 675, 2-24-2011)
      4.   If the governing body approves a preliminary plat, it shall direct
the plat officer to sign the preliminary plat and certificate as set forth in
chapter 7 of this title. (Ord. 675, 2-24-2011; amd. Ord. 711, 10-25-2012)
      5.   If the governing body disapproves a preliminary plat, its order or
resolution shall state the reasons for the disapproval, specifying with
particularity the aspects in which the proposed preliminary plat fails to
comply with village ordinances, including the official map.
   E.   Interpretation Of Plat Approval: Approval of the preliminary plat by
the governing body shall not qualify the plat for recording. Approval of the
preliminary plat by the governing body shall be construed to be an expression
of approval of the general layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of
the final plat and to be assurance to the subdivider that the final plat will
be approved if it conforms to the terms of the approved preliminary plat and
all village ordinances. (Ord. 675, 2-24-2011)

ordinances, including conformity with the preliminary plat and compliance with

geographic part or parts of the approved preliminary plat, and may delay
application for approval of other parts until a later date or dates beyond one
year with the approval of the governing body, provided all facilities required
to serve the part or parts for which final approval is sought have been
provided. In such case, only such part or parts of the preliminary plat as have
received final approval shall be recorded.
   C.   Governing Body Action:
      1.   When an applicant for approval of a final plat has supplied all
drawings, maps and other documents required by this title to be furnished in

from the date of filing the last required document or other paper or within

mutually agree to extend the sixty (60) day period.

resolution shall state the reasons for the disapproval, specifying with

village ordinances, including the official map. (Ord. 675, 2-24-2011)

(Ord. 675, 2-24-2011; amd. Ord. 711, 10-25-2012)
10-3-5: BOUNDARY MAP:
   A.   A parcel may be subdivided by use of a boundary map in the following
instances:
      1.   Any parcel of land may be divided into two (2) parts, either of
which part is less than five (5) acres, for the purpose of ownership transfer
or building development. After one such boundary map dividing a tract of land
in one ownership as of June 15, 1978, has been signed by the plat officer, he
shall not sign another boundary map dividing said land. Further division of
said land shall be recorded only by means of a map or plat of subdivision as
provided in this title, which map or plat of subdivision shall include the
parcel previously divided off by a boundary map.
      2.   The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining
and contiguous land that does not create an additional lot.
      3.   The conveyance or dedication of land for highway or other public
purposes or the vacation of land dedicated for a public use.
   B.   A subdivision described herein may be subdivided by recording with the
county recorder an adequate boundary map made thereof by a registered Illinois
land surveyor. Such boundary map shall include all of the following:
      1.   All permanent structures within thirty feet (30') of an existing or
proposed lot line.
      2.   A certification of the county clerk that there are no delinquent or
unpaid general taxes and/or special assessments against the lands described on
this boundary map.
      3.   A signature of the plat officer.
      4.   Shall be drawn with waterproof, nonfading, black ink on tracing
cloth or good quality tracing paper, eighteen inches by twenty four inches (18"
x 24") or larger in six inch (6") multiples.
No such boundary map shall be entitled to be recorded or have validity until it
has been signed by the plat officer. The plat officer shall keep a record and
copy of such boundary maps.
   C.   A parcel subdivided by use of a boundary map shall not be subject to
the platting requirements of this code. However, such subdivision shall be
subject to and comply with all other provisions of this code. The application
for approval of the boundary map shall be accompanied by a check or money
order, payable to the village, in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
Such amount shall be paid into the general corporate fund of the village to
offset the cost of professional review of the plat. Should the village deem it
necessary or desirable to engage legal counsel to review the boundary map, the
applicant shall submit an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00) to offset
the cost of such additional review. (Ord. 735, 7-24-2014)
10-3-6: COMMERCIAL PAD SITES EXEMPT:
The following division of land shall not be considered a subdivision for
purposes of this title, so long as all the following requirements are met:
   A.   The division of land relates to a larger parcel of land that is zoned C
commercial under the village zoning ordinance.
   B.   The larger parcel of land that is zoned C commercial:
      1.   Is a shopping center development, or part of a shopping center
development, that qualifies for a pylon sign under subsection
8-3-10V of this code; or
      2.   Is at least one acre in size, prior to the conveyance of any
commercial pads as provided in this section.
   C.   The division of land is for the purpose of a conveyance by the shopping
center developer or commercial property owner of a pad site to a commercial
user, which pad site either:
      1.   Has the same dimensions as the "footprint" of a proposed commercial
building; or
      2.   Has no more than an additional twenty five percent (25%) of the
square footage of a proposed commercial building, and the additional square
footage is planted and maintained in grass or other landscaping materials and
contains no use other than a commercial trash receptacle or HVAC components.
   D.   The proposed commercial building to be constructed on the pad site will
either:
      1.   Directly adjoin, or be located no more than one foot (1') distant
from, an existing commercial building on the larger parcel of land, which
existing commercial building is owned by the shopping center developer,
commercial property owner, or other commercial pad owner. If the proposed
commercial building will not directly adjoin an existing commercial building,
the gap of no more than one foot (1') must be closed off by the proposed owner
of the pad site in a manner that is aesthetically compatible with the facades
of the two (2) buildings so as to restrict access of any description through
the gap; or
      2.   If the proposed commercial building does not directly adjoin an
existing building and is not located within one foot (1') distance from an
existing commercial building, the buildings may be set apart as long as the two
(2) buildings are at least five feet (5') apart and the facades of the two (2)
buildings are aesthetically compatible.
   E.   The shopping center developer or commercial property owner must certify
to the village that he/she/it will continue to be fully responsible for
ensuring compliance with the following requirements as they pertain to the pad
site, as though the developer or owner continued to own the pad site as part of
the development: public and private access, utility easement access, and site
drainage.
   F.   The shopping center developer or commercial property owner must certify
to the village that he/she/it will continue to be fully responsible for
ensuring compliance with the following requirements of the village zoning
ordinance as they pertain to the pad site, as though the developer or owner
continued to own the pad site as part of the development: public and private
access, off street parking space, and off street loading space.
   G.   The proposed owner of the pad site must certify to the village that he/
she/it will comply with all provisions of the village zoning ordinance that are
not rendered inapplicable by virtue of the proposed construction of a building
so as to occupy all or nearly all of the pad site. (Examples of provisions
rendered inapplicable are maximum building coverage, yard requirements, off
street parking space, and off street loading space.) Building setback
requirements from streets or other rights of way continue to apply to the
siting of the proposed commercial building upon the pad site as though the
shopping center developer or commercial property owner continued to own the pad
site as part of the development.
   H.   If the requirements of this section are met, the village board will
authorize the plat officer to give written approval, in an appropriate form, to
a conveyance of the pad site by metes and bounds description from the shopping
center developer or commercial property owner to the commercial user. (Ord.
746, 4-23-2015)

   A.   As a condition precedent to the approval of any plat or planned
development within the village or within one and one- half (11/2) miles of its
corporate limits, the owner of the property shall, under the following
circumstances, provide for donation of land or a contribution of cash in lieu
thereof to the elementary school district which serves the property:
      1.   Where the plat creates one or more lots intended to be used for
residential purposes; or
      2.   Where the owner seeks approval of a planned development which is
intended to include one or more dwelling units.
   B.   The land donation requirement shall be a function of the number of
dwelling units intended to be created by a subdivision or planned development.
Except as hereafter provided, for each subdivision or planned development
intended to contain one thousand two hundred (1,200) or more dwelling units,
the owner thereof shall provide an elementary school site and a middle school
site. The area of the elementary school site shall be the sum of 0.016 acre for
each single-family dwelling and 0.012 acre for each multi- family dwelling. The
area of the middle school site shall be the sum of 0.018 acre for each single-
family dwelling and 0.014 acre for each multi-family dwelling.
   C.   With respect to subdivisions or planned developments intended to
contain less than one thousand two hundred (1,200) dwelling units and with
respect to all subdivisions or planned developments under circumstances where
the school district having jurisdiction over the property advises the village
that there is no present need for additional school sites, the owner of the
property shall make a contribution of cash in lieu of land. The amount of the
contribution shall be dependent upon the nature of the dwelling unit
contemplated to be constructed and shall be assessed as follows:
      1.   For each single-family dwelling: Three hundred dollars ($300.00).
      2.   For each multi-family dwelling: Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
   D.   The owner of the property proposed to be subdivided shall provide to
the planning commission specific information as to the number of single-family
dwellings and multi-family dwellings intended to be located on the property
upon completion of the development.
   E.   Contributions of cash in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by
the elementary school district whose territory includes the property proposed
to be subdivided for use in the acquisition of land for a new or enlarged
school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that
subdivision or the construction of new school buildings or additions to
existing school buildings, or for the improvement of any existing school site
which already serves such needs. The word improvement, under this subsection,
shall be liberally construed and shall include, but shall not be limited to,
the development of parking lots, sidewalks, traffic signals, minor arterial
streets, collector streets, internal roadways, connections with sewer, water
and electrical lines, playgrounds, recreation grounds and athletic fields. The
term improvement shall further include the construction of buildings, additions
to existing school buildings, remodeled or renovated noninstrumental spaces in
classrooms and the purchase of prefabricated classroom units to be used at a
school site. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of school site is
not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten (10) years from the
date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the owners of record of all lots in
the subdivision or planned development for which such contribution was made.
The refund shall be paid to the person who is the owner of record on the day
which is the tenth anniversary of the receipt of such contribution. The amount
of the refund due shall be equal to the amount of the original contribution
remaining unspent divided by the total number of lots in the subdivision.
   F.   In the event that the property proposed to be subdivided is located
partially in one elementary school district and partially in one or more other
elementary school districts, the donation of land or contribution of cash in
lieu thereof shall be apportioned among the school districts. (Ord. 675, 2-24-
2011)
10-3-10: CONTRIBUTION OF CASH FOR PARK AND RECREATION PURPOSES:
   A.   As a condition precedent to the approval of any plat or planned
development within the village or within one and one- half (11/2) miles of its
corporate limits, the owner of the property shall, under the following
circumstances, provide a contribution of cash for park and recreation purposes:
      1.   Where the plat creates one or more lots intended to be used for
residential purposes; or
      2.   Where the owner seeks approval of a planned development which is
intended to include one or more dwelling units.
   B.   The amount of the contribution shall be dependent upon the nature of
the dwelling unit contemplated to be constructed and shall be assessed as
follows:
      1.   For each single-family dwelling: Three hundred dollars ($300.00).
      2.   For each multi-family dwelling: Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
   C.   The owner of the property proposed to be subdivided shall provide to
the planning commission specific information as to the number of single-family
dwellings and multi-family dwellings intended to be located on the property
upon completion of the development.

standards of the Illinois department of transportation ("IDOT"). Pavement
design for all village streets shall follow the procedure provided in chapter
37 of IDOT's "Bureau Of Local Roads And Streets Manual", 2006. The design
engineer shall specify the relevant criteria and material types to be used in
the construction plans and specifications. IDOT material nomenclature and
quality requirements shall be used for pavement design and construction.
Existing soil properties shall be identified, and a report of the relevant test
results shall be prepared by a qualified geotechnical engineer for use in the
pavement design. Pavement design calculations shall be prepared by a qualified
professional engineer and be submitted to the village along with the final plat
for acceptance before construction. The selection of hot mix asphalt or
portland cement for pavement design shall be approved by the village during
approval of the final plat.
   B.   Subgrade soils shall develop an immediate bearing value ("IBV") in
excess of 6.0. If the in situ soils do not attain this value, remedial
procedures shall be taken to increase the IBV value to 6.0. The in situ IBV,
prior to modification, shall be used for pavement design calculations. The
following minimum values shall be used for pavement materials in the pavement
design:
      1.   Subbase granular material: Six inches (6").
      2.   Aggregate base: Six inches (6").
      3.   Asphalt pavement: Six inches (6").
      4.   Asphalt surface course: 1.25 inches.
      5.   Portland cement concrete: Five inches (5").
   C.   The design engineer shall document that acceptable material types and
thickness are used and achieved during the construction process. The design
engineer shall also perform density testing on all subgrades, aggregate
materials, and asphalt materials. Testing of portland cement concrete shall
include air content, slump, and compression strength. Tests shall be performed
by or under the supervision of the design engineer. A proof roll of the
subgrade shall be completed using a loaded tandem axle dump truck before
pavement materials are placed. The proof roll shall be performed in the
presence of a village representative. Copies of the design engineer's test
results and construction observation records shall be submitted to the village.

10-6-6: RECORDING FINAL PLAT:
Within ninety (90) days after delivery of an approved final plat to the
subdivider by the planning commission, the subdivider shall record the final
plat with the county recorder of deeds. If the plat is not so recorded, it
shall have no validity and shall not be recorded without subsequent approval of
the governing body. The governing body may extend the filing date an additional
ninety (90) days if the subdivider demonstrates unique circumstances or
conditions whereby the recording of the final plat could not be accomplished as
herein required. (Ord. 675, 2-24-2011)
10-6-7: PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Preliminary Approval Of Certain Components Of Public Improvements: Upon
the completion of satisfactory testing, the department of public works may give
preliminary approval to water mains, sanitary sewers and streets after
installation of curbs and base but before installation of pavement. Upon
receipt of such preliminary approval from the public works department, the
planning commission may issue building permits for the construction of
improvements to the lots within the subdivision. In any event, however, no
occupancy permit shall be issued until public improvements which serve the lots
in the subdivision have been accepted by the village as provided in this title.
Notwithstanding the receipt of preliminary approval, the village shall not
provide village services within the subdivision including, without limitation,
maintenance, snowplowing or garbage pick up until final acceptance of all
improvements.
   B.   Inspection Of, Acceptance Of And Warranty For Public Improvements:
      1.   If any plat of a subdivision dedicates public streets, easements or
other improvements to the public use, the approval of the final plat by the
governing body shall not constitute acceptance by the village of any such
public improvements, irrespective of any act or acts by any officer, agent or
employee of the village with respect to such public improvements.
      2.   Upon completion of the public improvements, the subdivider and the
subdivider's engineer shall submit to the village a signed certificate of
compliance which indicates that all public improvements constructed in
connection with the subdivision comply with all applicable requirements of this
title, and that such public improvements were installed substantially in
accordance with the approved construction plans and specifications. The
certification shall be in a form developed and approved by the planning
commission and the public works department and shall, in general, address each
requirement imposed by this title. The public works department shall review the
certificate of compliance and shall conduct such investigation and inspections
as it deems appropriate and recommend to the governing body such action as the
public works department deems appropriate based upon its review and inspection.
(Ord. 675, 2-24-2011)
      3.   Upon completion of the public improvements, the subdivider shall
submit as built plans for all such public improvements which accurately reflect
the location of the public improvements as constructed. Such plans shall be
marked by the engineer as "as built" construction plans. The subdivider or the
subdivider's engineer shall submit to the village a copy of the as built
construction plans on a CD in a format acceptable to the public works
department. If the governing body concludes that the representations made in
the certificate of compliance are accurate, then the governing body shall
accept the dedication of the public improvements on behalf of the village.
However, such acceptance shall not become effective until the subdivider
provides security against structural failure of the public improvements in the
form of a surety bond, cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the cost of constructing the improvements.
Such security shall have the same characteristics as the security for the
completion of the public improvements and shall allow the village to draw upon
the security to pay costs incurred by the village to repair any structural
failure of the public improvements which occurs after the effective date of
acceptance of the public improvements by the village. The security, less any
amount used to repair defective public improvements, shall be released to the
subdivider after the second anniversary of the effective date of acceptance of
the public improvements by the governing body. Security for the completion of
the public improvements provided at the time of final plat approval shall not
be released until such time as the security against structural failure of the
public improvements, as herein provided, has been submitted by the subdivider.
