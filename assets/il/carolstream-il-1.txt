§ 1-1-1 TITLE.
   Upon adoption by the Board of Trustees of an ordinance adopting this code in
its entirety, the code and all amendments thereto as are from time to time
passed, shall be declared to be and shall hereafter constitute the official
“Code of Ordinances of the Village of Carol Stream”. The passage of this code,
or portions thereof, shall not effect the continuing validity of prior
ordinances of the village with which this code is not in conflict, or
ordinances which are passed, but not specifically made a part of this code. Any
reference made to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same under its appropriate chapter
and article heading, and to the general penalty clause relating thereto, as
well as the section itself, when reference is made to this code of ordinances
by title in any legal document.
§ 1-1-2 ACCEPTANCE.
   This code of ordinances, as hereby presented in printed form, shall
hereafter be received without further proof in all courts and in all
administrative tribunals of the state as the ordinances of the Village of Carol
Stream of general and permanent effect.
§ 1-1-3 AMENDMENTS.
   Any additions or amendments to this code, when passed in such form as to
indicate the intention of the Board of Trustees to make the same a part hereof,
shall be deemed to be incorporated in this code so that a reference to the
“Code of Ordinances of the Village of Carol Stream” shall be understood as
including them.
§ 1-1-4 NUMBERING OF SECTIONS.
   Each section number shall consist of three component parts separated by a
dash. The first figure shall refer to the chapter number, the second figure to
the article number and the third figure shall refer to the position of the
section within the article.
§ 1-1-5 DISTRIBUTION OF CODE.
   (A)   All printed copies of this code belonging to the village shall be
deposited with the Village Clerk. The Village Clerk shall deliver one copy
thereof to the Village President, each member of the Board of Trustees, the
Village Manager, the Village Attorney, the Village Prosecutor, and copies to
such other persons as the Village Board may direct.
   (B)   The Village Clerk shall sell printed copies of the code or sections
thereof at such price as the Board of Trustees shall fix.
   (C)   The Village President shall have the power to extend or reciprocate
courtesies of other municipalities by presenting a copy of this code, bound at
the expense of the village, as shall seem suitable, and the Village President
shall also have the power to present two copies of this code to the Illinois
Municipal League.
§ 1-1-6 CONSTRUCTION OF WORDS.
   (A)   Whenever in this code the plural number is used in describing or
referring to any matters, parties or persons, it shall also apply to the
singular number unless the context shall indicate otherwise. When any subject
matter, party or person is referred to in this code by words importing the
singular number only, or the masculine gender, several matters, parties or
persons, and female as well as male, and bodies corporate shall be deemed to be
included. The words PERSON, FIRM or CORPORATION shall be deemed to include any
association or organization of any kind. Words in the present tense shall be
deemed to include the future tense. The words THIS ORDINANCE whenever used in
this code shall be held to mean the entire code, in each and every section
thereof. The word VILLAGE whenever used in this code shall be held to mean the
Village of Carol Stream, Illinois. The words WRITTEN and IN WRITING may include
printing. The word SHALL as used in this code is mandatory. Provided that,
these rules of construction shall not be applied to any section of this code
which contains any express provisions excluding such construction or where the
subject matter or content of such section may be repugnant thereto or where the
context clearly requires a different interpretation.
   (B)   Whenever reference is made in this code to a village officer or
employee by title only, this shall be construed as though followed by the words
“of the Village of Carol Stream” and shall be taken to mean the officer or
employee of this village having the title mentioned or performing the duties
indicated. No provision of this code designating the duties of any officer or
employee shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee liable for
any fine or penalty provided in this code for a failure to perform such duty,
unless the intention of the Village Board to impose such a fine or penalty on
such officer or on an employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the
section creating the duty.
§ 1-1-7 REFERENCE TO SECTION NUMBERS.
   Reference to any section of this code shall be understood to refer to and
include the penalty section relating thereto, unless otherwise expressly
provided.
§ 1-1-8 AMENDMENT OF SECTION SUBJECT TO PENALTY.
   In case of the amendment of any section of this code containing provisions
for which a penalty is provided in another section, the penalty so provided in
such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, whether
re-enacted in the amendatory ordinance or not, unless such penalty is
specifically repealed therein.
§ 1-1-9 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Whenever in this code a minimum but not maximum fine or penalty is
imposed, the court may, in its discretion, fine the offender any sum exceeding
the minimum fine or penalty, but not exceeding $750.
   (B)   Whenever in this code the doing of any action or the omission to do
any act constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this code, and
there shall be no fine or penalty declared for such breach, any person who
shall be convicted of any such breach shall be fined not more than $750 for
each offense. Many sections of this code will not state a specific penalty and
it is the intent of the structure of this code that the penalty set forth
herein shall apply. The Prosecuting Officer may suggest a specific penalty in
an amount less than $750.
   (C)   Whenever the violation of a provision of any ordinance of the village
would entitle the village to recover a fine, it shall not be necessary that
such ordinance specifically say that a penalty is recoverable or specify the
amount of such penalty; in all of such cases, the penalty provision of this
section shall be applicable and included automatically in such ordinance.
   (D)   In addition to, or in lieu of, any fine or penalty which may be
imposed for violation of an ordinance of the village, a disposition of
supervision may be entered by the court upon a plea of guilty or a stipulation
by the defendant of the facts supporting the charge, or a finding of guilty.
Pursuant to such disposition of supervision, the court may defer further
proceedings and the imposition of a sentence, and enter an order for
supervision of the defendant.
   (E)   SUPERVISION means a disposition of conditional and revocable release
without probationary supervision, but under such conditions and reporting
requirements as are imposed by the court, at the successful conclusion of which
disposition the defendant is discharged and a judgment dismissing the charges
is entered.
   (F)   Each day any violation of any provision of this code, or of any
ordinance, shall continue, shall constitute a separate offense.

   Index of minimum fines, see §
15-4-5
§ 1-1-10 OFFENSE HAVING TWO PENALTIES.
   In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by
different clauses or sections of this code, the Prosecuting Officer may elect
under which to proceed, but not more than one recovery shall be had against the
same person for the same offense; provided that the revocation of a license or
permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other
penalty being enforced.
§ 1-1-11 REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES.
   All general ordinances of the village passed prior to the adoption of this
code of ordinances and in conflict with the provisions herein, or which are in
conflict with subsequent amendments to this code shall be repealed by the
passage of the conflicting enactment.
§ 1-1-12 FURTHER EFFECT OF REPEAL.
   (A)   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former
ordinance, whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to
any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any
penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceedings, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the
party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.
   (B)   This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as abating any
action now pending, under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the village
herein repealed; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any
penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm
or corporation, or as waiving any right of the village under any ordinance or
provision thereof in force at the time of the adoption of this code of
ordinances.
§ 1-1-13 REPEAL OF REPEALING ORDINANCE.
   When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision shall
be itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former
ordinance, clause or provision.
§ 1-1-14 INVALIDATION OF PART.
   If any part, section, sentence or clause of this code shall be adjudged void
and of no effect, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portion of this code.
§ 1-1-15 LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS AND AGENTS.
   When the provisions of any section of this code prohibits the commission of
an act, not only the person actually doing the prohibiting act or omitting the
directed act, but also the employer and all other persons concerned with or in
aiding or abetting the person shall be guilty of the offense described and
liable to the penalty set forth.
§ 1-1-16 INTENT.
   All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this
code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of
the Board of Trustees may be fully carried out.
§ 1-1-17 WAIVER TO THE CODE OF ORDINANCES.
   The Village Board may grant waivers and/or variances from provisions within
this code of ordinances by motion; except where state statute or this code
require a different or more formal procedure, in which case any waivers and/or
variances granted shall be temporary in nature, and each such motion shall be
limited to the granting of waivers and/or variances for a period not in excess
of 120 days.

      (E)   When it has been decided that the “previous question” shall be
taken.
   Rule 14. Motion to adjourn.
      A motion to adjourn cannot be amended; but a motion to adjourn to a given

      When a question is postponed indefinitely, it shall not be taken up again

an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained.
   Rule 17. Amendments.
      Only one amendment at a time may be offered to any question before the
Board. The vote shall first be taken on the amendment and, if the amendment
passes, then further amendments may be proposed. Finally, a vote shall be taken
on the principal motion as finally amended.
   Rule 18. Reconsideration.
      (A)   A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same
meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A motion for
reconsideration, once having been made and decided in the negative, shall not
be renewed. A matter once having been decided and a motion to reconsider such
matter having been defeated, it may nonetheless come before the Board at a
future time by way of a motion to rescind or as a new motion. If the Chair
determines that new facts are to be presented to the Board, or that there is a
likelihood that the Board will reverse its previous decision, the Chair shall
rule the motion in order. If a motion is continuously brought before the Board
and rejected, the Chair may rule its reintroduction under a motion to rescind
or as a new motion to be out of order.
      (B)   No motion to reconsider the approval or denial of the
recommendation of an advisory body required to hold public hearings shall be

hearing and recommendation.
      (C)   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by members who
voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that, where a motion has received
a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the
passage or adoption of such motion, then in such case a motion to reconsider
may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such
question to be reconsidered, so long as the issue presented is the same, no new
information is forthcoming and the rights of third parties have not intervened.
   Rule 19. Visitors petitioners and public comment.
      (A)   Village Board meetings constitute legislative sessions of the Mayor

attacks directed at the members of the Board, staff, speakers or other members

      (F)   All public comment shall be addressed to the Mayor and Board of
Trustees as a whole and no comments shall be addressed to individual members of
the Board, village staff or other members of the public.
      (G)   No final action may be taken on any public comment or concern which
requires an ordinance, resolution, or written contract, or which has the effect
of approving any expenditure of funds unless such item is on the agenda for
that meetings. The Board may, however, direct that any matter raised on these
orders be set for a future agenda, including the preparation of ordinances,
resolutions, or other documents for consideration at such time.
      (H)   Any person who shall disrupt by disorderly conduct a meeting of the
Mayor and Board of Trustees, its committees or any meeting of a board,
commission or advisory body of the village shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined not less than $50 nor more than $750.

appropriation shall be published as required by statute, either in a newspaper
or in pamphlet form, in which case, the ordinance in its pamphlet form shall be
displayed for a reasonable period in a public place in the Village Hall.
   Rule 24. Time for taking effect.
      No ordinance which must be published to comply with the foregoing section
shall go into effect until ten days after it is so published unless a statement
of the urgency of the ordinance is contained in it, and it achieves passage by
a two-thirds vote of the Board of Trustees then holding office. In all other
cases, the ordinances shall go into effect upon the passage thereof, as
provided by statute, even though the operation of the ordinance may not take
effect until a later date.
   Rule 25. Adoption of Robert’s Rules of Order, Revised.
      The rules of parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published
edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, Revised shall govern the Board in all cases
to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the
ordinances of the village including these rules, or the statutes of the state.

§ 1-9-4 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   The village will investigate any allegations of discriminatory village work
environment harassment, sexual harassment or retaliation. All allegations,
including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of
how the matter comes to the attention of the village. However, because of the
difficulties associated with the investigation of workplace harassment, the
claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective
investigation. The following procedure has been instituted for making
complaints about conduct in violation of this policy.
   (A)   Any person covered by this policy observing an act of harassment or
who is the object of harassment shall report the suspected harassment by a
village employee, village official, contractor, business invitee, customer or

investigation.

believes to be an act of harassment must not assume that the village is aware
of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and a victim of harassment fails to
notify the village as provided herein, the village will not be presumed to have
knowledge of the harassment.
   (C)   The immediate supervisor department head informed of the complaint
will notify the Human Resources Department within 24 hours. An investigation of
the suspected harassment will be initiated at the direction of the Human
Resources Department, generally within five working days of notification. If
deemed necessary, additional individuals may assist in the investigation. The
investigation will include an interview with the person(s) who made the initial
report and the person(s) toward whom the suspected harassment was directed. Any
other person who may have information regarding the alleged harassment may also
be interviewed.

preparing a written report within ten working days of his or her completion of
the investigation, unless extenuating circumstances prevent him or her from
doing so. The report shall include a finding that the harassment has been
substantiated or the harassment cannot be substantiated.
   (E)   Every effort shall be made to keep all matters related to the
investigation and various reports as confidential as possible.

reported any act which he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be
unlawful harassment, or because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or
hearing with respect to any alleged harassment. Any form of retaliation, if
established, is subject to administrative and/or disciplinary action.
   (B)   Any person covered by this policy who believes he or she has
experienced or witnessed retaliation should report such conduct immediately to
his or her immediate supervisor, department head, except where such person is
the one accused of retaliation. In such case, the complaint should be reported

discharge and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to

ordinances as the Board may deem necessary to transfer and expend moneys
appropriated for other purposes, or borrow moneys from the United States

disaster or disaster training exercise, suffer disease, injury or death shall,
for the purposes of benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act or Workers’
Occupational Diseases Act only, be deemed to be employees of the state, if: the
claimant is duly qualified and enrolled (sworn in) as a volunteer of the
Illinois Emergency Management Agency or an Emergency Management Agency
accredited by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; and, if the claimant
was participating in an actual “disaster”, as defined in §
3-5-3 or the exercise participated in was specifically and expressly approved
by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. The Illinois Emergency Management
Agency shall use the same criteria for approving an exercise and utilizing
state volunteers as required for any political subdivision. The computation of

commensurate with comparable state employees doing the same work or income from
the person’s regular employment, whichever is greater.

application of this section receives in connection with the disease, injury or
death giving rise to such entitlement, benefits under an act of Congress or

article or any rules or regulations promulgated pursuant to this article, are
liable for the death of or any injury to persons, or damage to property, as a
result of such activity. This section does not, however, affect the right of
any person to receive benefits to which he would otherwise be entitled under
this article under the Workers’ Compensation Act or the Workers’ Occupational
Disease Act, or under any pension law, and this section does not affect the
right of any such person to receive any benefits or compensation under any act

receiving telecommunications when sold for use. The tax authorized by this
article shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the retailer who provides

same manner as the original charge for such taxable services. If the retailer
fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required
to pay the tax direct to the village.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross

   Village Manager, see
Ch. 2, Art. 1
§ 5-8-1 PURCHASING AGENT.
   The Village Manager, or such person designated by him or her, shall have
among his or her duties the purchasing of all supplies, materials, fuel,
equipment and services for use by all departments, commissions and agencies of
the village, except where provisions to the contrary are made by the corporate
authorities. Such purchases shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
this article.
§ 5-8-2 CONTRACTUAL LIABILITIES; LIMITATIONS.
   No contract shall be made by the corporate authorities, or by any committee
or member thereof, and no expense shall be incurred by any of the officers,
employees or departments of the village, whether the object of the expenditure
has been ordered by the corporate authorities or not, unless the expenditure is
consistent with the budget ordinance as amended concerning that contract or
expense. Any contract made, or any expense otherwise incurred, in violation of
the provisions of this section shall be null and void as to the village, and no
money belonging thereto shall be paid on account thereof. However, pending the
passage of the annual budget for any fiscal year, the corporate authorities may
authorize the Village Manager to make necessary expenditures for the support
thereof upon the basis of the budget ordinance of the preceding fiscal year.
However, if it is determined by two-thirds vote of the corporate authorities
then holding office, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the corporate
authorities, that it is expedient and in the best public interest to begin
proceedings for the construction of a needed public work, then the provisions
of this section shall not apply to the extent that the corporate authorities
may employ or contract for professional services necessary for the planning and
financing of such public work.
§ 5-8-3 PURCHASING, CONTRACTS, SOLICITING BIDS AND CHANGE ORDERS.
   The procedures of the village regarding purchasing of goods and services,
letting of contracts, soliciting bids for those goods and services and change
orders shall be as follows:
   (A)   (1)   The Purchasing Agent shall develop administrative procedures for
purchases of up to and including $25,000 by contract or otherwise for public
works construction projects, and any Motor Fuel Tax funded expenditures, and
$25,000 for supplies, materials, fuel, equipment and services and other items
utilized by all departments, commissions and boards of the village. The
Purchasing Agent shall have the authority to make purchases of personal
property, acquire interests in real property, and contract for services of up
to and including $25,000, to the extent authorized in accordance with §
5-8-2 herein.
      (2)   All vendors or contractors who sell goods or perform services to
the village shall conform with the requirements of this article as shall govern
the furnishing of goods and services to the village. The Purchasing Agent will
promptly report to the Board all financial transactions other than matters
handled through the petty cash fund. The Board shall consider and, where
appropriate, approve the transactions entered into under the procedures
developed by the Purchasing Agent. Contracts entered into by the Purchasing
Agent where all funds have not been paid can be canceled by the Board of
Trustees.
   (B)   Except as provided in §
5-8-14, contracts for public works construction projects or Motor Fuel Tax
funded expenditures for more than $25,000 and purchases of goods or services
for more than $25,000, except those for professional services, shall be made on
the basis of awarding of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder after
advertising for bids has taken place. By a two-thirds vote of the trustees
elected, this requirement of bidding may be waived.
   (C)   (1)   Notice inviting bids shall be published at least once in a
newspaper generally circulated within the village at least five days prior to
the date set for receiving such proposals; provided, however, that, where the
goods to be purchased are of a specialized nature, the notice may be published
in a publication pertaining to those particular goods. Such notice shall
include a general description of the articles to be purchased or the services
to be performed, shall state where bid blanks and specifications may be
secured, including the cost, if any, of the specifications, the amount of bid
deposit required, and the time and location for opening bids.
      (2)   In calling for bids of public works projects, the notice shall
provide that the general prevailing rate of wages shall be paid for each craft
or type of worker needed to perform such work, as provided by statute.
      (3)   The notice shall be placed in a prominent place in the village
building.
   (D)   The Purchasing Agent may approve increases in public works
construction contract amounts due to change orders not to exceed in total 5% of
the awarded contract amount and change orders extending the time of completion
of public works construction contracts for not more than 30 days without prior
Village Board approval. However, no single change order shall exceed $10,000,
except where a delay in approving such change order would result in a financial
penalty or would create a serious emergency within the village which would
endanger the health or safety of its citizens. In such event, the provisions of
§
5-8-17 shall be used. The Purchasing Agent shall report his or her actions in
making such approvals at the next regular scheduled Village Board meeting.

§ 5-8-4 BIDDERS’ LIST AND PRE-QUALIFICATION.
   (A)   The Purchasing Agent shall also solicit sealed bids from all
responsible prospective suppliers who have requested their names to be added to
a “Bidders’ List”, which the Agent shall maintain, by sending them a copy of
such newspaper notice or such other notice as will acquaint them with the
proposed purchase or sale.
   (B)   In any case, invitations sent to the vendors on the bidders’ list
shall be limited to commodities or services typically provided by them.
   (C)   The Purchasing Agent may establish pre-qualification standards and
procedures and may require prospective bidders to pre-qualify themselves for
bidding on village contracts. The purpose of such pre-qualification shall be to
save the time of bidders who would be found unqualified before they prepare
individual bids. Another purpose for such pre-qualification shall be to save
the time of the village in reviewing the bids of unqualified entities and to
allow for a more expeditious bidding procedure. The standards for such pre-
qualification shall be the same as those used to award a bid, except for the
absence of any bid price. If a bidder participates in a pre-qualification
process and is found to be unqualified, the bidder shall be notified in writing
of this determination and shall be given an opportunity to respond in writing
and may be accorded a hearing. The Purchasing Agent may determine that for any
purchase or class of purchases, only bidders which have been pre-qualified
shall be permitted to submit bids.
§ 5-8-5 BID OPENING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Bids shall be submitted sealed to the Purchasing Agent and shall be
identified as bids for the specific proposal or project submitted.
   (B)   Bids shall be opened in public at the time and location stated in the
notice inviting bids.
   (C)   A tabulation of all bids received shall be made by the Purchasing
Agent and forwarded to the corporate authorities.
§ 5-8-6 AWARD OF BID.
   (A)   The corporate authorities shall award the bid to the lowest
responsible bidder.

      (1)   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract or provide the service required;
      (2)   Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service
promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference;
      (3)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder;
      (4)   The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;
      (5)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and
ordinances relating to the contract or service;
      (6)   The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;
      (7)   The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies, or
contractual services to the particular use required;
      (8)   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service
for the use of the subject of the contract; and
      (9)   The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
§ 5-8-7 REJECTION OF BIDS.
   The corporate authorities shall have the authority to reject all bids, parts
of bids or all bids for any one or more supplies or contractual services
included in the proposed contract, when the public interest will be served
thereby.
§ 5-8-8 BID DEPOSITS.
   Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to the return of bid deposits
immediately after action is taken on the bids by the corporate authorities or
sooner if authorized by the Purchasing Agent. The corporate authorities may
hold the bid deposit of a bidder chosen as the alternate successful bidder
until the successful bidder has signed the contract, but no longer than 30 days
after the award of the bid. A successful bidder shall forfeit any bid deposit
upon failure on his or her part to enter into a contract with the village
within ten days after the award of the bid.
§ 5-8-9 TIE BIDS.
   If any bids are received for the same total amount or unit price, quality,
service and all other pertinent facts being equal, the contract may be awarded
by drawing lots in public.
§ 5-8-10 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AGREEMENT.
   All contracts by independent contractors shall either contain therein
approximately the following terms and conditions or shall, as a result of their
enactment, have such terms and conditions made a part thereof as if they were
contained therein:
   “The independent contractor hereby agrees:

federal, state, county, municipal and/or other governmental unit or regulatory
body now in effect, or which may be in effect during the performance of the
work to which reference is made above. Included within the scope of the laws,
regulations and rules referred to in this paragraph, but in nowise to operate
as a limitation, are all forms of traffic regulations, public utility and

Compensation Laws, the Social Security Act of the Federal Government and any of

officers of independent contractors or subcontractors of the first and second
parties, on account of personal injuries or death, or damages to property
occurring, growing out of, incident to, or resulting directly or indirectly
from the performance by the independent contractor hereunder, whether such
loss, damage, injury or liability is contributed to by the negligence of the
village or by premises themselves or any equipment thereon whether latent or
patent, or from other causes whatsoever, except that the independent contractor
shall have no liability or damages or the costs incident thereto caused by the
sole negligence of the village.
   (C)   To keep in force, to the satisfaction of the village, at all times
during the performance of the work referred to above, public liability
insurance and automobile liability insurance with bodily injury limits of not
less than $500,000, and property damage insurance with limits of not less than
$300,000. The independent contractor shall furnish proof of such insurance
coverage and may be required to cause the village to be named as an additional
insured prior to execution of any contract. The village may, in specific bid
documents, require higher levels of insurance coverage. The independent
contractor may seek to have the village waive this requirement of conventional
insurance if it has established a self-insurance program supported by
reasonable reserves.
   (D)   To furnish any affidavit or certificate, in connection with the work
covered by this agreement as provided by law.
   (E)   To indemnify the village for any loss it may sustain by theft or other

having contracts with the principal or with sub-contractors, all just claims
due them under the provisions of such contracts for labor performed or

bond is given, when such claims are not satisfied out of the contract price of
the contract on account of which this bond is given, after final settlement

agent or broker of the contractor’s choice, subject to the right of reasonable
approval or disapproval by the corporate authorities.

§ 5-10-1 TAX IMPOSED.
   A tax is imposed on the privilege of transferring title to real estate
within the corporate limits of the village, on the privilege of transferring a
beneficial interest in real property which is the subject of a trust, and on
the privilege of transferring a controlling interest in a real estate entity
owning property located in the village, at the rate of $3 for each $1,000 of
value or fraction thereof stated in the declaration provided for in this
article. REAL ESTATE shall mean both land and any structures permanently
affixed to the land. The tax herein levied shall be in addition to any and all
other taxes. The tax is due if the transfer is made by one or more related
transactions or involves one or more persons or entities and whether or not a
document is recorded. The fee to obtain an exempt stamp is $25.

§ 5-10-2 LIABILITY FOR TAX.
   The ultimate incidence, and liability for payment, of the tax imposed by
this article shall be borne by the grantor of any deed and the grantor,
assignor or transferor of any instrument conveying the beneficial interest in
real property which is the subject of a land trust, or the controlling interest
in a real estate entity subject to this article or, in the case of a Sheriff’s
sale, or a sale by tax deed the tax imposed by the article shall be borne by
the buyer. Where the buyer receives the property by Sheriff’s sale or a tax
deed, the village shall make a reasonable determination of the liability for
the tax based upon the rate of $3 for each $1,000 of value or fraction thereof
received by the buyer in the transaction. The value states by the buyer shall
be considered.

§ 5-10-3 LIEN: ENFORCEMENT.
   In the event a deed or trust document is filed for recordation without the
revenue stamps provided for by this article, a lien is declared against the
real property conveyed or transferred in the amount of the tax. The fact that
the deed or trust document does not contain a village revenue stamp in an
amount equal to the transfer tax imposed pursuant to this article shall
constitute constructive notice of the lien. The village may record a lien for
the non-payment of the tax. The lien may be enforced by proceedings to
foreclose pursuant to the Illinois Compiled Statutes. Nothing contained in this
article shall be interpreted as preventing the village from collecting the tax
imposed herein pursuant to a civil cause of action, including interest and
penalties as provided for in this article.
(Ord. 92-04-41, passed 4-14-1992)
§ 5-10-4 PURCHASE OF STAMPS.
   The tax levied by this article shall be paid by the purchase of tax stamps,
or other designation determined by the village through the Director of Finance
or his or her agent. The payment of the tax shall be denoted by an adhesive
stamp or stamps affixed to the face of the deed or trust document, or as
otherwise determined and designated by the village.
(Ord. 92-04-41, passed 4-14-1992)
§ 5-10-5 FILING OF DECLARATION.
   (A)   At such time as the tax levied by this article is paid, there shall be
filed with the Director of Finance a declaration, on a form prescribed by the
Director of Finance. The declaration shall be signed by at least one of the
sellers and also by at least one of the buyers in the transaction or by the
attorneys or agents for the sellers and buyers. The declaration shall state

parent corporation for no consideration other than the cancellation or
surrender of the subsidiary’s stock;
      (10)   Deeds wherein there is an actual trade or exchange or real estate
and trust documents wherein there is an actual trade or exchange of beneficial
interests; except that, the money difference or money’s worth paid from one to
the other shall not be exempt from the tax;
      (11)   Deeds representing transfers subject to the imposition of a

or expresses an intent to lease to a majority of the land, or in the case of a
building, the structure, to a non-governmental body.
   (B)   Every deed or trust document which is tax exempt pursuant to this
section shall be presented to the Director of Finance so as to be appropriately
marked by the Director to be eligible for recordation without the payment of
tax. At such time as a deed or trust document is presented to the Director,
pursuant to this section, there shall be filed with the Director a certificate
setting forth the facts which justify the exemption of the deed or trust
document presented. The certificate shall be executed on behalf of either the
grantor or grantee and shall be on a form provided by the Director.

§ 5-10-7 REAL ESTATE TRANSFER TAX STAMPS.
   (A)   The tax herein levied and imposed shall be collected by the Director
of Finance through the sale of real estate transfer tax stamps, which shall be
caused to be prepared by the Director in such quantities as the Director may
from time to time prescribe. Such stamps shall be available for the sale at,
and during the regular business hours of, the village offices and the offices
of such agents as the village may designate. For the purpose of reviewing the
request for the stamps, the village shall process a request within two working
days. Upon payment of the tax herein levied and imposed, the stamps so
purchased shall be affixed to the deed or trust document or other instrument of
conveyance as required by this article. Any person so using and affixing a
stamp shall cancel it and so deface it as to render it unfit for re-use by
marking it with his initials and the day, month and year when the affixing
occurs. Such markings shall be made by writing or stamping in indelible ink or
by perforating with a machine or punch; however, the stamp(s) shall not be so
defaced as to prevent ready determination of its denomination and genuineness.
The Carol Stream Real Estate Transfer Tax Stamp shall be of a design determined
by the Village Manager.
   (B)   The village hereby determines to establish an administrative fee upon
the issuance of exempt stamps under its real estate transfer tax ordinance. The
village has determined that there are substantial administrative costs in
determining whether an individual seeking an exempt stamp under the village’s
real estate transfer tax ordinance is entitled to such a stamp. Because the
amount of the tax due under the village’s real estate transfer tax ordinance
may be quite substantial, individuals understandably may make an application
for an exempt stamp when there is a serious question as to whether the
applicant is entitled to the tax exemption. The village has not previously made
a charge for evaluating and processing such applications for tax exemptions,
and the cost of such services has been substantial, and no fee has been charged
previously for such service. The fee payable with an application for a real
estate tax exemption stamp shall be $25.

trust document transferring any beneficial interest in real property which is
the subject of a land trust within the corporate limits of the village shall be
entitled to recordation by the Recorder of Deeds, DuPage County, Illinois,
unless such deed shall bear either a village real estate transfer tax stamp in
the amount required by this article, or an exemption mark from the Village
Director of Finance.

§ 6-8-1 DEFINITIONS.
   The words contained in this article shall have the common meaning ascribed
to them or such meanings as are contained within other sections of the code of
ordinances of the village; provided, however, that, the following words shall
be interpreted to mean as follows.
   ADJACENT LOTS. Lots which adjoin or share side property lines or lots in
which, although separated by a street, front property lines overlap another by
more than 30%.
   STREETSCAPE. The facades of single-family dwellings on both sides of a
street. The length of a STREETSCAPE shall be limited to no more than 20 lots
per side of street. When more than 20 lots per street side exist without an
intervening cross street, the village shall, through one of its officers or
employees, establish those lots which shall constitute a separate STREETSCAPE.
In making that determination, the official shall consider that configuration of
lots which shall be most influenced and affected by adjacent lots. Where
possible, physical demarcations such as topography, road configuration or
landscaping shall be utilized in establishing the appropriate STREETSCAPES. In
general, the front orientation of the residence will determine the applicable
STREETSCAPE.
§ 6-8-2 ANTI-MONOTONY CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS FOR ONE-FAMILY DWELLING UNITS.
   (A)   Generally. No two single-family dwellings of similar front elevation
or facade shall be constructed or located on adjacent lots; nor shall there be
constructed or located single-family dwellings of similar front elevation or
facade constituting more than 20% of the single-family dwellings in any
streetscape. Front elevations or facades shall be deemed to be similar when
there is no substantial difference in roof lines; and no substantial change in
windows of either size, location or type; and either no change in the color of
materials used (rather than a change in shade), or no substantial change in the
kind of materials.
   (B)   Roof lines.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following differences in the
roof lines of single-family dwellings as seen from the front of the dwelling
shall be deemed sufficient to render buildings containing such changes and
built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
         (a)   Changing gable roofs to hip roofs;
         (b)   Changing hip roofs to gable roofs;
         (c)   Providing an intersecting gable roof on the main gable roof,
provided that the height of the intersection roof is at least 50% of the height
of the main roof;
         (d)   Providing an intersecting hip roof on the main hip roof;
provided that, the height of the intersecting hip roof is at least 50% of the
height of the main roof;
         (e)   Subject to review by the Building Official, a shed roof, when
used as a front porch roof for a minimum of 50% of the entire width of the
house, excluding area of garage;
         (f)   Subject to review by the Building Official, a substantial
difference in roof line shall be deemed to exist if the front soffit is
increased significantly and is combined with columns at least six inches in
width or other architectural features of a similar magnitude which reach the
roof line of the highest story;
         (g)   Rotating gable roofs 90 degrees on the building; and
         (h)   On a tri-level residence or other building type which has three
independent major roof areas, the changing of two out of three roof lines shall
be acceptable as a substantial change. Acknowledging certain design elements
may prevent the changing of all three roof lines, it is desired that the roofs
with the greatest impact on the streetscape be changed.
      (2)   The following changes shall not be deemed sufficient to make
adjacent structures dissimilar:
         (a)   Gable roof atop hip roof;
         (b)   Hip roof atop gable roof;
         (c)   Small gable or hip projections above windows;
         (d)   Window dormers;
         (e)   Change in soffit overhang or minor variation in eave height; and
         (f)   Skylight and cupola.
   (C)   Windows.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following differences in the
size, location or type of windows shall be deemed sufficient to render
buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
         (a)   Changing from single windows to a multiple window arrangement
(ganged units);
         (b)   Changing from multiple window arrangement to single window;
         (c)   Changing the type of windows (e.g., casement to double hung);
and
         (d)   Providing a bay or bow window in the area of the predominant
window.
      (2)   The following change shall not be deemed sufficient to constitute a
substantial change in windows: the addition or subtraction of muntin bars
(dividing lights).
      (3)   Where, because of its size, location or design, one window is the
predominant window on the front elevation or facade, if the size, location or
type of that window is changed to render the dwelling dissimilar, then no other
window need be changed.
   (D)   Construction material or color.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following differences in
construction material between adjacent single-family dwellings as seen from the
front of the dwellings shall be deemed sufficient to render buildings
containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar.
         (a)   Four-inch exposure horizontal siding;
         (b)   Eight-inch exposure horizontal siding;
         (c)   Brick facing;
         (d)   Vertical siding;
         (e)   Stone facing; and
         (f)   Stucco/staccato board and trim.
      (2)   When materials are changed, the change must occur throughout the
front facade or elevation for a minimum of one story in height.
      (3)   Color change shall be made by significant changes in adjacent
colors. The change must be one of color rather than merely of the shade.
§ 6-8-3 ADMINISTRATION.
   The provisions of this article shall initially be administered by the
Building Official of the village. The Building Official shall find single-

§ 6-9-8 VARIANCES.
   The Village Board may grant variances from the regulatory standards of this

      (7)   The variance shall be in conformance with all requirements of
Article XVI Variances of the DuPage County Countywide Stormwater and Flood
Plain Ordinance as adopted in
Ch. 6, Art. 14 of this code.
   (B)   Variances to lower protection levels. In addition to the requirements
of division (A) above, a variance from the requirements of this article that
would result in a structure not being protected to the elevation of the base
flood shall also meet the following requirements:
      (1)   The Village Board, by a notation on the application, notifies the
applicant in writing that such construction below the base flood level will
increase the risks to life and property and that the applicant proceeds with
full knowledge of these risks;
      (2)   The Village Board notifies the applicant that if the variance is
issued, it is contingent upon the applicant obtaining approval from other
agencies having jurisdiction, when the variance violates the requirements of
such agencies;
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with full knowledge of these
risks and that he or she will acknowledge in writing that he or she assumes all
risks and complete liability.
   (C)   “Wet floodproofed” building. A variance from the requirements of this

      (3)   Any future alteration of the area below the FPE that violates the
conditions of the variance shall be deemed a violation of this article. The
applicant shall be informed by a notation on the application or otherwise that
any such alteration is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore will cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.

reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the
National Register of Historical Places or documented as worthy of preservation
by the state Department of Conservation may be granted using criteria more

limitation or repeal of any other powers by state statutes.
(Ord 2012-07-27, passed 7-16-2012)
§ 6-9-10 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
article does not imply that development either inside or outside of the SFHA
will be free from flooding or damage. This article nor any other provisions of
this code relating to flood prone areas does not create liability on the part
of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this code or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

§ 6-9-11 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit or certification for development in the SFHA or
failure to comply with the requirements of this article or conditions of a
variance granted under this article shall be deemed to be a violation of this
article. The Building Official or Village Engineer may determine upon due
investigation that a violation of the minimum standards of this article exist,
and after such owner fails, after ten days notice, to correct his or her
property, the village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this article or make such other order as
the court sees necessary to secure compliance with the article. Any person who
violates this article shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not less than
$75 nor more than $750. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. Failure to comply with
the requirements of a permit, certification or conditions of a variance
resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this article. The Building
Official or Village Engineer shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. Nothing herein
shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or
remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person
or persons responsible.

cash, or adequate security, in the amount of $500 per lot, which shall be known
as the grading guarantee deposit. This deposit shall be in addition to any
project performance bond or letter of credit previously established with regard

existing in the grading and drainage of the lot.
      (2)   In the event that the grading defect is determined, but not
corrected after reasonable notice, the village may utilize the funds to correct
the defect. However, the utilization of this grading guarantee deposit shall

§ 6-13-10 OCCUPANCY VARIANCE, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE DEPOSITS, AND TEMPORARY
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Occupancy variance deposit. A variance from the requirements for
occupancy may be granted by the building official, or his or her designee, in
light of an inability of the builder to complete such requirements due to
inclement weather or upon other good cause shown as being beyond the control of
the builder. Such requirements for occupancy shall include completion of all
work items associated with the approved building permit or permits for the
occupied space within the premises. A variance shall not be granted from health
or life safety code requirements.
      (1)   When a variance is so issued, there shall be submitted to the
village a cash deposit in the amount of 125% of the estimated probable cost of
construction of the incomplete work, including the cost of completion of as-
built plans if so required by the Village Engineer. The estimated probable cost
of construction shall be approved by the building official or his or her
designee.
      (2)   The purpose of the occupancy variance deposit shall be to ensure
that the items not completed at time of occupancy will be completed within 60
days after the weather, soil conditions or other impediment to completion
allows for the incomplete work to be finished. Upon granting of an occupancy
variance, occupancy of the premises shall be permitted. The amount of the
deposit shall be held by the village, and the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy shall be withheld until such time as the work has been completed.
      (3)   If the specific defects pertaining to the occupancy variance
deposit are not corrected within the 60-day period set forth above, the village
shall notify the party which submitted the occupancy variance deposit of the
specific defect still preventing the issuance of a final certificate of
occupancy and the release of the deposit. The village may, after reasonable
notice, utilize the funds to correct the defect. The utilization of this
occupancy variance deposit shall not prevent the village from taking other
action against the person responsible for the defect preventing the issuance of
the certificate of occupancy, including but not limited to the filing of a
lawsuit for injunction, ordinance violation or the withdrawal of the occupancy
permit.
      (4)   Without regard to any provision contained within this Code, the
occupancy variance deposit shall not be released by the village until the
entire area immediately affected by the incomplete work items shall have also
been found to comply with the ordinances of the village.
   (B)   Performance guarantee deposit. A temporary postponement of the
requirements for completion of landscaping or landscape appurtenances may be
granted by the building official, or his or her designee, in light of an
inability of the builder to complete such work due to inclement weather or upon
other good cause shown as being beyond the control of the builder. Such
requirements shall include completion of all landscaping or landscape
appurtenance work items associated with the approved building permit or permits
for a premises or common area adjacent thereto, if applicable. Approval of such
postponement shall not be granted unless the premises has otherwise been deemed
ready for occupancy and all health and life safety code requirements have been
completed.
      (1)   When a temporary postponement of the requirements for completion of
landscaping or landscape appurtenances is approved by the building official,
there shall be submitted to the village a cash deposit in the amount of 125% of
the estimated probable cost of construction of the incomplete work. The
estimated probable cost of construction shall be approved by the building
official or his or her designee. Such cash deposit shall be known as the
performance guarantee deposit.
      (2)   The purpose of the performance guarantee deposit shall be to ensure
that the items not completed at time of occupancy will be completed within 60
days after the weather, soil conditions or other impediment to completion
allows for the incomplete work to be finished. Upon granting of a temporary
postponement of the requirements for completion of landscaping or landscape
appurtenances, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued and occupancy of the
premises shall be permitted. The amount of the deposit shall be held by the
village until such time as the work has been completed.
      (3)   If the specific defects pertaining to the performance guarantee
deposit are not corrected within the 60-day period set forth above, the village
shall notify the party which submitted the performance guarantee deposit of the
specific defect still preventing the release of the deposit. The village may,
after reasonable notice, utilize the funds to correct the defect. The
utilization of this performance guarantee deposit shall not prevent the village
from taking other action against the person responsible for the defect
preventing the release of the deposit, including but not limited to the filing
of a lawsuit for injunction or ordinance violation.
      (4)   Without regard to any provision contained within this Code, the
performance guarantee deposit shall not be released by the village until the
entire area immediately affected by the incomplete work items shall have also
been found to comply with the ordinances of the village.
   (C)   Temporary certificate of occupancy. A temporary certificate of
occupancy may be granted by the building official, or his or her designee, to
allow occupancy of all or a portion of a building provided certain requirements
are satisfied, but when all of the requirements that would allow for the
issuance of a full certificate of occupancy have not been satisfied. A
temporary certificate of occupancy shall not be issued when there are
incomplete health or life safety code requirements in the space for which
temporary occupancy is being requested.
      (1)   In making a request for a temporary certificate of occupancy, the
permit applicant shall submit the following:
         (a)   A written summary detailing the nature of and reason for the
request, the intended schedule for full project completion, and a list of the
remaining incomplete work as required under the approved building permit;
         (b)   The clerical fee in the amount of $80 for one- and two-family
residential construction permits, and $160 for commercial, industrial,
institutional, and multi-family residential construction permits; and
         (c)   Payment in the amount of $80 for each additional required
inspection.
      (2)   A temporary certificate of occupancy shall be valid for a time
period as established by the building official, or his or her designee.

      (2)   Round trip – valid for 14 calendar days; and
   (F)   Permits for vehicles that are oversized (height or length) or
overweight are only valid a half hour before sunrise until a half hour after
sunset, on any day for which a permit issued by the Illinois Department of
Transportation is valid.
   (G)   The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the
permittee and the village that the move described in the application will take
place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report any
inaccuracies or errors on the part of the village or the permittee to the
Village Engineering Department, prior to moving any load. Undertaking the move
is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and that:
      (1)   The permittee is in compliance with all operation requirements;
      (2)   All height, length and weight limitations specified in the permit;
      (3)   All operation, registration and license requirements;
      (4)   All financial responsibilities, obligations and other legal
requirements; and
      (5)   The permitee assumes all responsibility for injury or damage to
persons or to public or private property, including his or her own, or to the
object being transported, caused directly or indirectly by the transportation
or movement of vehicles and objects under the permit. The permittee agrees to
hold the village harmless from all suits, claims, damages, or proceedings of
any kind and to indemnify the village for any claim it may be required to pay
arising from the movement.
   (H)   The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of
the authority granted by the permit for the use of roads within the
jurisdiction of the village. Any vehicle and/or load found to be operating on
village roadways not specified on its permit will be considered to be off route
and without a permit. Permits shall be in the drivers possession at all times
and shall be exhibited upon demand by any enforcement officer, police officer
or other authorized village official. Permits may be displayed electronically
so long as it is accessible to any of the above listed authorized agents upon
demand.
   (I)   Any vehicle(s) and/or load that is found to be divisible will render
the permit null and void. The entire gross weight and axle weights of the
vehicle(s) with the load will then be subject to legal weights as defined in
625 ILCS 5/15-111. It is the duty of the applicant to verify the non-
divisibility of the vehicle(s) before applying for the permit. The permit
itself is prima facie evidence that the applicant confirmed the vehicle(s) and/
or load was non-divisible.
   (J)   If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the
proper utilities notified, property moved, bridge or highway analysis performed
and completed in advance of any permit movement.
   (K)   All movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
The Village Engineer or their designee holds the right to change any
requirements or provisions of the permit or permit process as deemed rationally
related to the interests of the village.
   (L)   Permits are null and void if altered for the purpose of deception.
Permits issued under this section constitute the grant of a privilege by the
village and may be denied or suspended for such reasons as the village may deem
rationally related to its governmental interests.
   (M)   The village with respect to streets and highways under its
jurisdiction shall collect a fee as shown herein from applicants for the
issuance of a permit to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles,
and/or loads, which fit the categories shown. Any axle or gross weight greater
than the maximum weights set forth in this section is subject to special
assessment and investigation to determine appropriate fees.

directed to place and maintain, or cause to be placed and maintained, in each
and every street intersecting a through street designated in this article, at
or near the property line of the through street, appropriate signs upon the
street to bear the word “STOP” and to be located so as to be clearly legible at
a distance of at least 100 feet along the street intersecting the through
street. All such signs shall conform to such standards as may be established by
state statute. All such signs shall be illuminated at night or be so placed as
to be illuminated by street lights or by the headlights of approaching

signs prohibiting construction traffic, and any other sign regulating traffic
and parking as deemed necessary by the corporate authorities, required by state
statute, or otherwise authorized in this code. No such regulations shall be
effective unless such signs are in place. In determining at what locations
signs shall be placed prohibiting construction traffic, the Director of Public
Works shall consider the damage to unfinished, new or existing roads which
would take place if construction traffic were permitted to traverse the roads.
Signs prohibiting the passage of construction traffic shall not be in place for
a period of more than one year without the prohibition being acted upon by the

fine of $25 and a maximum fine of $750 for each violation.
   (C)   The provisions of this section shall not apply where a motor vehicle
is operated on a sidewalk, upon the unpaved portion of a public right-of-way or
upon public property to avoid injury to a person or persons and/or to avoid

provided, however, that, the vehicle may be towed if the owner permitted the
tow to be made when the vehicle was reported stolen or at any time thereafter,
in the form provided. Within a working period of 24 hours after towing a
vehicle pursuant to this article, a notice shall be sent to or personally
delivered to the owner of the vehicle, affording the opportunity for a hearing.
For the purpose of this article, a working period of 24 hours shall not include
Saturday, Sunday and holidays.
   (C)   Towing with prior notice; abandoned vehicles. Abandoned vehicles may
be towed after the mailing or delivery of prior notice and the affording of an
opportunity for a hearing as provided in §§
8-3-3 and
8-3-4.
§ 8-3-3 PRE-TOW NOTICE FOR ABANDONED VEHICLES.
   (A)   Notice pursuant to this section shall be personally delivered to the
owner, or shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in the most
current registration list of the Secretary of State. The notice shall be in the
form provided. In the event that an out-of-state vehicle is proposed to be
towed, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the Secretary
of State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current
registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be
mailed as provided herein to the address furnished, though in no case will the
village be required to delay towing more than seven days after the date of the
mailing or personal delivery of the notice if no request for a hearing has been
received within that seven-day period.
   (B)   A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest date upon which
the tow may take place and the address and phone number of the Police
Department shall be placed on the vehicle.
§ 8-3-4 PRE-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner or person entitled to possession of
a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven days after the
date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a
pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be towed,
if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven-day
period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this article will be
deemed waived.
   (B)   Scheduling of pre-tow hearings. The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled
for a date within 14 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the pre-tow
notice. The village shall not be required to delay towing longer than such a
14-day period.
   (C)   Request for pre-tow hearings. Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be
made in person to the office indicated on the notice. Requests for hearing by
persons who reside more than 50 miles from the village may be made by mail.
Forms for such requests shall be made available at the Police Department. At
the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date and
time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.
   (D)   Appointment of Hearing Officer. The village shall choose an officer or
employee of the village to serve as Hearing Officer. In no case shall the
Hearing Officer be an individual who was involved in the initial decision to
tow the vehicle. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to require the
presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow or any other
village personnel.
   (E)   Nature of hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant
evidence, the Hearing Officer shall make a written decision based upon a
preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized
by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the village, with a specific
statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall be
provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Decision to tow and rates to be charged. If the preponderance of the
evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this article,
the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and
storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees to be charged
for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by
the Chief of Police pursuant to the provisions of §
8-3-5. The owner of such vehicle, having had such a hearing, may avoid the
towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location to a
proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle.
   (G)   Decision not to tow.
      (1)   If the preponderance of the evidence fails to support towing of the
vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle shall not be towed.
The village shall furnish a copy of such decision to the owner, who may place
it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible from the outside, such as
the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which such a decision has been
rendered shall be towed by the village unless the circumstances under which the
decision was rendered have changed.
      (2)   If, at some subsequent time, the village should wish to tow the
vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required
for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.
   (H)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. Originals
or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports and any
associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police
Department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after
each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The village or the owner may
contest the decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
§ 8-3-5 POST-TOW NOTICE FOR HAZARDOUS AND UNLAWFUL VEHICLES.
   (A)   Mailing or delivery of notice. Notice pursuant to this section shall
be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the
address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in the most current
registration list of the Secretary of State, unless the notice is personally
delivered to the owner, in which case, the date and time of the delivery and
the name of the police officer making the delivery shall be noted in the Police
Department records or reports. The notice shall be in the form provided, and
shall be mailed or delivered within 24 hours, Monday through Friday, excluding
holidays. In the event that the village has towed an out-of-state, hazardous or
unlawful vehicle, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the
Secretary of State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the
most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and
notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished.
   (B)   Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing service
operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least
12 inches by 18 inches, indicating the opportunity and procedures for a hearing
to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign shall be placed in
locations readily visible to the public transacting business at any towing
facility. If a towing service operator performs services for more than one
municipality, the information for contacting the various appropriate municipal
officers can be listed on one such sign.
   (C)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in
person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or
personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle,
whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be deemed
waived. Requests for hearings by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the
village may be made in person or by mail received by the village within the 15-
day period.
   (D)   Release of motor vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to
possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove same, the
owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his or
her identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his or her right to possession, sign
a receipt for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing and
storage fees to the towing service operator. The Police Chief is authorized to
promulgate regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to
establish these facts.
   (E)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates.
      (1)   The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing
and storage on police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts
to be administratively established by the Chief of Police and which may be
revised from time to time. The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the
form and on the sign concerning vehicle release requirements.
      (2)   However, nothing in this section is intended to prevent a
competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established
maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum
rates for various services, the Chief of Police shall consider such matters as
the prevalent market rates in the area for the different types of vehicles, the
types of storage and area requirements for categories such as large trucks and
commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of work required
to perform various types of towing operations. For particularly difficult or
unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious accidents, the Chief of Police is
authorized to allow towing operators to charge rates above those established
for normal situations, which special charges must be based upon the cost of
services provided, taking into account such matters as the man-hours and
equipment time required for the job. A towing service operator must fully
itemize in writing the details of such a billing at special rates for a
particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of the itemized bill
to the owner and to the Police Department. Any such special rates charged must
be customary in the towing industry in the area for the nature and extent of
the services provided. Every towing service operator and the Police Department
shall have available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any
special rate policy established by the Chief of Police, for vehicle owners to
view upon request.
§ 8-3-6 POST-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner of a vehicle towed as an immediate
tow, by or pursuant to the authority of the Police Department as set forth
herein, shall be provided the opportunity for a post-tow hearing to determine
the validity of such tow and any towing or storage charges. The hearing will
not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any
towed vehicle.
   (B)   Nature of the hearing and Hearing Officer. The nature of the hearing
and the appointment of the Hearing Officer shall be the same as set forth above
in §§
8-3-4 and
8-3-5.
   (C)   Scheduling of post-tow hearings. Hearings shall take place as follows.
      (1)   In those instances where the vehicle has been released upon the
deposit of the full payment currently owed for towing and storage charges, and
the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall take place within
15 days after the release of such vehicle, unless the owner requests a later
date convenient to all parties.
      (2)   In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded, the hearing
shall take place, at the option of the owner:
         (a)   On the next day after an owner’s demand for such hearing,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; if such demand is made after 3:00
p.m., or if the unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence creates a
particular difficulty in conducting the hearing on the next calendar day, then
a hearing shall be held on the second day following the request, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; or
         (b)   If acceptable to the owner, within 15 days of such request on
the date convenient to all parties.
   (D)   Conduct of post-tow hearing. The Hearing Officer shall review all
evidence presented by the vehicle owner and the Police Department or other
village employees, and shall make a finding based upon the preponderance of the
evidence presented, as to the lawful authority for the towing and storage of
the vehicle. The village must establish such authority by a preponderance of
the evidence.
   (E)   Post-tow hearing decision. For each hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
complete a post-tow hearing decision and attach such decision to the Police
Department’s original vehicle towing report, and supply a copy of the decision
to the owner by personal delivery if the owner is present, otherwise by mail.
The decision and findings shall be substantially as stated in the form for the
post-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. All
originals or copies of the notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports
and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police
Department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after
each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The village or the owner may
contest the decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
   (G)   Towing services subject to ordinance. Notwithstanding any other
ordinance or statutory provisions to the contrary, any towing service operator
authorized to perform tows on behalf of the village must perform its services
subject to the provisions of this article. However, the towing company shall
have the right to recover the reason-able value of its services for police-
ordered tows, which are not paid by the vehicle owner, from the village;
provided, however, that, if a tow or the charge for a tow is found by a court
to be illegal and the towing service operator is required to return the charge
for the tow to the owner of the vehicle, the village shall not be liable to
reimburse the operator for the towing charges.

secure facility owned, leased or operated by the private towing company.
   (B)   The police officer shall, at the time the vehicle is towed, notify or
make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner, lessee or person identifying

removal of the motor vehicle, and said motor vehicle is not required to be held
as evidence in regard to the violation, subject to forfeiture pursuant to 720
ILCS 5/36-1, or otherwise subject to impound pursuant to state law, the police
officer shall allow that individual to promptly remove the motor vehicle
without it being subject to seizure and impound. The police officer shall not

police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably
should have been discovered.

§ 8-8-6 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS.
   (A)   The administrative hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer who
shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois for at
least three years.
   (B)   Administrative hearing procedures shall be as follows.
      (1)   On the date of the initial hearing, the owner, any lessee and any
lienholder of record shall appear and either admit or deny probable cause for
the seizure and impound of the vehicle. If an admission is entered, or if the
owner, any lessee and any lienholder of record fail to appear, the case shall
be disposed of at that time, with an order/default order in favor of the
village, which order/default order shall require the payment to the village of
the $500 administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow
company, and the continued impound of the motor vehicle until the owner of
record, any lessee or lienholder of record pays to the village the $500
administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable towing
company. If the owner of record, any lessee or any lienholder of record enters
a denial, an evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled.
      (2)   All parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
testimony and evidence at the hearing. Continuances of the hearing date must be
made in person before the Hearing Officer and may be granted upon a showing of
good cause. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and
hearsay evidence shall be admissible, subject to the discretion of the Hearing
Officer.
      (3)   The original or a legible copy of the charging document signed by
the village officer certifying to the correctness of the information contained
therein shall be prima facie evidence of the facts specified therein.
      (4)   If the Hearing Officer determines by a preponderance of evidence
that the seizure and impound was proper, the Hearing Officer shall enter a
final order finding the owner of the vehicle liable to the village for the
administrative and public safety fee in the amount of $500. In the event a bond
was posted, it will be retained by the village as final payment of the
administrative and public safety fee. If the Hearing Officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the seizure and impound was not proper, the
Hearing Officer shall enter a final order for the return of the vehicle or the
bond. A finding that the seizure and impound was not proper shall not have any
bearing on whether the owner is obligated to pay the towing and storage fees
and costs, and the owner must pay all fees and costs owed to the private towing
company.
      (5)   The decision by the Hearing Officer on the issue of whether the
seizure and impound was proper, shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review pursuant to the
Illinois Administrative Review Act, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq., as now or
hereafter amended. A party must exhaust its administrative remedies prior to
seeking judicial review.

their right to a hearing.

§ 8-8-7 COLLECTION OF UNPAID ADMINISTRATIVE AND PUBLIC SAFETY FEE.
   (A)   If an administrative and public safety fee is imposed pursuant to this
article, the fee shall constitute a debt due and owing the Village of Carol
Stream. The village may collect on the debt using all means permitted by law,
including, without limitation, obtaining a judgment on the debt and enforcing
such judgment against the owner, or disposing of vehicle as unclaimed vehicle.
   (B)   The village may commence legal proceedings to collect an unpaid
administrative and public safety fee, or take actions to dispose of the
impounded vehicle:
      (1)   Thirty-five days after a determination was made at the requested
hearing that the seizure and impound was proper, and no petition was filed in
the Circuit Court seeking judicial review of the Administrative Hearing
Officer’s determination or other review;
      (2)   Thirty days after a final order is rendered by a judge of the
Circuit Court whenever a petition seeking judicial review was filed by a party;
or
      (3)   Fifteen days after the notice referenced in §
8-8-6, was mailed and the administrative hearing was waived in writing.

§ 8-8-8 RELEASE OF MOTOR VEHICLE NOT ALLOWED.
   (A)   The provisions of this article authorizing an owner, or other party,
to regain possession of a motor vehicle are not applicable when vehicle or
asset forfeiture proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug
asset forfeiture laws or 720 ILCS 5/36-1 et seq. or 720 ILCS 5/36.5. In such
case, the village shall not release, or dispose of, the vehicle to any person,
except as consistent with those proceedings.
   (B)   In the event the Carol Stream Police Department determines that the
vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to this article should not be released to
its owner or other persons, or disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle, due to the
need to retain the vehicle as part of a continuing criminal investigation, or
as evidence in a crime, then the village shall notify the owner that the
vehicle will be retained and not released, except as required by law.

§ 8-8-9 MULTIPLE OWNERS.
   Whenever in this article the word “owner” is used, it shall apply to all
owners. This article presumes that all owners have equal rights to a seized and
impounded vehicle. In instances of multiple owners of a vehicle, the village
shall not have any duty or responsibility to inquire or determine whether all
owners concur with, or object to, any action taken, or omissions, by any one
owner in relation to the vehicle seized and impounded.
(Ord. 2010-01-02, passed 1-19-2010; Ord. 2012-02-02, passed 2-6-2012)
§ 8-8-10 FAILURE TO CLAIM VEHICLE.
   Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30 days after the expiration
of the time during which the owner may seek judicial review of the Hearing
Officers decision or, if judicial review is sought, the time at which a final
judgment is rendered in favor of the village; or the time a final
administrative decision is rendered against any owner, lessee or lienholder of
record who fails to appear at the hearing, may be disposed of as abandoned and
unclaimed as provided by law; provided that, where proceedings have been
instituted under state or federal forfeiture laws, the village may not dispose
of the vehicle, except as consistent with the forfeiture proceedings.

the designated representatives of the village, in the absence of satisfactory
proof to the County Health Officer or village representatives that other
adequate means of waste disposal or removal have been provided, to inspect the
premises and remove therefrom any and all waste found thereon, for which
removal as established by the required fees shall be paid by the occupant(s),

be confined for a period of at least ten days for observation, or deliver, or
cause to be delivered, any such dog or animal to the Police Department for such
placement. In case such dog or animal is delivered to a veterinary hospital,
notice of the name and location of such hospital shall be immediately furnished
to the Police Department by the owner of such dog or animal, and upon receipt
of such dog or animal, the veterinary hospital shall submit to the Police
Department a certificate stating that such dog or animal either shows no
symptoms of rabies or does show symptoms of rabies. If, at the expiration of
the ten days of confinement in such veterinary hospital, the veterinary
hospital shall submit to the Police Department a second certificate stating
that the dog or animal does not have rabies, the dog or animal may then be
released by the Police Department.
   (B)   If such dog or animal should die during the interval of observation,
the intact brain shall forthwith be delivered to the laboratory of the State
Department of Public Health.
   (C)   If, however, evidence is presented that such dog or animal has been
inoculated against rabies within the time prescribed by law prior to the
biting, such dog or animal shall be confined in the house of its owner or in a
manner that will prohibit such dog or animal from biting any person for a
period of ten days, unless in the judgment of the Police Department or a
licensed veterinarian, circumstances are such that the dog or animal should be
confined elsewhere. Such dog or animal so confined shall be examined by a
licensed veterinarian on the first, fifth and tenth day during confinement. If,
at the expiration of the ten day confinement, the veterinarian shall submit a
certificate stating that the dog or animal does not have rabies, the dog or
animal may then be released by the Police Department.
   (D)   Any expense incurred in the handling of any dog or other animal under
this section shall be borne by the owner.

permit such dog to be at large within the village.
   (B)   If any dangerous dog, when it is necessary for the protection of any
person or property, cannot safely be taken up and impounded, such dog may be
slain by any police officer of the village; provided, however, that in all

such dog to immediately deliver the carcass and brain of such dog to the State
Department of Public Health.

causes property damage anywhere within the village or within one and one-half
miles of the boundaries of the village other than the owners.
      OWNER. Any person, partnership, corporation, or any other entity owning,
keeping, harboring or having care, custody or possession of an animal whether

            7.   Any individual animal which has been found to be a vicious
animal in another jurisdiction; and
            8.   A VICIOUS ANIMAL shall be one which exhibits the actions
provided within this section within the village or within one and one-half
miles of the boundaries of the village.
         (b)   Each act specified in divisions (a)1. through (a)7. of this
definition shall itself be sufficient to bring the act within the definition of
VICIOUS ANIMAL, and each such occurrence shall be a separate event upon which
an offense can be based.
         (c)   An animal shall not be found to be a dangerous or VICIOUS ANIMAL
if the behavior of the animal is exhibited only when it is teased, tormented,
abused or assaulted or when a trespass, tort or crime occurs on the premises
where the animals located at the time the action takes place or where the
animal is protecting or defending a human being within the immediate vicinity
from an attack or assault. Nor shall it apply to dogs while utilized by any
police department or any law enforcement official in the performance of police
work.
   (E)   The owner of an animal believed to be a dangerous or VICIOUS ANIMAL
shall be served a written notice by the village that it wishes to classify such
animal as dangerous or VICIOUS ANIMAL, the notice shall contain the

of such notice may request a hearing before an official of the village or at
the election of the Village President, a person selected by the Village
President to serve as a Hearing Officer to determine whether the animal should
be classified as a dangerous or vicious animal. At such hearing, the official
or Hearing Officer shall receive the evidence presented by the village as well
as other evidence as to the reasons why the animal should be declared a
dangerous or vicious animal. At that hearing either party may present any
competent evidence including the testimony of a person experienced in the
handling and temperament of animals. The official or Hearing Officer shall
within ten days after the hearing issue a written decision and order. That
order shall not be further appealed to any other person or body within the
village, but either the corporate authorities of the village or the owner of

shall assess the owner of that animal the amount of not less than $100 for a
first offense and $250 for a second offense. Each instance in which an animal
shall exhibit the characteristics of a dangerous animal shall be deemed a
separate offense. A person so assessed shall have the option of paying to the

characteristics of dangerous animal has occurred, the offense shall be
punishable by a fine of not less than $300, nor more than $750, for each
offense proven to have occurred.
   (G)   If the official or Hearing Officer should find that a person is the
owner of a vicious animal, he or she has an incidence to the privilege of
ownership or possession of the vicious animal, (which may be regulated through

animals), may require one or more of the following, which is found to be
reasonable necessary to protect the public safety and welfare:
      (1)   The placement in a prominent location on the property of the owner
of a clearly visible warning sign in specified size indicating that there is a
vicious animal on the premises and if a pen is required, a sign may be required
to be posted on that pen;
      (2)   A requirement that the animal, in order to go beyond the premises
of the owner, must be securely muzzled and restrained by a chain or leash or
its power to attack otherwise restrained and under the physical restraint of a
person. The muzzle shall be made in a manner which will not cause injury to the
animal or interfere with its vision or aspiration but shall prevent it from
biting any human or other animal;
      (3)   Presentation to the village of a photograph, which, at the request
of the village, may be taken by a village photographer, of the animal along
with a requirement that the animal be permanently required to wear a collar or
other means of identification through which it can be determined that the
animal in question has been classified as a vicious animal;
      (4)   The construction of a pen at a fixed location on the property of
the owner which pen may be required to be at least six feet in height forming
or causing an enclosure suitable to prevent the entry of young children and
suitable to confine a vicious animal in conjunction with other measures which
may be taken by the owner such as tethering of a vicious animal. Such pen shall
be securely enclosed and locked and designed with secure sides, and bottom, and
may be required to have a top and to be embedded into the ground and shall be
designed to prevent the animal from escaping. The construction of a pen shall
conform to the requirements of a dog run contained in §
6-12-12 of the village code;
      (5)   A requirement that if the animal is allowed to go out of doors on
the property of the owner that it will always be tied in place with either a
chain or a leash having a tensile strength of at least 300 pounds;
      (6)   The owner of a vicious animal may be allowed to take the vicious
animal out of doors when not within a pen or on a runline if it is necessary
for the owner to obtain veterinary care for the vicious animal or to comply
with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the vicious
animal must be securely muzzled and restrained with a chain or leash having a
tensile strength of at least 300 pounds and not exceeding five feet in length;
and the vicious animal shall during all such times be under the direct control
and supervision of the owner or keeper specifically chosen by the owner;
      (7)   To undertake any other reasonable restrictions and requirements
which will make the ownership or keeping of a vicious animal consistent with
the health and safety of the citizens of the village;
      (8)   The owner of a vicious animal may be required to present to the
village a certificate of insurance indicating that the owner has then in force
a liability or a homeowner’s insurance policy providing that the insurance
company will indemnify or pay on behalf of the owner any damages or personal
injuries caused by the vicious animal. Such insurance policy shall contain such
coverage in an amount of not less than $100,000 and shall be issued by an
insurance company approved by the Village Attorney, who shall consider the
financial capabilities of the company, and shall, thereafter, be kept in full
force; and
      (9)   At intervals of no more often than one year, the official or
Hearing Officer may receive a petition from the owner affected seeking to
modify the conditions imposed.
   (H)   It shall be a violation of this code for a person to own or keep a
vicious animal or, after an animal is found to be a vicious animal, to fail to
take the corrective measures which are ordered as an incident of the power to
license and regulate acts possessed by the village. Upon a judicial
determination that a violation of this code has occurred, the offense shall be
punishable by a fine of not less than $400, nor more than $2,500, for each
offense proven to have occurred.
   (I)   No owner or keeper of a vicious animal shall sell or give away any
vicious animal unless the person receiving the animal is given a written notice
that the animal has been found to be a vicious animal.
   (J)   If an animal is believed to be a vicious animal or is found to be a
vicious animal and is not being kept under the restrictions and requirements
previously imposed, the individual animal in question my be immediately seized
and impounded. If an animal is seized and impounded, and the owner of the
animal can be determined, a post-seizure hearing will be held within ten days
by an official of the village or the Hearing Officer appointed by the Village
President. At that hearing, it shall be determined if the animal seized poses
an imminent threat to human beings or domestic animals or a continuing threat
to property or whether the owner of the animal is unable or unwilling to take
the precautions necessary to prevent the animal from posing the threat or to
follow the restrictions and requirements previously ordered. Within seven days
after the hearing, the village official or Hearing Officer shall render a
written decision. That decision may be appealed to the Village Board and
thereafter in such manner as such manner decisions may be destroyed, require
the animal to be permanently removed from the village, or such other action as
may be deemed adequate to alleviate the imminent threat. If a determination is
made that the animal does not pose an imminent threat, or has not violated the
provisions of previously imposed restrictions and requirements, then the
village shall pay all expenses, including shelter, food, veterinary expenses.
But if the determination is that the actions of the animal do pose an imminent
threat, or that a violation of the previously imposed restriction and
requirements have taken place, then the owner shall pay such expenses. When an
animal is impounded, pursuant to this section, at the owner’s request and
expense, such impoundment may, at the election of the village, be at a
veterinary and/or licensed kennel of the owner’s choosing.
§ 9-3-12 LIMITATION OF ANIMALS.

months of age, nor more than four cats or other domestic animals to be or
remain in or about any premises, building or lot within the village under his

ARTICLE 5: FEEDING OF WILD ANIMALS PROHIBITED
Section

9-5-2   Definitions
   
9-5-3   Prohibitions
   
9-5-4   Violation and enforcement
§ 9-5-1 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this article is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the community and its wildlife by prohibiting the feeding of wild animals and
waterfowl on public and private property in the village. The feeding waterfowl
and other wild animals increases the potential for damage to public parks and
private property. It also elevates the potential for the spread of disease in
people and companion animals. In addition, it is the intent of this article to
protect the welfare of the waterfowl and wild animals themselves. Wildlife
studies have shown that feeding waterfowl and other wild animals can interrupt
their normal migration patterns, can make them more aggressive in demanding
food, cause nutritional problems, expose them to danger by eliminating their
natural fear of predators, and promote the spread of diseases and disease-
carrying parasites.
(Ord. 2017-06-23, passed 6-5-2017)

association, or political subdivision of this state subject to municipal
jurisdiction.
   WATERFOWL. Wildfowl of the order Anseriformes, especially members of the

   WILD ANIMAL. Any animal, which is not normally domesticated in this state,
including but not limited to coyotes, deer, feral cats, foxes, groundhogs,
squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rats, rabbits, opossums, raccoons, skunks, and
waterfowl.
(Ord. 2017-06-23, passed 6-5-2017)
§ 9-5-3 PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   No person shall purposely or knowingly, feed or in any manner provide
access to food to any wild animal or waterfowl within the corporate limits of
the village, on lands either publicly or privately owned. Feeding does not
include baiting in the legal taking of fish and/or game.
   (B)   Feeding of songbirds and other backyard birds, not including
waterfowl, shall be permitted outdoors at such times and in such a manner that:
      (1)   The feeding does not create an unreasonable disturbance with
wildlife;
      (2)   Any feed must be placed within a bird feeder with a maximum volume
of not more than one cubic foot, placed at least four feet above ground.
      (3)   Bird feeders are placed where wildlife other than songbirds and

§ 10-10-1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses within the municipality in order to promote the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the municipality. The provisions of this
article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication,
including sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose nor
effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this article to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.

§ 10-10-2 FINDINGS.
   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses presented to the municipality from findings incorporated in
the cases of City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000),
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Renton v. Playtime
Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S.

1989), Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d. 1243 (9th Cir. 1982), Bamon
Corp. v. City of Dayton, 730 F.Supp. 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990), and EWAP, Inc. v.
City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App. 3d 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. (1979), and on studies
in other cities including the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on
the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (Minnesota, 1989), Memorandum
re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance, of the Assistant Chief of Police of Tucson,
Arizona (May 1, 1990), Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., Report to the American Center
for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses (March
31, 1996), Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis (1984),
and McCleary,
Richard, Ph.D., and Meeker, James W., Ph.D., Final Report to the City of Garden
Grove: The Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden
Grove Boulevard, (Garden Grove, CA, October 23, 1991), the President and Board
of Trustees find as follows.
   (A)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities.
   (B)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos or live sexually oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
   (C)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
   (D)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
   (E)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films concealed from public view.
   (F)   The findings noted in divisions (A) through (E) above raise compelling
and substantial governmental concerns.
   (G)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and
substantial governmental concerns.
   (H)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place
the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore non-existent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the municipality. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
   (I)   The regulation of nudity, semi-nudity and physical contact between
employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the
compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution
and other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety and welfare.
   (J)   Requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and
requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of
the provisions of this article and other federal, state and local laws, thereby
furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting
the public health, safety and welfare.
   (K)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government
interest in protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
   (L)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime
is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business.
   (M)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
   (N)   Studies in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between
sexually oriented businesses and crime, including sex-related crimes like
prostitution, obscenity and sexual assault. This correlation is especially
acute when more than one sexually oriented business is located in a
neighborhood and when a sexually oriented business is located near a business
licensed to serve alcoholic beverages.
   (O)   Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a connection
between sexually oriented businesses and organized crime.

         (c)   Criminal activity occurring in the rental unit or on the
premises that is directly relating to domestic violence or sexual violence,
engaged in by a tenant, member of a tenant's household, guest, or other party,
and against a tenant, household member, guest or other party.

property agent to knowingly permit any tenant to occupy any residential rental
property without entering into a crime free lease addendum or to occupy any
residential rental property in violation of any provision of the crime free
lease addendum required under this section. Any failure to include a crime-free
lease addendum or similar approved language may result in suspension or
revocation of the residential rental license. Any failure of an owner to take

having been notified by the Police Department of activity or conduct occurring
on the residential rental property in violation of the addendum, and after
having been given a reasonable opportunity to remedy such activity or conduct,
shall be sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of his or her
residential rental license.
   (G)   Inspections.
      (1)   In the event that the Village Manager finds that it is necessary to
determine whether the location in connection with which such license has been
requested is in compliance with this article and with the applicable
ordinances, rules and regulations of the village, an inspection may be required
prior to and as a condition of issuance of the license. After inspection, no
such license shall be issued unless the location is found to meet all
applicable requirements of this article and applicable ordinances, including
but not limited to the International Building Code, the NFPA 70 National
Electric Code, the Illinois Plumbing Code, the International Mechanical Code,
the International Fire Code, the International Residential Code, the
International Property Maintenance Code, the International Fuel Gas Code, the
International Energy Conservation Code, and the Swimming Pool and Spa Code,
latest adopted editions, and any amendments to such codes as are adopted by the
village.
      (2)   Property that changes ownership may be required to be inspected
before a new license can be issued. After inspection, no such license shall be
issued unless the location is found to meet all applicable requirements of this
article and applicable ordinances, rules and regulations of the village.
         (a)   Whenever, upon inspection of the location, the Director of
Community Development or his designee finds that conditions or practices exist
which are in violation of the provisions of this article or of any applicable
ordinances, rules and regulations, the owner shall be served with notice of
such violation in the manner hereinafter provided. Such notice shall state that
unless the violations cited are corrected within reasonable time, the license
may be suspended.
         (b)   At the end of the time allowed for correction of any violation
cited, the Director of Community Development or his designee shall re-inspect
the location, and if the re-inspection reveals that such conditions have not
been corrected, a request to the Village Manager to suspend the license may be
made.
         (c)   Any person whose license has been recommended for suspension
shall be entitled to an appeal to the Village Manager in the manner provided by
this title. Any written request for appeal shall be filed with the Village
Manager within 15 days following the issuance of the notice.
         (d)   If, upon re-inspection, the Director of Community Development or
his designee finds that the location in connection with which the notice was
issued is now in compliance with this article and with the applicable
ordinances, rules and regulations, a recommendation of the reinstatement of the
license may be made to the Village Manager.
         (e)   When the Director of Community Development or his designee
determines after an initial inspection that additional follow up inspections
are necessary for enforcement of this article, two additional follow up
inspections for noncompliance shall be granted each license holder without
charge. In the event more than two follow up inspections are needed, the
license holder shall be assessed a noncompliance inspection service charge in
the amount of $60 per division/inspection type required to make the re-
inspection. Payments must be made in full prior to the license being renewed.
Failure to pay any balance will serve as grounds to deny further permits or
licenses from being issued by the village.
   (H)   The owners and their designated property agents shall be responsible
for informing their tenants of any scheduled inspection or re-inspection of any
residential rental property; and they shall be responsible for requesting
permission from any person whose consent is necessary for village inspector to
enter the property if that person is not home at the time of the inspection or
re-inspection. The village shall provide notice to both the owner and the
tenant, on a form provided by the village, of the tenant's right to refuse
consent to the residential licensing inspection and to require the village to
obtain an administrative search warrant. If any tenant, occupant or other
person in control and/or possession and whose consent to inspect is necessary
concerning a residential rental property or a dwelling unit contained therein
fails or refuses to consent to access and entry to the property or dwelling
unit under his or her control for any residential licensing inspection required
by this article, the code official or his or her designee may apply to the
circuit court for an administrative search warrant. The application for the
administrative search warrant shall specify the basis upon which the warrant is
being sought and shall include a statement that the inspection shall be limited
to a determination whether there are any violations of the minimum standards of
the village. Nothing set forth herein shall limit the right of a tenant to
grant the village access to the dwelling unit.

      (1)   All licensees may be represented by an attorney who is licensed to
practice in Illinois. All attorneys who appear in a representative capacity on
behalf of a licensee must file a written appearance setting forth:
         (a)   The name, address and telephone number of the attorney;
         (b)   The name and address of the licensee the attorney represents;
and
         (c)   An affirmative statement that the attorney is licensed to

notice of proposed disciplinary action by a preponderance of the evidence.
   (F)   Evidence.
      (1)   The hearing need not be conducted according to the technical rules
of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be admitted and shall be sufficient in
itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of
the existence of any common law or statute that might make improper the
admission of evidence over objection in a civil action. Hearsay may support a
finding of the Liquor Commissioner if it is the best evidence available, has
sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and reliability and is of the type
reasonably and customarily relied on in the gaming industry.
         (a)   If relevant, and not precluded from the hearing by section 6(d)
of the Illinois Gambling Act, 230 ILCS 10/6(d), relating to all licensed
applicants, the official Illinois Gaming Board records or certified copies of
the records shall be admissible into evidence if the records tend to prove or
disprove an allegation contained in the complaint.
         (b)   Official Illinois Gaming Board records are documents either
prepared by or provided to the Illinois Gaming Board for the purpose of
conducting its regular business.
         (c)   If relevant and not precluded from the hearing by a statute,
regulation or ordinance, official village records or certified copies of the
records shall be admissible into evidence.
         (d)   Official village records are documents either prepared by or
provided to the village for the purpose of conducting its regular business.
      (2)   The parties should, to the fullest extent possible, stipulate to
all matters that are not or fairly should not be in dispute.
      (3)   The parties may make objections to evidentiary offers. When an
objection is made, the Liquor Commissioner may receive the disputed evidence
subject to a ruling at a later time.
      (4)   The Liquor Commissioner may take official notice of any generally
accepted information or technical or scientific matter within the field of
video gaming, and any other fact that may be judicially noticed by courts of
this state. The parties shall be informed of any information, matter or facts
so noticed, including any village staff memoranda or data, and shall be given
reasonable opportunity to refute that information.
   (G)   Prohibition on ex parte communication. No licensee or its
representative shall communicate directly or indirectly with the Liquor
Commissioner regarding any pending disciplinary matter, except upon notice to
and opportunity for all parties to participate.
   (H)   Hearing.
      (1)   Upon conclusion of the hearing the Liquor Commissioner shall render
a written order including written findings of fact and conclusions of law on
which the Liquor Commissioner's decision is based. The findings of fact shall
be based exclusively on the evidence and on matters officially noticed.
      (2)   Copies of the Liquor Commissioner's final order shall be served on
the licensee by personal delivery, certified mail or overnight express mail to
licensee's last known address.
      (3)   The Liquor Commissioner's final order shall become effective upon
personal delivery to the licensee or upon posting by certified or overnight
express mail to applicant's last known address.
   (I)   Sanctions and penalties.
      (1)   The Liquor Commissioner may impose sanctions and penalties if the
Liquor Commissioner finds that a party has acted in bad faith, for the purpose
of delay, or has otherwise abused the hearing process. Such sanctions and
penalties include, but are not limited to, default judgment or directed finding
on one or more issues.
      (2)   If a licensee fails to testify on his or her own behalf with
respect to any question propounded to him or her, the Liquor Commissioner may
infer that such testimony or answer would have been adverse to the licensee's
case.
      (3)   Failure of a licensee to appear at a hearing or scheduled
proceeding shall constitute an admission of all matters and facts contained in
the complaint. In such cases the Liquor Commissioner may take action based upon
that admission or upon any other evidence, including affidavits, without any
further notice to the licensee.
   (J)   Penalties.
      (1)   The Liquor Commissioner may impose fines, suspend, revoke or
restrict any license issued under this chapter or impose other disciplinary
action for any act or failure to act by the licensee or by the licensee's
agents or employees that violates any provision of the Video Gaming Act or the
regulations promulgated under the Video Gaming Act or this chapter.
      (2)   Any person, firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, or other entity recognized in law who violates any provision of this
chapter for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall be subject
to a fine of not less than $150 nor more than $1,500. Each and every day that a
violation occurs or exists shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for
which a fine may be imposed. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the
village shall have available to it all remedies in law or in equity or as may
be otherwise provided for by the ordinances of the village.
      (3)   Every gambling device found in a licensed video gaming location in
the village operating gambling games in violation of this chapter shall be
subject to seizure and confiscation, and shall be turned over to the Illinois
Gaming Board as provided in Section 1800.1110 of the Illinois Administrative
Code.
      (4)   Any village liquor license issued by the Liquor Commissioner under
the provisions of
Chapter 11 of this Code to any operator of a licensed video gaming location
that operates or permits the operation of a video gaming terminal within its
establishment in violation of this chapter may be immediately revoked.
(Ord. 2020-09-29, passed 9-21-2020)
§ 10-14-16 STATE - LOCAL RELATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever the village takes any action authorizing or prohibiting the
licensing operation, or use of video gaming terminals in the village it shall
notify the Illinois Gaming Board of such action.
   (B)   Whenever the village or the Liquor Commissioner takes action relating
to the operation or use of a video gaming terminal in the village, whether
licensed or unlicensed, the Illinois Gaming Board shall be notified and the
notice shall specify the extent of the action taken and the reasons for the
action. The village and the Liquor Commissioner shall thereupon take whatever
action is necessary under the Act. If the village confiscated video gaming
terminals or terminal income, the village shall, as soon as practicable under
the circumstances, turn over the video gaming terminals and terminal income to
the Illinois Gaming Board unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

§ 11-2-8 RECORD OF LICENSES.
   The Liquor Control Commissioner shall keep, or cause to be kept, a complete
record of all such licenses issued, and shall furnish the Treasurer, Chief of
Police and Village Clerk each with a copy thereof. Upon the issuance of a new
license, or the revocation of any old license, the Liquor Control Commissioner
shall give written notice of such action to each of these officers within 48
hours of such action.
§ 11-2-9 DISPOSITION OF FEES.
   (A)   All such license fees shall be paid to the Liquor Control Commissioner
at the time application for license is made, and shall be forthwith turned over
to the Village Treasurer for deposit in the general village accounts. In the
event the application is denied, the fee shall be returned to the applicant.
   (B)   If the license is granted, the fee shall be deposited as set forth
above, and no portion thereof shall be refunded.
§ 11-2-10 DRAM SHOP INSURANCE.
   No license shall be granted to any applicant until such applicant shall
furnish evidence satisfactory to the Liquor Control Commissioner that such
applicant is covered by a policy of dram shop insurance issued by a responsible
insurance company authorized and licensed to do business in the state insuring
such applicant and the owner of the premises against liability in the minimum
amount of $100,000 each for liability, one person, means of support and

law.
§ 11-2-11 LICENSE RENEWAL.
   (A)   Each licensee shall make application for renewal of his or her license
to the Liquor Control Commissioner not less than one month prior to the end of
the licensing period. The annual fee for the license must accompany this
renewal application. If the Liquor Control Commissioner determines that the
renewal application contains information that is in any way changed from the
original application for license, in which case a new investigation of the
license is necessary, a fee of $375 shall be charged to the licensee to cover
the costs of such investigation, in addition to the yearly license fee.
   (B)   If, after investigation, it is determined that the applicant is not
entitled to a renewal license, the yearly license fee shall be returned. The
charge for the investigation is non-refundable.
   (C)   A renewal license shall be issued provided the licensee is entitled to
receive a license and provided that the premises for which renewal license is
sought are suitable for such purposes; pro-vided further that the renewal
privilege herein provided for shall not be construed as a vested right which
shall in any case prevent the corporate authorities from decreasing the number
of licenses to be issued within the village.
   (D)   In the event that the village shall reduce the number of licenses
below that number issued in the prior year and the number of applicants do not
decrease such as to be equal to or less than the number of available licenses,
the Liquor Control Commissioner may issue the available licenses on the basis
of date of application, years holding prior licenses, adequate service to areas
in village, record of violation or any other reasonable basis.
§ 11-2-12 DISPLAYING LICENSE.
   Every licensee shall cause his or her license to be framed and hung in plain
view in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.
§ 11-2-13 DUPLICATE LICENSE.

§ 11-2-14 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   A license shall be a purely personal privilege, good for not to exceed one
year after issuance unless sooner revoked or suspended as provided in this
article, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to
attachment, garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable or
transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily or subject to being encumbered or
hypothecated. Such license shall cease upon the death of the licensee, and
shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution, provided that
executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased licensee, and the
trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in
part of alcoholic liquor under the order of the appropriate court, and may
exercise the privileges of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after
the death of such decedent, or such insolvency or bankruptcy, until the
expiration of such license, but not longer than six months after the death,
bankruptcy or insolvency of such license.
§ 11-2-15 CHANGE IN PERSONNEL.
   (A)   Any changes in partnerships, officers, directors, persons holding
directly or beneficially more than 5% of the stock or ownership interest, or
managers of establishments licensed under this article, shall be reported in
writing to the Liquor Control Commissioner within ten days of the change. All
new personnel shall meet all the standards of this article and must otherwise
qualify to hold a liquor license. All such changes in personnel shall be
subject to review by the Liquor Control Commissioner. In each case, a new
investigation shall be completed, with the licensee paying an investigation
charge of $375. Such investigation charge is non-refundable.
   (B)   When a license has been issued to a partnership and a change of
ownership occurs resulting in a partnership interest by one who is not eligible
to hold a liquor license, such license shall terminate.
   (C)   When a license has been issued to a corporation and a change takes
place in officers, directors, managers or shareholders of more than 5% of the
stock, resulting in the holding of office or such shares of stock by one who is
not eligible for a license, such license shall terminate.
   (D)   When a license has been issued to an individual who is no longer
eligible for a license, such license shall terminate.
§ 11-2-16 CHANGE OF PREMISES NAME.
   Written application to the Liquor Control Commissioner must be made before
the name of the premises holding the liquor license can be changed. If the
Liquor Control Commissioner determines that there is no other change to the
original application, except for the name of the premises, the license issued
in the former name shall become null and void and a license shall be issued in
the new name at no charge to the licensee.
§ 11-2-17 CHANGE OF LOCATION.
   A retail liquor dealer’s license shall permit the sale of alcoholic liquor
only in the premises described in the application and license. Such location
may be changed only upon the written permission to make such change issued by
the Liquor Control Commissioner. No change of location shall be permitted
unless the proposed new location is a proper one for the retail sale of
alcoholic liquor under the laws of this state and the ordinances of the
village. Such relocation may only be permitted if ownership of the premises
remains the same. When a change of location is desired by the licensee, an
investigation of the new premises shall be completed by the village, with the
licensee paying an investigation charge of $375. Such investigation charge is
non-refundable.
§ 11-2-18 RECOVERY OF FEES.

§ 12-2-1 BUILDING NUMBERING SYSTEM ESTABLISHED.
   In order to maintain uniformity and continuity in the number of postal
addresses in the village, and to show the location of addresses to Fire and
Police Departments and other agencies requiring ready knowledge of building
locations, the system of grid building numbering set forth hereinafter is
hereby established.
§ 12-2-2 BASE LINES.
   The 100 north, 100 south base line of the numbering system of the village is
a line running east and west parallel to section lines, and such base line
shall run through the center of the intersection of Gary Avenue and North
Avenue, and the 100 east, 100 west base line is a line running north and south
down the centerline of the public right-of-way of Gary Avenue.
§ 12-2-3 NUMBERS PER MILE.
   There shall be an assumed 500 building numbers per mile. Building numbers
shall be assigned on the basis of number of feet of street frontage, in
increments of 21 feet per odd or even number. Only one number will be assigned
per occupiable building or dwelling unit and this number shall be the number
given by the addition of the last increment of 21 feet. Thus, if a building has
a street frontage of 60 feet and is the first building on the even side of the
street, it will be assigned the number “106”.
§ 12-2-4 STREET NUMBERS TO BE DISPLAYED; SIZE; LOCATION.
   (A)   All buildings in the village must display street numbers of the
building address. Buildings under construction shall display building numbers
prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit.
   (B)   The street numbers must be displayed in a prominent place on the main
building, contrasting from the background and clearly visible from the traveled
portion of the street on which the building is located, and must be at least
six inches high.
   (C)   The street numbers shall be in Arabic numerals and placed to the left,
right or above the main entrance doorway. If this location is not visible from
the street, the numerals may be located near the garage doorway or any other
portion of the building which is clearly visible from the roadway.
§ 12-2-5 EVEN, ODD NUMBERS.
   All even numbers in the numbering system of the village shall fall on the
south and west sides of the streets, and all odd numbers shall fall on the
north and east sides of the streets.
§ 12-2-6 NUMBERING ON ADJACENT, ABUTTING STREETS.
   On streets that abut but do not cross, buildings on the corner thus formed
shall be determined to face the street where the bulk of the building lies on
the side of a line which is the bisector of such street angle intersection.
§ 12-2-7 NUMBERING TO BE CONTINUOUS; CHANGES IN DIRECTIONS.
   Building numbering shall be continuous down each individual street,
regardless of the change in general direction of the street. Such directions
shall be based on the basic or established direction of such street. Where it
becomes apparent that the general direction of any street has made a long
continuous change, the change of number shall be made at a street crossing
only.

§ 12-3-1 STREET NAMES.
   Street names within the planning jurisdiction of the village shall be chosen
so that they are of a simple phonetic spelling and so that no conflict will be
created with the names of existing village streets. For streets within planned
unit developments or property developed by the same developer, the street names
shall be chosen to carry out a single theme of the development in which the
particular street is located. The developer, in coordination with the

conditions:
         (a)   Tree replacements based upon village removal.
            1.   If a tree within the ROWs under the jurisdiction of the
village is removed by the village, the village may plant one or more trees,
subject to sufficient space therefor.
            2.   The adjacent property owner may be afforded the opportunity to
provide input on the species of tree to be planted, in accordance with the tree
species list; however, the village shall make the final determination of the
species, based on the tree species available to the village and in accordance

         (b)   Trees requested by the adjacent property owner.
            1.   If an adjacent property owner requests that the village plant
a tree within the ROWs under the jurisdiction of the village, and no tree was
previously removed by the village from the location in question, subject to
sufficient space therefor, the village may, subject to the availability of a
tree and whether parkway trees were not required in the area at the time of
development, plant a tree at the location in question; provided the adjacent
property owner pays the full planting fee per tree to the village, prior to the
planting of the tree.
            2.   The adjacent property owner may be afforded the opportunity to
provide input on the species of tree to be planted, in accordance with the tree
species list; however, the village shall make the final determination of the
species, based on the trees available to the village and in accordance with
species diversity goals.
            3.   Trees planted at the request of the adjacent property owner,
within the ROWs under the jurisdiction of the village, shall remain the
property of the village.
         (c)   If trees are planted by the village within the ROWs under the
jurisdiction of the village, as part of an approved development of the existing
adjacent property, which requires the planting of parkway trees by the
developer of said adjacent property, the adjacent property owner and/or
developer of the approved development shall be charged the cost of the tree and

Director.
         (a)   If a public tree is removed without authorization, or is
unlawfully damaged by any person, firm, or corporation to the point that the
tree may need to be removed and/or replaced, at the discretion of the Director
or designee, the offending entity may be charged the tree removal fee of $50
for removals of up to ten inches DBH and another $100 for each additional ten
inches DBH of the tree with a maximum fee of $500 per tree. This fee may be
waived with approval from the Director.
            1.   Said fee is in addition to the direct costs associated with
the restoration of the area including the potential replacement of the tree.

attach any cable, wire, signs, or any other object to any village-owned and
maintained public tree, without prior approval from the Public Works Director
or his/her designee.
         (d)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to
"top" any public tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, where
best pruning practices are impractical, may be temporarily exempted from this
provision at the determination of the Director.
         (e)   In the event of any site improvement which may impact public
property trees, a tree preservation plan is required, must be approved, and
implemented prior to the start of any work or delivery of any materials to the
building activity area. Details on tree preservation standards are included in
the Urban Forest Management Plan.
      (2)   Village tree removal. Trees located within the ROWs under the
jurisdiction of the village shall be removed by the village or a village
designee when removal is considered necessary by the village's Public Works
Department for reasons of tree health and/or public safety.
         (a)   Prior to such removal, the village will attempt to give notice
to the resident of the abutting property, stating the reason for the removal.
village staff has the authority to remove any tree located in the ROWs under
the jurisdiction of the village without providing the aforementioned notice,
when removal is considered necessary for public safety. In regard to any such
tree removal:
            1.   All stump removals shall require underground utility locations
prior to action. All stumps will be ground to a depth of at least 12 inches
below existing grade. Stump grindings will be removed, replaced with topsoil
and restored with grass seed.
            2.   Any tree located in the ROWs under the jurisdiction of the
village, that is removed, will be replaced during the next available planting
season, provided there is sufficient funding and spacing, for the planting of a
tree, and sufficient funding for planting a replacement tree. If the adjacent
resident does not desire a new tree be planted such request must be submitted
to the Director of Public Works who shall make the final determination on the
request.
            3.   There shall be no fee charged to the adjacent property owner
for a tree removed by the village from the ROWs under the jurisdiction of the
village.
      (3)   Developer/adjacent property owner removed trees. The fee for the
removal of a tree from the ROW under the jurisdiction of the village, at the
request of either the adjacent property owner or the developer of the adjacent
property, where the Director has determined that the tree does not otherwise
need to be removed, and the village consents to the removal, shall be based
upon the following formula:
         (a)   All tree removal applications have a $50 fee that covers
removals of up to ten inches DBH and may be waived with the approval of the
Director. There shall be an additional fee of $100 for each additional ten
inches DBH of the tree with a maximum fee of $500 per tree. Said fee shall be
paid to the village prior to the removal of the tree and is in addition to the
direct costs associated with removing the tree. This fee may be waived with
approval from the Director and consent of the Tree Commission.
      (4)   Removal of unauthorized plantings/landscaping. If the Director, or
their designee, deems a planting is unauthorized, and/or landscaping and
hardscaping around public trees is unauthorized and/or is harming the health of
the public tree, the village may require the property owner remove any
unauthorized planting/landscaping within ten business days without compensation
to the property owner. If the property owner fails to comply, the village may
remove any unauthorized plantings/landscaping within any public place without
compensation to the owner.
      (5)   Developer tree removal on private property. The Village of Carol
Stream Community Development Department and village arborist may assist private
developers with creating a tree preservation plan for trees located on private
property. (See §
16-5-6(E) Landscape Tree preservation)
   (F)   Property owner responsibility. Property owners are responsible
parties. No property owner shall allow a tree, or other plant growing on his or
her property, to obstruct or interfere with pedestrians or vehicles or the view
of drivers, thereby creating a hazard. If an obstruction persists, the Director
shall notify the property owner to prune or remove the tree or plant. If the
owner fails to comply with the notice, the village may undertake the necessary
work and charge the cost to the property owner.
   (G)   Certain trees declared a nuisance. Nuisance trees pose a health or
safety hazard to the village. Nuisance trees shall be regulated as described in
municipal code Article 9, Chapter 4 of the Village Code (Health Regulations-
Trees).
   (H)   Violations and penalty. Violations of this section. It shall be a
violation of this code for any person, firm, or corporation, to plant a tree in
a parkway or damage a parkway tree without written approval from the Director.
Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this section,
unless otherwise specified, shall be punishable in accordance with §
1-1-9.
      (1)   In addition to seeking the payment of a fine in accordance with §
1-1-9, the village, when it believes that a violation of this section has
occurred, may remove any tree or other unauthorized planting placed within the
parkway and take any other legal action to enforce its property rights.
      (2)   The village shall also maintain its right to seek restitution for
the costs associated with the removal, restoration, and replacement of damaged
public trees.

procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this article, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way located within the village and, in particular,
the use of the public ways and property, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by the presence of facilities in the public ways and
property, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased storm water run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this article. This article applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdictional boundaries of the village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this article may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this article.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities. In the event that a utility provider has entered into a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this article and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other articles. This article supersedes all articles or
parts of articles adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this article to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this article and may vary the standards, conditions
and requirements expressed in this article when the village so determines.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the village to
regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and
welfare.

§ 12-5-5 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Village
Engineer within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and
regulations, the Village Engineer shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Village Engineer is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this article and applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, the Village Engineer shall
issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be
the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village
Engineer, that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full
compliance with the requirements of this article.
   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this article for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications
and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the
village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The Village Engineer shall specify the portion of the
right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Village Engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either ten
days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or 25 days
after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this article.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
12-5-4 the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) above.
   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village;
provided, the holder has complied with all applicable village codes, ordinances
and regulations.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009)
§ 12-5-6 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this article on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this article prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners. The Village Engineer may waive the
mandatory attendance requirement for a pre-construction meeting.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009)
§ 12-5-7 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   Any deviation from the permit shall require approval of the Village Engineer
or designee prior to the work being performed. The Village Engineer may require
revised plans, drawings and specifications as necessary to allow for the proper
review and approval of the deviation.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009)
§ 12-5-8 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way not including utility easements, shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions
(A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred to as
“X”, “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section and shall meet with the approval
of the Village Manager.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or
not to renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A) of this section, or the requirements of divisions
(B), (C) and (D) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability
to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
division (A) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private
self-insurer” under the Worker’s Compensation Act, being 820 ILCS 305/1 et seq.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-” or better
and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009)
§ 12-5-9 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction, maintenance and/or
repair of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or
offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license,
or similar agreement; provided, however, that, the utility’s indemnity
obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands,
judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the
negligence, misconduct or breach of this article by the village, its officials,
officers, employees, agents or representatives.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009; Am. Ord. 2017-03-08, passed 3-20-2017)
§ 12-5-10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this article;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash or an irrevocable in a form
acceptable to the village in a form acceptable to the village. Any letter of
credit provided pursuant to this division (B) shall be provided on the
village’s form.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Engineer
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon ten days’ advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund;
provided that, the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the ten day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid or if any of the improvements have been or are likely to be, the subject
of liens or other claims by contractors, subcontractors or third parties;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee;
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund;
      (5)   Fails to satisfactorily complete or carry on the work of the
installation, construction and restoration of the permitted work in accordance
with its permit, the village’s rules and regulations and a schedule approved by
the village, or if no schedule is approved or even if no one is set out, in
accordance with the faster pace as deemed necessary by the village for the
installation of the improvement;
      (6)   Fails to provide a new letter of credit or amendment of the letter
of credit, containing equivalent terms, within 60 days of the actual expiration
of the original letter of credit; or
      (7)   If the sums remaining within the letter of credit are believed to
be insufficient.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation; provided
that, any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

30 days notice to the permittee of failure to cure the non-compliance, deem
them abandoned and property of the village. The permittee shall be liable in
all events to the village for all costs of removal.

located underground, unless not technically practicable.
      (2)   Whenever new telecommunications facilities will exhaust the
capacity of a right-of-way or utility easement to reasonably accommodate future
facilities, a permitee may be required to provide additional ducts, conduits,
manholes and other facilities for non-discriminatory access to future
permitees.
      (3)   No interference with the public ways. No facilities shall be placed
in any location if the Village Engineer determines that the proposed location
will require the relocation or displacement of any of the village’s facilities
or proposed village facilities or will otherwise interfere with use of the
right-of-way by the general public or the operation or maintenance of any of
the village’s facilities, proposed village facilities, or any other existing
facilities. The village may require any facilities causing such interference to
be moved, as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way. Underground telecommunications facilities shall be installed within an
existing underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within
such duct or conduit.
      (5)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (6)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.

structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   An applicant shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;

as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA- 10 gradation, as
designated by the Engineer.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last ten years, or resurfaced in the last seven
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be located in
the area established as clear zone for that particular section of the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided

trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall be issued by the Director of Public
Works and shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that
the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees as determined by the Director of Public Works will not be
tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and
for assessment of damages. The village will require compensation for trees
extensively damaged and for trees removed without authorization. The formula
developed by the International Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis
for determining the compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of
trees. The village may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming
or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The Director of
Public Works may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen
trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of
higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

maintenance or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this article; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise or permit.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to remove or relocate or alter any facilities located
within the rights-of-way of the village, as the village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety
emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify
the utility, if known, prior to removing or relocating or altering a facility
and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90
days. Following receipt of such notice, the village may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Village Engineer determines
that such removal will be in the best interest of the village. In the event
that the village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to
remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the village, the abandoning
utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any
portion of the facility by another utility or person. All vegetation screening
shall also be removed and the disturbed area properly restored if requested by
the Community Development Director.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009)

complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a

§ 12-5-21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this article must do so in writing to the Village
Engineer, Director of Public Works or the Community Development Director as
appropriate and as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Village Board shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Village Board may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Village Engineer, Director of Public Works or the
Community Development Director as appropriate may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the
purposes of this article.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Village
Engineer under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to
the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk
within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days
after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the
appeal.

as-built drawings depicting the actual locations and sizes of all improvements
within 30 days of the installation of the improvements.
(Ord. 2009-05-22, passed 5-4-2009)
§ 12-5-24 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

to approve or deny the application within 90 days, subject to the following: if
an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed
approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in writing of its
intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75 days after the
submission of a completed application. The permit shall be deemed approved on
the later of the ninetieth day after submission of the completed application,
or the tenth day after receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village.
Receipt of a deemed approved notice by the village shall not preclude the
village from denying the permit within the allowed time limit.
      (3)   New utility pole. Requests for the collocation of small wireless
facilities that include the installation of a new utility pole shall be
processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and either approved or denied within 120
days of submission of a completed application. A permit application shall be

   (I)   Resubmittal after denial. In the case of a permit denial, an applicant
may cure the deficiencies identified in the notice of denial and resubmit a
revised application once within 30 days after the notice of denial is sent
without payment of an additional application fee. The village shall have 30
days to approve or deny the resubmitted application or it is deemed approved,
if the applicant has notified the village of its intention to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which notification may be
submitted with the resubmitted application. Review of a resubmitted application
is limited to the deficiencies cited in the original notice of denial. This
division (I) does not apply if a revised application is not resubmitted within
30 days, or curing any deficiencies in the original application requires review
of a new location, new or different structure for collocation, new antennas, or
other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. In such
cases, a new application and application fee are required.
   (J)   Consolidated applications. Consolidated applications for small
wireless facilities for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities
shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the same type
of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. Each
consolidated application shall provide all the information required by this
article for each small wireless facility at each location. If such an
application includes incomplete information for one or more small wireless
facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless facilities that
do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are otherwise denied, the
village may remove such collocation requests from the application and treat
them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued for each collocation
approved in a consolidated application.
   (K)   Alternate locations. If an applicant is seeking to install a new
utility pole as part of its application, the village may propose that the small
wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless
support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation. The applicant
shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has the right to use
the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless the alternate location
imposes technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the
applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location based on the
foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence in the form
of a written certification, under oath, describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate location
from being utilized.

expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this code.
   (B)   A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any small wireless
facility that:
      (1)   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on

      (4)   Future undergrounding. The village may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the village shall
either:
         (a)   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         (b)   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   (F)   Collocation limits.
      (1)   Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      (2)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      (3)   For purposes of this division (F), the terms COMMUNICATIONS SPACE,
COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the meanings
given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

system of piping which receives its supply from the village waterworks system.
   (B)   Water which has once been used for any purpose whatsoever shall not be
returned to the building’s water supply system.
§ 13-2-25 SERVICE LINES AND CURB STOPS FOR MULTI-UNIT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS OR
INCUBATOR-TYPE BUILDINGS.
   No multi-unit commercial building or incubator-type building shall be
constructed with only one service line and one curb stop. An INCUBATOR-TYPE
BUILDING is defined as a commercial or industrial structure which is built with
the intention of dividing the usage among a number of tenants. Each unit within
a multi-unit commercial building or incubator-type building shall be served
with a separate meter and service line with a curb stop on each service. The
separate meter and service line shall be located outside of the building near
the supply line in a location where the meter can be easily read. A common
header main shall run for the entire length of the building on the outside of
the structure with individual service lines branching from the common header
main to each separate unit; provided, however, that, a single meter is allowed
to serve a multi-unit commercial building or incubator-type building where the
building is in single ownership or in unified control so that the owner of the
building or the managing agent of the building is responsible for paying the
unified water bill, and the property owner agrees to place a covenant on the
title of the property running to the benefit of the village whereby, upon the
sale of the property to more than one individual, firm or corporation, or upon
the partition of the property into more than one parcel, separately needed
water services in accordance with the provisions of this chapter will be
installed.
§ 13-2-26 SEPARATE BUILDING SEWER FOR EACH BUILDING REQUIRED; EXCEPTION.
   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except that, where one stands at the rear of another on an interior
lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear
building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
§ 13-2-27 WHEN OLD BUILDING SEWERS MAY BE USED.
   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when
they are found by the Village Engineer to meet all requirements of this code.
§ 13-2-28 PROHIBITION OF CONNECTION OF SURFACE RUNOFF OR GROUND WATER TO A
SEWER.
   No person shall make connection of roof down-spouts, exterior foundation
drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or ground water to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
§ 13-2-29 SIZE, SLOPE, MATERIALS, JOINTS AND THE LIKE OF BUILDING SEWERS.
   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer,
and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, joining, testing
and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of the
Building Code and Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and regulations of
the village. In no event shall the diameter of the pipe be less than six
inches. The slope of such six inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch
per foot. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the
Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois,
published by the Standard Specification Committee of the Illinois Society of
Professional Engineers and other similar organizations, third edition, shall
apply.
§ 13-2-30 DEPTH, GRADE AND ALIGNMENT OF SEWER.
   (A)   No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of
any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be
sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at
uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in
direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is not four feet above the top of the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a means which is
approved by the Village Engineer and discharged by the building sewer.
§ 13-2-31 CONNECTION OF BUILDING SEWER SERVICE TO SEWER MAIN.
   (A)   The building sewer shall generally enter the sewer main or lateral by
way of an existing “Y” or tee. In the event of absence of the “Y” or tee, the
connection to the sewer main or lateral shall be made by the following methods:
      (1)   Installation of a manhole;
      (2)   Circular saw cut of sewer main by proper tools and proper
installation of hub “Y” saddle or hub tee saddle in accordance with
manufacturer’s recommended instructions; and
      (3)   Use of pipe cutter to neatly and accurately cut out the desired
length of pipe for inserting a “Y” or tee fitting. Use stainless steel shear
rings and band seal couplings for connecting sewer pipes together.
   (B)   Indiscriminate breaking of the sewer main pipe for break-in connection
is expressly prohibited. The invert of the building sewer at the point of
connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the
public sewer.
§ 13-2-32 USE OF WATER PRESSURE EJECTORS, PUMPS AND THE LIKE TO DISCHARGE
SEWAGE.
   Water pressure ejectors, siphons or pumps of any nature shall not be
installed for discharging any sewage or waste, unless adequately protected
against back-siphonage, without the permission of the Village Engineer, and
such permission shall be revocable at will.
§ 13-2-33 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS REQUIRED.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or permit to be
deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the
village or in any area under the jurisdiction of the village any human or
animal excretion, garbage or other unsanitary waste.    
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to discharge to any storm sewer, natural
watercourse within the village, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the
village, any sewage, industrial waste or other polluted waters, except where
suitable treatment has been provided and permitted by the village.    
   (C)   Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or
maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility
intended or used for the disposal of sewage.
   (D)   The owner of any house, building or property used for human occupancy,
employment, recreation or other purpose situated within the village and
abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located or
may in the future be located any public sanitary sewer of the village, is
hereby required at his or her expense to install suitable toilet facilities
therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer
as required herein, within 90 days after date of written notice to do so is
served upon him or her by the village; provided that, such public sewer is
within 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the property line.

§ 13-2-34 PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   (A)   Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of
§
13-2-33(D), the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal
system complying with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Before the village will approve a new private sewage disposal system,
the owner shall provide documentation that demonstrates the inability to
connect to a public sanitary sewer and that connection to a public sanitary
sewer will cause hardship to the owner.
   (C)   Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal
system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit signed by the Director of
Public Works. The application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished
by the village, which the applicant shall supplement by any plans,
specifications and other information as are reasonably deemed necessary by the
Director of Public Works.
   (D)   A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not become
effective until the installation is completed and approved by the Village
Engineer. The Village Engineer shall be allowed to inspect the work at any
stage of construction and the applicant for the permit shall notify the Village
Engineer when the work is ready for final inspection, and before any
underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within a
reasonable time by the Village Engineer after receipt of such notice.
   (E)   The type, capacities, location and layout of a private sewage disposal
system shall comply with all recommendations of the State Private Sewage
Disposal Licensing Act (225 ILCS 225/1); the Private Sewage Disposal Code
promulgated thereunder, and all regulations of the State Environmental
Protection Agency. No permit shall be issued for any private disposal system
employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the lot is
less than 43,560 square feet (4,046 square meters). No septic tank or cesspool
shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
   (F)   At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served
by a private sewage disposal system, as provided in §
13-2-33(D), a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance
with this Article, and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private sewage
disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable material.   
   (G)   The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal
facilities in a sanitary manner at all times and at no expense to the village.
   (H)   No statement contained in this Article shall be construed to supersede
more stringent requirements that may be imposed by the DuPage County Health
Department.
   (I)   When a public sewer becomes available, the building sewer shall be
connected to the public sewer within 60 days of written notice from the Village
Engineer and the private sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of bio-solids
and filled with clean bank-run gravel or dirt.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-2-35 SEWER USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in §
13-6-2, and which in the judgment of the Village Engineer may have a
deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Engineer may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of §
13-19-1 through
13-19-4. If the Village Engineer permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Village Engineer, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (E)   Where preliminary treatment of flow-equalizing facilities is provided,
such facilities shall be continuously maintained in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (F)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Village Engineer, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand or other harmful ingredients; except that, such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Village Engineer, and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the Village Engineer, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole when required shall be accessibly and safely located, and
shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Village Engineer.
The manhole and equipment shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
      (1)   Each sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus flume unless a
weir or similar device is approved by the POTW with a recording and totalizing
register for measurement of the liquid quantity; or, at the discretion of the
village, the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as the
liquid quantity where it is substantiated to the village that the metered water
supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable
adjustment agreed to by the POTW is made in the metered water supply to
determine the liquid quantity.
   (E)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analysis of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this Article and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type and frequency of
laboratory analysis to be performed by the owner shall be stipulated by the
village, but no less than twice per year the industry must supply a complete
analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharged to assure that
compliance with the federal, state and local standards are being met. The owner
shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analysis to the Village
Engineer at such times and in such manner as he or she prescribes. The owner
shall bear the expense of all measurements, analysis and reporting required by
the village. At such time as deemed necessary, the village reserves the right
to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   (F)   All measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this Article shall be determined in
accordance with that publication entitled Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater, Fifteenth Edition, published by the American Public
Health Association, as amended from time to time, and shall be determined at
the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. The particular analysis involved will determine
whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
   (G)   No statement contained herein shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the village and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the village for treatment, subject to payment therefore, in accordance with §
13-19-1 through 13-19-4, by the industrial concern.   
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-2-36 FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS.
   All food service establishments are required to install a grease interceptor
and obtain all required permits (e.g. village, county, etc.) for the
installation. The user is required to routinely clean and properly maintain the
grease interceptor so that the discharge to the POTW is in compliance with §
13-6-5(A). All permits and cleaning and maintenance records shall be kept on-
site for a minimum of three years. Upon request, the village shall be allowed
access to inspect the FSE grease interceptor.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-2-37 SEWER LINE MAINTENANCE/ REPLACEMENT.
   (A)   The property owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of
the private sewer line from their structure to the main sewer or public sewer
including the connection into the main/public sewer.   
   (B)   In the event the property owner finds it necessary to excavate the
private sewer line for maintenance or replacement, such excavation shall be the
property owner’s responsibility.
   (C)   In those instances when property owners have had to excavate and as a
result the sidewalk, curb and street have been dug out or damaged, the property
owner will be responsible for the restoration of the street (surface and sub-
surface) curb and sidewalk.
   (D)   In those instances where division (C) is involved, it is recommended
tunneling under the curb and sidewalk whenever practical. Sidewalk and curb
must be cut when removal is required.
   (E)   All work, as it is related to the replacement and/or repair of the
private sewer line, shall be in conformance with the village standard
construction specifications and will be inspected by a duly authorized agent of
the village during the repair and replacement.
   (F)   The village will participate in the repair or replacement of a private
sanitary sewer service line located under the paved roadway within the
village’s right-of-way subject to the following:
      (1)   The sanitary sewer service line has been televised by the property
owner and based on the evidence provided to the village, to include video and
evidence of location of the potential issue, the Village Engineer or Public
Works Director have determined the sewer service line under the paved roadway
presents the potential to damage the village’s paved roadway or the village’s
sewer main if uncorrected; and
      (2)   The only method of repair or replacement of the sanitary sewer
service line requires excavation of the village’s paved roadway.
      (3)   The village will reimburse the property owner 50% of the costs
toward the repair or replacement of the private sanitary sewer line under the
village paved roadway and pavement repair in an amount not to exceed $10,000.
The applicant will be responsible for all additional costs associated with the
sanitary sewer service line repair or replacement in excess of these amounts.
      (4)   The applicant will indemnify, hold and release the village from any
and all liability arising from the repair of the sanitary sewer service line by
the village.

   All consumers, users or properties in the village shall pay such rates for
the use and service of the waterworks and sewerage system in such manner and
amounts as may be prescribed by ordinance from time to time by the Board of
Trustees.
(Ord. 2000-08-63, passed 8-7-2000)
§ 13-3-13 RATES.
   (A)   There are hereby established rates or charges for the use of and for
the service supplied by the combined waterworks and sewerage system of the
village based upon the amount of water consumed, as shown by the water meters,
as set forth in this article.
   (B)   For each residential single-family, commercial or industrial user of
the combined waterworks and sewerage system within the corporate limits, the
charge for water and sewer service shall be as follows: The charge shall be
$14.69 per each 1,000 gallons or a fraction thereof.
   (C)   For each residential single-family and multi-family, commercial, or
industrial user of water service only, within the corporate limits, the charge
for water service only shall be as follows: For each 1,000 gallons, the charge
shall be $9.54 per each 1,000 gallons or fraction thereof.
   (D)   For each residential single-family and multi-family, commercial or
industrial user of the sewer service only, within the corporate limits, the
charge for sewer service only shall be as follows: For each 1,000 gallons, the
charge shall be $5.15 for each 1,000 gallons or fraction thereof.
   (E)   The payment of such rate for all metered users shall cover all
reasonable usage, but not any other usage which the Mayor and Board of Trustees
determines to be unreasonable. In cases where the character of sewage from an
industrial plant, building or premises shall be such as to impose a burden upon
the sewage treatment plant system, in addition to the burden imposed by the
average sewage entering into the sewerage system of the village, or in cases
where a private water supply is used and returned to the sewerage system of the
village, then the Mayor and Board of Trustees reserve the right to enter into

   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly
owned treatment works (POTW) for the Village of Carol Stream, hereafter
referred to interchangeably as the village. This chapter provides for the use
of public and private sewers and drains, private sewage disposal, and
authorizes the installation and continuing of connections into the sewage works
of the village upon certain conditions, including permission thereof; providing
for the installation and maintenance of such connections and enforcements
thereto; regulating the use of municipal and private sewers and drains;
individual wastewater disposal, the installation, connection and disconnection
of building sewers, the discharge of water and waste in the public sewer
system; and providing for penalties for violation thereof; and providing for
termination of permits issued by the village pursuant to the provisions hereof.
   (B)   This chapter enables the village to comply with all applicable state
and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251
et seq.) and General Pretreatment Regulations of 40 CFR Part 403. Additional
objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or
otherwise be incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works;
      (3)   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by air, wastewater
and bio-solids in the course of their employment and the general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and bio-
solids from the POTW;
      (5)   To enable the village to comply with its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, bio-solids use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject;
      (6)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW; and
      (7)   To regulate private wastewater disposal systems.
   (C)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW and provides for the
enforcement of general requirements for users. The chapter authorizes the
issuance of wastewater connection and discharge permits; provides for
monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative
review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the programs
established herein. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge
permits that do not allow the discharge of defined process waste streams but
continue to allow the discharge of domestic or sanitary wastewater.

§ 13-6-3 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   These pretreatment requirements shall apply to all non-residential users
subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, promulgated by the
USEPA in accordance with Section 307(b) and (c) of the Act, currently
discharging or scheduled to discharge to the village. The National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, found in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405 –
471 are hereby incorporated into this chapter.
   Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge
from the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the
standard. Compliance with National Categorical Pretreatment Standards is
mandatory.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with divisions (B) and (F) of this section and 40 CFR 403.6(c)
unless specifically restricted by the categorical pretreatment standard. These
equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements
are deemed pretreatment standards. Users shall be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived. An alternative pretreatment
limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical
detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants.
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production, the village may convert
the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to individual users see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(2)).
   (C)   The village calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall
calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the
user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be
based not upon the designed production capacity, but rather upon a reasonable
measure of the user's actual long-term daily production during a representative
year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected
production.
   (D)   The village calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall
calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average
daily flow rate of the user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily
flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-
term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the
representative year.
   (E)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Pretreatment
Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the Combined Waste Stream
Formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters
to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance
of an alternative limit.
   (F)   A user may request a variance from categorical pretreatment standards
from USEPA based on fundamentally different factors. The request must comply
with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
   (G)   A user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   (H)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the village convert the
limits to equivalent mass limits (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(4)). The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Pretreatment Coordinator. The village may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the user meets all the conditions set forth in divisions (H)(1)(a) through
(e) of this section.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its
individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for
equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   A user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent Flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division (H)(1)
(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
Pretreatment Coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division (H)(1)(a) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Pretreatment
Coordinator:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to §
13-6-2(B). The user must be in compliance with §
13-17-2 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (I)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Pretreatment
Coordinator.
   (J)   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
   (K)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations.
   (L)   Any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator with two business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Pretreatment
Coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.
   (M)   All users that are subject to National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards are required to file reports as required in this chapter, signed by
an authorized representative per §§
13-10-2 and 13-10-3. These reports shall include all information that the
village deems necessary to make compliance determinations.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-6-4 STATE LIMITS.
   (A)   All users are subject to state standards and requirements as defined
in 35 Ill Adm. Code (IAC) 307. Specifically, the standard for discharge of
mercury is as follows:
      (1)   Mercury (35 IAC 307.1102)
         (a)   Except as provided below, no person shall cause or allow the
concentration of mercury in any discharge to a publicly owned or publicly
regulated sewer system to exceed the following level, subject to the averaging
rule contained in 35 IAC 304.104(a):
 
CONSTITUENT STORET NUMBER CONCENTRATION (mg/1)
Mercury     71900         0.0005
 
         (b)   It shall be an exception to division (A)(1)(a) if the discharge
is to a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which is required to
meet a limitation less stringent than the 0.0005 mg/l mercury concentration in
which case the discharge limitation shall be the same as that applicable to the
publicly owned or regulated sewer system to which it discharges.
         (c)   It shall be an exception to division (A)(1)(a) if all the
following conditions are met:
            1.   The discharger does not use mercury; or, the discharger uses
mercury and this use cannot be eliminated; or, the discharger uses mercury only
in chemical analysis or in laboratory or other equipment and takes reasonable
care to avoid contamination of wastewater; and,
            2.   The discharge mercury concentration is less than 0.003 mg/l,
as determined by application of the averaging rules of 35 IAC 304.104(a); and,
            3.   The discharger is providing the best degree of treatment
consistent with technological feasibility, economic reasonableness and sound
engineering judgment. This may include no treatment for mercury; and,
            4.   The discharger has an inspection and maintenance program
likely to reduce or to prevent an increase in the level of mercury discharges.
         (d)   The discharge of wastes from medicinal or therapeutic use of
mercury, exclusive of laboratory use, shall be exempt from the limitations of
division (A)(1)(a) if all the following conditions are met:
            1.   The total discharge is less than 227 g (one-half pound) as
mercury (Hg) in any year;
            2.   This discharge is to a public sewer system; and
            3.   The discharge does not, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, cause the effluent from the sewer system or treatment plant to exceed
0.0005 mg/l of mercury.
         (e)   No person shall cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a
publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which, alone or in
combination with other sources, causes a violation by the sewer treatment plant
discharge of the Water Quality Standard of 35 IAC 302 for mercury applicable in
the receiving stream.
         (f)   For purposes of permit issuance, the IEPA may consider
application of the exception of division (A)(1)(b) or (c) of this section to
determine compliance with this section. The IEPA may impose permit conditions
necessary or required to assure continued application of the exception. When
division (A)(1)(b) or (c) of this section applies, the IEPA may impose an
effluent limitation in the permit which allows the discharge of a concentration
of mercury greater than 0.0005 mg/l but not more than 0.003 mg/l.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-6-5 LOCAL LIMITS.
   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference.
   (A)   Non-toxic pollutants.

      (1)   The village reserves the right to apply the FSE Local Limit as
appropriate above at an end-of-pipe discharge location that connects to the
public sewer system in the event that a unique sampling location in the end
compartment of a grease interceptor (GI) is not available or there is no
external GI.
      (2)   The village also reserves the right to apply the FSE Local Limit to
the wastewater in the next sanitary sewer manhole downstream of the facility in
the event that there is neither a GI sampling location nor a sampling manhole
at the site.
   (B)   Toxic pollutants. No user shall discharge any wastewater containing
concentrations greater than the daily maximum local limits as set forth below
into any sewers that connect either directly or indirectly to the POTW.

   (C)   The village will apply the local limits found in divisions (A) and (B)
of this section normally at the end-of-pipe point where the non-residential
waste is discharged to the municipal sewer system.
   (D)   The village reserves the right to establish requirements, by ordinance
or in a wastewater discharge permit or general permit, the quantities and rates
of discharge from any user.   
   (E)   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in a
wastewater discharge permit, mass limitations rather than concentration
limitations on discharges particularly if users are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (F)   The village reserves the right to set specific limits for those
pollutants not identified in divisions (A) or (B) of this section on a case by
case basis for impacts caused to the POTW including but not limited to
interference, potential problems, pass through and prevention of beneficial
bio-solids re-use. Those limits shall be set forth in a wastewater discharge
permit per Article 9.
      (1)   Local limits for additional pollutants not identified in divisions
(A) or (B) of this section will be noticed to the permit holder a minimum of 30
days prior to the effective date of the wastewater discharge permit. In the
event that the village receives written comment on said limit during the
comment period, the limit will take effect within 60 days of the public notice
date to allow review and comment by the village.
   (G)   The village may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
local limits and the requirements of §
13-6-2.
   (H)   Any user whose discharge may be pretreated and/or treated more
effectively by the village and discharges to the village's POTW that cause the
village to alter its method of wastewater treatment or bio-solids disposal to a
more costly method shall be assessed the differential cost between the more
costly method of treatment and the less costly method of treatment. Such costs
shall only be assessed upon approval of the Village Board.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-6-6 RIGHT OF REVISION.
   (A)   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits or general permits, more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter. The specific limitations on discharge listed in §
13-6-5 are derived from the maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL)
calculation. The MAILs are allocated only to those IUs, at the village's
discretion, that contribute the regulated pollutant and all remaining IUs are
held to either the background concentration or slightly higher than background
but lower than the specific discharge limit. In no case shall the total of all
allocations exceed the MAIL.
   (B)   The village will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks
pollutant loading for each pollutant for new industries or increase with
existing industries. The village will recalculate the maximum concentrations

§ 13-6-7 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Sampling manhole applicability.
      (1)   All non-residential users are required to install a sampling
manhole for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with
the plans and specifications approved by the village and §
13-2-35(D).
         (a)   When required by the village, a SIU or NSRU, that does not have
a unique sampling chamber at end-of-pipe, shall install a monitoring manhole or
sampling chamber for use as the regulation location of local limits in the
building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
village.
         (b)   When required by the village, a categorical industrial user
shall install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use as the
regulation location of the categorically regulated discharge in the building
sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village. This
sampling chamber may be required to be installed within the building and may be
in addition to an end-of-pipe manhole.
      (2)   The village reserves the right to apply said local limits in §
13-6-5(A) and (B) at an end-of process discharge location that connects to the
POTW sewer system in the event that:
         (a)   A unique sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is not available;
         (b)   A more representative sample can be taken of a process batch
discharge even though an end-of-pipe manhole exists;
         (c)   A more representative sample can be taken at the end-of-process
location than the end-of-pipe location as a result of impacts from dilute
wastestreams;
         (d)   An end-of process location is used because the IU is unable to
provide adequate flow documentation to use a combined wastestream formula.
      (2)   In the event that a suitable sampling manhole does not exist as per
§
13-6-7 and no end-of-process discharge sampling location exists, the "sampling
facility" shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.    
   (B)   Wastewater monitoring and/or flow measurement facility operation and
maintenance.
      (1)   Such facilities will be installed and maintained at all times at
the user's expense. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that the sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge. Installation will be consistent
with the requirements of §
13-2-35(D).
      (2)   The manhole or chamber located on a building sewer discharge
located in dedicated easements shall be easily accessible to representatives of
the village 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
      (3)   The manhole or chamber at a discharge location within the building
shall be accessible to representatives of the village during normal user
operating hours.
      (4)   Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if it
is substantiated to the village that the metered water supply and wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
village is made in the metered water supply to determine wastewater flow which
is documented through the use of sub-meters and/or production records. In the
event that the wastewater flow cannot be substantiated at any regulated
location, the user will be required to install flow monitoring consistent with
§
13-2-35(D).
      (5)   The sampling chamber, flow metering device, sampling equipment and
documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analysis of
samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection by the village.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-6-8 MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. At minimum, all significant industrial users (SIU)
including categorical industrial users (CIU) as well as non-significant
regulated users (NSRU) are required to sample based on the village monitoring
frequency as stated in the wastewater discharge permit. Other users are
required to sample upon the request of the village. The users shall pay the
costs of sampling of its discharge and the costs of analyses of its samples,
whether or not the sampling and analyses are done by the user or by the POTW.
   (B)   Frequency.
      (1)   All significant industrial users (SIU) including categorical
industrial users (CIU) with wastewater discharge permits must sample their
effluent consistent with the permit requirements and report the results to the
POTW at least twice yearly. The village may specify more frequent reporting,
quarterly or monthly, dependent of the frequency for those parameters specified
in the user's permit and the village monitoring frequency defined in the
Village Enforcement Response Plan. The SIU may have the village conduct routine
monitoring using an independent laboratory. Sampling visits of this type will
normally be unannounced.
      (2)   Any non-significant regulated users (NSRU) with an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit shall sample their effluent and report the
results to the POTW consistent with the requirements of the wastewater
discharge permit and the village monitoring frequency.
      (3)   The village shall have the right to perform its own sampling at any
time at any location. village data will be used for all surcharge evaluations.
      (4)   The village may initiate sampling and analyses at a greater
frequency as a result of a violation of any discharge permit limit, including
cases where hot spot maintenance issues or blockage to the sanitary sewer
system has occurred.
      (5)   The Pretreatment Coordinator will define sampling and analyses for
any batch discharges as appropriate.
      (6)   Cost of village sampling and analyses for any monitoring will be
invoiced to the applicable user.
   (C)   Sample collection.
      (1)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the entire sampling and reporting period as defined
in the wastewater discharge permit.
      (2)   Except as indicated in divisions (C)(3) and (C)(5) of this section,
the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite
collection techniques.
      (3)   In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling at
minimum collecting samples every 15 minutes during a 24-hour workday; or a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide
a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. A proportional number
of samples shall be collected for wastewater discharges less than 24 hours.
      (4)   Single grab samples may be required in the event of an infrequent
batch discharge or to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      (5)   Samples for fats, oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
hexavalent chromium, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be
obtained using the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Multiple
grab samples that are individually preserved as specified in 40 CFR 136 and
appropriate USEPA guidance that are collected during a 24-hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis, as follows:
         (a)   For cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, and sulfides:
multiple grab samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
         (b)   For volatile organics and oil and grease: multiple grab samples
may only be composited in the laboratory.
      (6)   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the village, as appropriate.

§ 13-6-9 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or
any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the Pretreatment Coordinator or other parties approved by USEPA.

   Each user that discharges non-residential source waste shall provide
wastewater treatment and best management practices as necessary to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Article 6 of this
chapter within the time limitations specified by USEPA, the state, or the
Pretreatment Coordinator, whichever is more stringent.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-7-2 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (A)   Any pretreatment facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Pretreatment Coordinator for review, and must be approved by the Pretreatment
Coordinator before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the village under the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements.
Users shall obtain all necessary construction-operating permits from the IEPA
prior to the village connection and/or discharge permit(s) being issued. IEPA
will make the determination of actual permitting requirements based on changes
in the wastewater volume or characteristics generated at the user site. The
village will track and parallel this IEPA permitting process. No sources of
non-residential wastewater will be allowed to discharge to village POTW until
all permitting requirements have been satisfied. Such pretreatment facilities
shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater
operator.    
   (C)   Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported and must be approved by the village and IEPA prior
to the user's initiation of the changes. Users shall obtain all additional
construction-operating permits from IEPA and the village for the changes prior
to discharge.

§ 13-7-3 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   At minimum, the village may require the additional pretreatment measures
defined below. The village reserves the right to make unannounced inspections
of any additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours whether
the user has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
or not.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Pretreatment Coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require any person or user
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. The village may issue an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-7-4 SPILL PREVENTION CONTAINMENT AND COUNTERMEASURES/ SLUG CONTROL PLAN.
   (A)   All permitted non-residential users are required to develop, implement
and maintain best management practices in the form of a Spill Prevention
Containment and Countermeasures/Slug Control Plan hereafter referred to as
Spill Plan. The village may require other non-residential users to develop a
Spill Plan, should that user have:
      (1)   Chemicals (raw materials, chemical intermediates, wastes to be
recycled, final products, or utility chemicals) that total or exceed 250
gallons at or on its site;   
      (2)   Prohibited discharge materials as defined in §
13-6-2 at or on its site;
      (3)   Hazardous waste as defined in §
13-10-9 at or on its site; or
      (4)   Been defined by the Pretreatment Coordinator to have a need to
control slug discharges.
      (5)   All non-residential users that meet the above criteria are required
to develop and implement a Spill Plan regardless whether that user is regulated
by a wastewater discharge permit or not.
   (B)   The Spill Plan which is required to be submitted to the village if the
user's discharge is regulated shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Specifics of Spill Plan:
         (a)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
         (b)   Description of stored chemicals, including quantity of chemicals
and type and number of storage containers;
         (c)   Site diagram showing location of all tanks holding greater than
or equal to 250 gallons or areas containing eight drums or more of raw
materials, prohibited wastes, wastes to be recycled, hazardous wastes or final
product. Identification and location of all liquid materials is mandatory;
         (d)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response. Building containment structures or production equipment changes are
considered procedures to prevent adverse spills. If containment structures are
connected to the sanitary sewer, a valve normally left in a closed position is
required;
         (e)   Location of notice/signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event
of a spill, accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug discharge or a
bypass of any part of a pretreatment system; and
         (f)   Emergency telephone number (24-hour) off-site and backup
telephone number. If the Spill Plan has been submitted, any change in the
telephone numbers should be submitted within five working days when revised.
      (2)   Notification procedure. The Spill Prevention Containment and
Countermeasures/Slug Control Plan shall contain procedures for immediately
notifying the Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental or slug discharge, as
required by §
13-10-7;
      (3)   Documentation. The Spill Prevention Containment and
Countermeasures/Slug Control Plan shall contain a sample of the documentation
maintained at the site that:
         (a)   Ensures that all employees who are in a position to cause,
discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedures; and
         (b)   Such logs to verify inspection and maintenance procedures to
prevent adverse impacts and confirm that said procedures are being performed on
a regular basis. At minimum, logs are required to verify valves in containment
structures, if present, are closed.
   (C)   Review of such plans and operating procedures by the village shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility or Spill
Plan as necessary to meet all requirements of this chapter. Review by the
village does not constitute an approval of a spill plan and the village and its
designee(s) are not to be construed as responsible for the actions of the user
and any impacts the user may cause as a result of a spill or slug load.
   (D)   At least once every two years the Pretreatment Coordinator shall
evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a revision to its Spill
Plan. The Pretreatment Coordinator may require any user to submit at a
frequency less than two years such Spill Plan or require modification of an
existing Spill Plan based on changes that have occurred at the site or in
response to an incident that had the potential to impact the POTW. In alternate
years, the Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether each non-significant
regulated user is required to file a revision to its Spill Plan based on
changes that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident that had
the potential to impact the POTW.

load to the POTW;
      (6)   Non-residential users that have devices installed to remove oils,
grease and sand;
      (7)   Non-residential users required to eliminate or control specified
pollutants from their wastestream through the development and implementation of
a Best Management Practice (BMP) Plan.
   (D)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
subject the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in Articles
14 through 16 of this chapter. Obtaining an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with
all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other

   (C)   General application requirement. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
require all users that are required to obtain a general wastewater discharge
permit to submit an application on a form provided by the village which is
specific to the category regulated by the general wastewater discharge permit.
The form may require but is not limited to contact information, production
processes, the types of wastes generated, and the location for monitoring all
wastes if regulated by the general permit. Where the standard will require
compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall
submit documentation as required by the Pretreatment Coordinator.   
   (D)   Categorical monitoring waivers.
      (1)   Authority. Pursuant to 40 CFR Part 403.12(e)(2)(v) and (vi), the
village may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user.
This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are derived
from mass standards or production based standards. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
         (c)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as

§ 13-10-1 PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USERS.
   Should the village find that a non-residential user does not meet
pretreatment standards and requirements applicable to its discharge, causes or
contributes to potential problems at the POTW, or when analysis of waste or
observation of the effect of such wastes on the POTW indicate that said wastes
cannot be treated satisfactorily at such works, or that said wastes are
injurious to the POTW, or to the treatment processes, or pollute the natural
waters within the village, its service areas or the Waters of the State of
Illinois additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required by the village to
meet pretreatment standards and requirements. Such facilities as the village
may deem necessary for pretreatment of the wastes shall be furnished by and at
the expense of the user as a condition of the discharge of said wastes into the
POTW or to any natural water within the village service area.
   (A)   Pretreatment review. The Pretreatment Coordinator will require the
user to initiate a pretreatment review through a telephone call, letter or
certified letter to the authorized representative of the user.
   (B)   Pretreatment initiation meeting. A pretreatment initiation meeting
will be held between the Pretreatment Coordinator and the user to discuss the
problem and the solution to said problem. If it is determined that changes in
operation and maintenance, plant modifications, and/or the installation of
pretreatment equipment must occur in order to resolve noncompliance, a schedule
shall be established with events and completion deadlines agreeable to both
parties to resolve the noncompliance. If appropriate, a compliance agreement
defining the agreed upon schedule will be sent from the village to the user
shortly after the meeting. If a schedule for compliance acceptable to the
Pretreatment Coordinator cannot be established, the matter will be referred for
further enforcement action consistent with the provisions of Article 14 as
appropriate.
   (C)   Progress reports. Progress reports will be filed by the user on a
schedule agreed to by the Pretreatment Coordinator concerning the completion of
major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment
standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation). The user shall identify whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.
   (D)   Final report. A final report will be filed with the Pretreatment
Coordinator by the user normally required within 90 calendar days from the end
of the schedule deadline to verify the success or failure or the schedule
objective chosen by the user. The final report will if appropriate identify the
steps being taken by the user to resolve noncompliance.

§ 13-10-2 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL
USERS.
   In the event that either the village, EPA or a user determines that the user
is regulated as a categorical industrial user by standards and requirements
promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with Section 307 (b) and (c) of the Act,
the following reports are required to be filed by the user with both the
village and USEPA.
   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports. Within either 180 calendar days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final
administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4),
whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging
to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Pretreatment
Coordinator a report which contains the information listed below. At least 90
calendar days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and
sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation
of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the Pretreatment
Coordinator a report which contains the information listed below. A new source
shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. Users described
above shall submit the information set forth below.
      (1)   Identifying information. The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.
      (2)   Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits
held by or for the facility.

average rate of production, (including each product produced by type, amount,
processes, and rate of production), and standard industrial classifications of
the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a
schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from
the regulated processes.
      (4)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily
and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the Combined Waste
Stream Formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      (5)   Measurements of pollutants.
         (a)   The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process and any new categorically regulated
processes for existing sources;
         (b)   The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the
standard or by the Pretreatment Coordinator, of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-
term average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the standard
requires a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the
user shall submit documentation as required by the Pretreatment Coordinator or
the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard;
         (c)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. A
minimum of four grab samples are required for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds;
         (d)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow the use of the Combined Wastestream Formula
of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards.
Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data
shall be submitted to the control authority;
         (e)   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out
in §
13-6-8 and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in §
13-6-9;
         (f)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures; and
         (g)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the village.
      (6)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative of the user (as defined in §
13-5-6), and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required for the user to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in division (B) of
this section.
      (8)   Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with §
13-8-6.
   (B)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by division (A)(7) of this section.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine calendar months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Pretreatment
Coordinator no later than 14 calendar days following each date in the schedule
and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule;
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine calendar months elapse between
such progress reports to the Pretreatment Coordinator; and
      (5)   All compliance schedule progress reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with §
13-8-6.   
   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 calendar days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Pretreatment Coordinator a report containing the information described in
division (A) of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c) and §
13-6-3, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of

determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator but in no case less than twice per
year (on dates specified by the village) submit a report to the village with a
description of the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
      (2)   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge and comply with the
requirements of §§
13-6-8 and
13-6-9.
      (3)   All sampling and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu
of significant industrial user. In such cases, the village will issue an
attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the village will
perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum.
      (4)   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the Pretreatment Coordinator or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      (5)   Where the village itself collects all the information required for
the report, the significant non-categorical industrial user will not be
required to submit the report.
   (B)   Categorical industrial users.
      (1)   All industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
(categorical industrial users) shall, at a frequency determined by the
Pretreatment Coordinator but in no case less than twice per year on dates
specified by the village (normally in July and January), submit a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the discretion of the village
and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the village may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are to be submitted. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with §
13-8-6.
      (2)   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge and comply with the
requirements of §§
13-6-8 and
13-6-9.
      (3)   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu
of categorical industrial user. In such cases, the village will issue an
attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the village will
perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum.
      (4)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Pretreatment
Coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in §§
13-6-8 and
13-6-9, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
      (5)   Where the village has imposed mass limitations on users as provided
for by 40 CFR Part 403.6(c), the report required by division (B)(1) of this
section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the pretreatment
standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
      (6)   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the village in accordance with the procedures in §
13-6-3(F), the report required by division (B)(1) of this section shall contain
a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), the report required by division (B)(1) of this section shall
include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      (7)   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the Pretreatment Coordinator or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      (8)   Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for pollutants found to be not
present and revision of the user's permit by the Pretreatment Coordinator, the
user must certify on each periodic report with the statement in §
13-8-6, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due
to activities of the user with the following statement:
   "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______(specify
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard part(s)), I certify that,
to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level
of the _________(list the categorically regulated pollutant(s)) in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic report."
      (9)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of division
(B)(1) of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed
by the Pretreatment Coordinator, and notify the Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (C)   Non-significant categorical users.
      (1)   Non-significant categorical industrial users as defined in §
13-5-6 shall, at a frequency determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator but no
less frequently than annually (on dates specified by the village) submit a
report which contains the certification statement contained in division (C)(2)
of this section.
      (2)   Certification statement.
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR ___, I
certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period
from        ,         to             ,                  (months, days, year):

   b)   The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements during this reporting period; and
   c)   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
   This compliance certification is based on the following information:
                                                                                                                                       "
   The report is required to be signed by an authorized representative of the
user.
   (D)   Other non-significant regulated users.
      (1)   Categorical zero process dischargers, non-categorical zero process
dischargers, batch dischargers, food service establishments and any firms
regulated by individual or general permit requirements including but not
limited to best management practices shall, at a frequency determined by the
Pretreatment Coordinator, submit a periodic report at a frequency defined in
their wastewater discharge permit.
      (2)   The reports may require sampling and analyses or some other measure

shift, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants including changes
to the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has
submitted initial notification under §
13-10-9, introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring waiver had been
obtained, the addition of a new process regardless of waste discharge or lack
of discharge, shutdown of a process, or addition or deletion of a product.
   (D)   Significant industrial users and categorical industrial users are
required to notify the Pretreatment Coordinator immediately of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-10-7 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   Initial notification. In the case of any discharge, including, but not
limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic
nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone (within
15 minutes), and notify the Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident. If this
notification cannot be made to the POTW staff during routine business hours,
the user shall notify the Village Police Department. This notification shall
include the name of the caller, location of the discharge, physical state of
discharge, chemical composition, concentration and volume, if known, and date
and time of discharge as well as duration of the discharge, and corrective
actions taken by the user. The notification shall include what federal, state
and local entities have also been notified by the user.    
   (B)   The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is

includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.    
   (C)   Written notification. Within 15 calendar days following such
discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the Pretreatment Coordinator,
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and
the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
   (D)   Such notifications shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (E)   A notice/sign shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees in English and the language of
common use whom to call in the event of a discharge described in division (A)
of this section. Employers shall ensure through documentation that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.

§ 13-10-8 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator within 30
calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required
to resample if the Pretreatment Coordinator monitors at the user's facility at
least once a month, or if the Pretreatment Coordinator samples between the
user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this
sampling. If the village performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
user, the village will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it
notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
sampling and analysis.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-10-9 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12 (p) any user who commences the discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the USEPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the
user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 calendar days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under §
13-10-6. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
13-10-2(A) and (B), and 13-10-3(B).
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator, the USEPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 90 calendar days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree that the user will not cause
potential problems or interference at the POTW, and will comply with the
prohibited discharge standards in §
13-6-2 and local limits in §
13-6-5.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 13-10-10 REPORT SUBMITTAL DUE DATES.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern. In order to meet deadlines, reports may be faxed or
emailed on the due date to the Pretreatment Coordinator. The original of the

   (A)   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within 20 working days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Pretreatment Coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may initiate a pretreatment review for
any violation issued under division (A) of this section but most likely for the
first violation of any parameter. Upon the issuance of the pretreatment review,
the village shall schedule a pretreatment review meeting, normally within 30
calendar days of the determination that a meeting is required. As a result of a
pretreatment review meeting, the village may issue a compliance directive
stating that the user is in a "corrective action" status. A plan for correction
and compliance schedule illustrating milestones may be issued by the village to
the user. This plan for correction and compliance schedule may become part of
the user's permit. The user is responsible for meeting the permit limits at all
times. The plan for correction, compliance schedule and revised permit do not
relieve the user of meeting the permit limits and/or ordinance requirements.
The user shall take whatever actions are necessary to meet the permit limits
and permit conditions.
   (C)   As a result of a violation, the village may continue to sample the
user and inspect the user's progress towards meeting milestones as needed to
determine if the user is complying with the conditions of the plan of action,
compliance schedule and/or permit. In the event the village detects and
documents any violation; a NOV will be issued to the user.   
   (D)   Each detected violation of the plan of action, compliance schedule,
and permit, will result in an NOV being issued to the user. Failure to comply
with the NOV requirements may result in the issuance of a citation requiring
the user to appear in DuPage County Circuit Court.
   (E)   When the user has met the conditions of the plan of action, compliance
schedule, and permit, the village will notify the user in writing that the
conditions have been satisfied and they are no longer under a "corrective
action" status if such a status was formally issued.   
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Pretreatment
Coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a votice of violation.    
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-14-2 COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS.
   The Pretreatment Coordinator may enter into compliance agreements, i.e.
consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents
shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to §§
13-14-4 and
13-14-5 and shall be judicially enforceable.

permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the representatives of the village and show cause
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten working days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause
hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

§ 13-14-4 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 13-14-5 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and   
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2020-06-18, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 13-14-6 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Pretreatment Coordinator may also immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when
the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
in §
13-14-7 are initiated against the user.    
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Pretreatment Coordinator prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under §§
13-14-3 or
13-14-7.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Article 6 of this
chapter.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
13-14-3 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Village Board shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.

DuPage County through the Village Attorney for civil penalties as follows:
   (A)   Any user shall be fined in the amount of not less than $1,000 or more
than $1,500 for each violation. Each day a violation exists or continues to
exist shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of a monthly or other
long-term average discharge limit, each day a violation exists or continues
shall constitute a separate violation.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may recover costs, including but not
limited to, filing fees, witness fees, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other
fees and expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
village.   
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.

Section
   
13-17-1   Upset
   
13-17-2   Bypass
§ 13-17-1 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:    
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;    
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and    
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Pretreatment Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written report must be provided within
five working days):    
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.    
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.   
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 13-17-2 BYPASS.
   (A).   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user's treatment or pretreatment facility.
      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Pretreatment Coordinator, at least ten
working days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the Pretreatment
Coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five working days of the time
the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   POTW actions.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Pretreatment Coordinator may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Pretreatment Coordinator
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of
this section.

endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the Department within 15 days of receipt of the emergency order.

§ 13-21-19 NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Whenever a nuisance shall be found to exist on any premise, the
Director may order such nuisance to be abated upon determination that the
nuisance constitutes a threat to public health or safety.
   (B)   In the event of an emergency situation, as determined by the Director,
involving an immediate threat to public health and safety, the Director may
direct legal counsel to immediately commence any legal or equitable proceeding
necessary to restrain, abate and/or remedy said situation. The Director may
take such action without having to first issue a notice of violation to the
person(s) having control of, or acting as agent for, such premise where the
nuisance is located, or, waiting for such person(s) to abate or remove such
nuisance as previously ordered by the Director.
   (C)   In all other cases, the Director may notify, in writing, the person(s)
having control of, or acting as agent for, such premises where the nuisance is
located and directing such person(s) to abate or remove such nuisance within
such time as is stated on the notice. Upon the failure or refusal of such
person(s) to comply with the notice, the Director may direct that appropriate
proceeding commence to compel the abatement, or removal, of such a nuisance in
any manner allowed by law, equity or this article and/or authorizing the
Department to act to abate, or remove, such nuisance. The person(s) having
control of such premises, in addition to the other remedies provided by this
article, shall be liable to the Department for any costs incurred by the
Department to effect such abatement, or removal, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and other costs of enforcement, to be recovered by a court of

normal attempts to notify the owner have been made, after 14 days after the
time of the discovery of the graffiti the village shall have the right, but not
the duty to remove the graffiti from the exterior or private property. A notice
will be left at the property and a certified letter sent to the property owner
of record advising them of the graffiti abatement.

(D)(1) or (D)(2) of this section and if an invoice was is not paid within 30
days, the village shall be entitled to initiate collection actions and file a
notice of lien against the property upon which the work was performed for the
cost of the removal.
   (E)   Penalty.

section, there shall be imposed a fine of not less than $100, nor more than

provisions of division (B) of this section make full and complete restitution
to the owner of the property for expenses incurred in the removal of the

building or surface to its previous condition. In addition, the court may order

order granting the village permission to enter the property and to make an
effort to remove the graffiti and to charge the cost of the removal to the
owner and to permit the village to secure its costs either through an order
directing the owner to pay the costs incurred by or on behalf of the village in
an attempt to remove the graffiti, or to file a lien against the property.
   (F)   Compliance by village.

any jurisdiction; and
         (b)   Report to and appear in person before such person or agency as
directed by the court.

that the defendant:
         (a)   Work or pursue a course of study or vocational training;
         (b)   Undergo medical or psychiatric treatment for drug addiction or
alcoholism;
         (c)   Make restitution or reparation in an amount not to exceed actual

to his or her own support at home or in a foster home.
      (3)   When a court orders restitution or reparation as a condition of
conditional discharge, the court shall determine the amount and conditions of
payment. When the conditions of payment have not been satisfied, the court at
any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period of conditional
discharge may impose an additional period of not more than six months. Only the
conditions of payment shall continue to apply during such additional period.
The court shall retain all of the incidents of the original sentence, including
the authority to modify or enlarge the original conditions to revoke the
penalty of the conditional discharge if the conditions of payment are violated
during such additional period.
      (4)   When a petition is filed charging a violation of a condition
imposed for conditional discharge, the court:
         (a)   May order a summons to the offender to appear, or order a
warrant for the offender’s arrest where there is danger of his or her fleeing
the jurisdiction or causing serious harm to others or when the offender fails
to answer a summons. The issuance of such warrant or summons shall stay the
sentence of conditional discharge until the final determination of the charge,

not answered the summons or warrant;

admit the offender to bail pending the hearing;

confrontation, cross-examination and representation by counsel. The village has
the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving the violation by the
preponderance of the evidence;
         (d)   Shall not revoke a conditional discharge for failure to comply
with conditions of a sentence which imposes financial obligations upon the
offender unless such failure is due to his or her willful refusal to pay; and
         (e)   May modify the conditions of a conditional discharge on motion
of the village or on its own motion or at the request of the offender after
notice to all parties and a hearing.
      (5)   If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at
any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue
the offender on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging the
conditions, or may impose any other penalty that was available at the time of
the initial penalty.
      (6)   A judgement revoking conditional discharge is a final appealable
order.
§ 14-1-17 LIABILITY OF PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OF MINOR OFFENDER.
   The parent or legal guardian of a minor defendant who resides with such
parent or legal guardian shall be liable for any fine or condition of
restitution or reparation imposed by a court upon a minor for actual damages

property, provided that such minor has not paid such fine or made restitution
or reparation within the time ordered by the court, and further provided that

reasonable time.

39.2 of the Act and are not inconsistent with the regulations promulgated by
the Illinois Pollution Control Board; or
      (3)   Deny the petition.
   (B)   In its decision, the Village Board shall state whether it finds that
the applicant has established, and whether the public record supports the
establishment of each of the following criteria:
      (1)   The facility is necessary to accommodate the waste needs of the
area it is intended to serve;
      (2)   The facility is so designed, located and proposed to be operated
that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;
      (3)   The facility is located so as to minimize the incompatibility with
the character of the surrounding area and to minimize the effect on the value
of the surrounding property;
      (4)   For a transfer facility or facility other than a sanitary landfill
or waste disposal site, the facility is located outside the boundary of the
100-year floodplain or the site is floodproofed; and for a facility that is a
sanitary landfill or waste disposal site, the facility is located outside the
boundary of the 100-year floodplain; or if the facility is a facility described
in subsection (b)(3) of § 22.19a of the Act, the site is floodproofed;
      (5)   The plan of operations for the facility is designed to minimize the
danger to the surrounding area from fire, spills or other operational
accidents;
      (6)   The traffic patterns to or from the facility are so designed as to
minimize the impact on existing traffic flows;

waste, an emergency response plan exists for the facility, which includes
notification, containment and evacuation procedures to be used in case of an
accidental release;
      (8)   The consistency of the facility with the county’s Solid Waste
Management Plan, including any updates of that plan; and
      (9)   If the facility is located in a regulated recharge area, any
applicable requirements specified by the Illinois Pollution Control Board for
such areas have been met.
   (C)   The Village Board shall consider as evidence the previous operating
experience and past record of convictions or admissions of violations of the
applicant (and any subsidiary, parent corporation, or subsidiary of the parent
corporation) in the field of solid waste management, when considering the
second and fifth criteria of the Act, and divisions (B)(2) and (B)(5) above.
   (D)   (1)   In making its decision, the Village Board shall consider the
public record of the hearing proceedings.
      (2)   The Village Board shall give greater evidentiary weight to sworn
testimony and evidence presented during the public hearings than to unsworn,
oral or written comment.
   (E)   No determination by the Village Board of a petition may be
reconsidered, except to the extent it is reversed and remanded on appeal and
the Village Board is directed by the Illinois Pollution Control Board or
Illinois Appellate Court to conduct all or part of the review process again.
   (F)   Any Village Board member may be excused from participation in the
hearing and decision, upon demonstration of any disqualifying direct and
personal interest in the property or the affairs of the applicant or any
objector to the proceedings.

of the Administrative Hearing Officer. The purpose of administrative hearings
is to provide a prompt resolution of the alleged Code violation, and

   (E)   The Administrative Adjudication Administrator, with the advice and
consent of the Administrative Hearing Officer, shall determine the manner in
which the record shall be preserved. Such preservation may be made by tape
recording or other appropriate means. Recording by any means by any member of

in the amount of $25 shall be imposed. All fines and costs must be paid within
seven days after the date of determination of liability.
   (G)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Administrative Hearing Officer
shall inform the parties orally and in writing of his determination, which
determination constitutes a final determination for purposes of judicial review
and is subject to review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law. Based on
the charging document and the evidence admitted, the Administrative Hearing
Officer may issue the following determinations: liable, not liable, or liable
upon a plea of no contest. The Administrative Hearing Officer also may dismiss

   (F)   The original or a legible copy of the notice of violation, citation,
or other charging document shall be filed with the Administrative Adjudication
Administrator as soon as practicable at the place and in the manner as the
Administrative Adjudication Administrator directs. Upon receiving the original
or legible copy of the charging document, the Administrative Adjudication
Administrator shall select a hearing date and give respondent notice of the
date, time, and place of the hearing in the manner set forth in division (D) of
this section, unless the charging document sets forth the date, time, and
location of the hearing and was served personally on the respondent.
   (G)   Parties to an adjudicatory hearing may be represented by an attorney
or other agent, present witnesses, and cross-examine opposing witnesses.
Parties may request the Administrative Hearing Officer to issue subpoenas.

the respondent of the procedure for setting aside the default judgment and
shall also apprise the respondent of the availability of an appeal of the
default judgment to the Circuit Court of DuPage County.

not exist shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law. The findings, decision and
order of the hearing officer shall be subject to review in the Circuit Court of
DuPage County.
(Ord. 2019-07-22, passed 7-15-2019)
§ 15-10-9 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the
failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures under the Administrative Review
Law (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.) shall be a debt due and owing the
village and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
   (B)   After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.) may be sought
for a final determination of the Code violation, unless stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision and order of the hearing officer
may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   In any case in which a respondent has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering a defendant to correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other
sanction as a result of a code violation, any expenses incurred by a
municipality to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney's
fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure,
after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer,
shall be a debt due and owing the municipality and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a hearing
officer pursuant to this division (C), the village shall provide notice to the
respondent that states that the respondent shall appear at a hearing before the
Administrative Hearing Officer to determine whether the respondent has failed
to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a hearing,
which shall not be less than seven days from the date that notice is served. If
notice is served by mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on the date
that the notice was deposited in the mail.
   (D)   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Code
of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed
on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount
of any debt due and owing the municipality under this section. The lien may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

this UDO, the following rules shall apply.
      (1)   District boundary lines shall be on the lines of railroads,
highways, streets or easements or the boundary lines of sections, quarter
sections, divisions of sections, tracts or lots, or such lines extended unless
otherwise indicated.
      (2)   In areas not subdivided into lots and blocks, whenever a district
is indicated as a strip adjacent and parallel to a street or highway, the depth
of such strips shall be in accordance with the dimensions shown on the maps
measured at right angles from the centerline of the street or highway, and the
length of frontage shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on the maps
from sections, quarter sections or division lines in centerlines of streets,
highways or railroad rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated.
      (3)   Where a lot held in one ownership and of record on the effective
date of this UDO is divided by a district boundary line, the entire lot shall
be construed to be within the less restricted district; provided that, this
shall not apply if it increases the frontage of the lot by more than 25 feet
required in the less restricted district.
   (C)   Zoning of streets, easements, public ways, waterways and railroad
rights-of-way. All streets, easements, public ways, waterways and railroad
rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be
in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such streets,
easements, public ways, waterways and railroad rights-of-way. Where any of the
above rights-of-way serve as district boundaries, the zoning of such areas,
unless otherwise designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the
abutting property up to such centerline.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-3-3 ZONING OF ANNEXED LAND.

§ 16-3-5 BUSINESS DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose of Business Districts. Business zoning districts are
established, designed, and intended to provide a comfortable, healthy, safe,
and pleasant environment in which to shop, dine, obtain various services, and
to:
      (1)   Accommodate retail, commercial, service, and mixed uses needed by
Carol Stream residents, businesses, visitors, and workers;
      (2)   Maintain and enhance the village's economic base and provide
shopping, entertainment, restaurant, service and other nonresidential uses
close to where people live and work;
      (3)   Create suitable environments for various types of business uses and
protect them from the adverse effects of incompatible uses;
      (4)   Allow flexibility to encourage redevelopment and improvements to
existing businesses; and
      (5)   Help ensure that the appearance and operational impacts of business
uses do not adversely affect the character of the areas in which they are
located.
   (B)   Town Center District - B-1. (See Figure 16-3-5(B))
      (1)   Purpose. The B-1 District is established to foster the growth and
development of the village's "Town Center". The intent of this district is to
provide for a variety of retail, office, service, residential, and cultural
amenities in a central setting. While visitors are likely to access the B- 1
district by vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian facilities and circulation within
the district are prioritized.
      (2)   Dimensional standards. Setbacks in the B-1 District shall be as
established through the Planned Development and Gary Avenue Corridor Review
Processes.

   (C)   Neighborhood Business District - B-2. (See
Figure 16-3-5(C))
      (1)   Purpose. The B-2 District is established to provide and preserve
areas that offer access to goods and services that residents and the general
public need on a day-to-day basis. The intent of this district is to provide
neighborhood-scale business uses without negatively impacting quality of life
due to noise, traffic, or other issues related to high intensity business uses.

   (D)   General Business District - B-3. (See
Figure 16-3-5(D))
      (1)   Purpose. The B-3 District is established to provide and preserve
areas along highly visible and accessible road corridors that provide for a
broad range of retail, wholesale, and service uses. Because of the scale and
access requirements of uses in this district, they often cannot be compatibly
integrated within the Town Center or Neighborhood Business Districts.
Development at district boundaries must provide a compatible transition to uses
outside the district.

§ 16-3-6 OFFICE, SERVICE, AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General purpose of Office, Service, and Industrial Districts. Office,
service, and industrial zoning districts are established, designed, and
intended to provide a healthy and safe environment in which to work and to:
      (1)   Maintain and enhance the village's economic base and provide
employment opportunities;
      (2)   Preserve, protect, and promote employment-generating uses;
      (3)   Minimize potential negative impacts of office and industrial
development on adjacent business and residential areas; and
      (4)   Help ensure that the appearance and operational impacts of office,
service, and industrial developments do not adversely affect the character of
the areas in which they are located.
   (B)   Office and Service District - O-S. (See
Figure 16-3-6(B))
      (1)   Purpose. This district is established to provide and preserve areas
for a wide range of office and service uses including research and development,
total senior life care communities, office-flex, and large employment
facilities such as those in a planned office campus or headquarters
development. This district also accommodates limited supporting commercial uses
as a means to support daily needs for employees within the district.

   (C)   Industrial District - I. (See
Figure 16-3-6(C))
      (1)   Purpose. This district is established to provide for industrial and
manufacturing uses which may be intensive in nature. This district is intended
to accommodate uses that require extensive exterior movement of trucks,
vehicles, goods, or other exterior operations. This district should not be
located adjacent to residence districts, and its contiguity to commercial and
business areas should, wherever possible, be avoided. Unless specifically
permitted, all business, processing, storage and all other activities and
operations shall be conducted completely within the principal building.

§ 16-3-7 OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   All provisions of the UDO, to the extent that they do not conflict
with the standards delineated in this section, shall remain in full force and
effect for all properties subject to the provisions of this section.
   (B)   The standards found in this section shall be used by property owners,
developers, village staff members, the Plan Commission and the Village Board
during the design and review of development and redevelopment proposals within
the overlay districts. These standards and criteria complement and add to those
contained within the village's Comprehensive Plan, Gary Avenue Corridor Plan,
the UDO and other land use regulations. In the event of conflict between
regulatory ordinances, those contained in this section shall take precedence
over all others.
   (C)   Gary Avenue and North Avenue Corridor Overlay District - GAC and NAC.
(See
Figure 16-3-7(C))
      (1)   Purpose. The Gary Avenue and North Avenue Corridors and the
development within them are major factors influencing the visual and
environmental quality of the village. At full development, the Corridor will
contain the village's Town Center, other retail nodes, significant industrial
and employment concentrations, public institutions, recreational facilities and
residential development. Due to the intensity of these land uses, Gary Avenue
and North Avenue represent the heart of the village, as well as a prominent
image to those passing through the community. The purpose of the Gary Avenue
and North Avenue Corridors is to:
         (a)   Create a unified, harmonious and high-quality visual environment
throughout the Gary Avenue and North Avenue Corridors, thereby identifying them
as special areas with a unique identity within the village and the region;
         (b)   Promote high-quality design through improved development
standards within the Corridors. These standards, which govern site planning,
building design, and landscaping will enable the village to enhance what
otherwise might result in aesthetically and economically lower quality strip
development;
         (c)   Foster a distinctive and positive image for the village and for
the Gary Avenue and North Avenue Corridors which function as principal gateway
into the village; and
         (d)   Protect and enhance wetlands and other significant natural
resources through use of careful site design, protective easements, sensitive
alignment and design of roadways and utilities, incorporation of natural
features, landscaping and massing of trees.
      (2)   Dimensional standards. The dimensional standards of the underlying
zoning district shall apply unless otherwise specified in §
16-5-16.

(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-3-8 CONTROL OVER BULK.
   (A)   Generally. Unless variations are granted pursuant to the variation
provisions of this UDO, or unless site development allowances are granted
through the Planned Development process as provided in
Article 16-7, all new buildings shall conform to the bulk regulations
established in this UDO for the district in which each building is located, and
no existing building shall be enlarged, reconstructed, structurally altered,
converted or relocated in such a manner as to conflict with the bulk
regulations in this UDO for the district in which such buildings shall be
located.
   (B)   Maintenance of yards, courts, and other open spaces. The maintenance
of yards, courts, and other open spaces and minimum lot area legally required
for a building shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such building
or of the property on which it is located, as long as the building is in
existence. Furthermore, no legally required yards, courts or other open space
or minimum lot area allocated to any building shall, by virtue of change of
ownership or for any other reason, be used to satisfy yard, court, other open
space or minimum lot area requirements for any other building.
   (C)   Location of required open spaces. All yards, courts and other open
spaces allocated to a building or group of buildings shall be located on the
same zoning lot as such building or group of buildings.
   (D)   Required yard for existing buildings. No yards on or hereafter
provided for a building existing on the effective date of this UDO shall
subsequently be reduced below, or further reduced below if already less than
the minimum yard requirements of this UDO for equivalent new construction.
   (E)   Calculating dimensions.
      (1)   Yards.
         (a)   The required front yard setback shall be measured as the
shortest distance between the building and the front property line.
         (b)   The required side yard or rear yard setback shall be measured by
the shortest distance between the building and the lot line.
      (2)   The vertical distance measured from the sidewalk level or its
equivalent established grade opposite the middle of the front of the building
to the highest elevation of the roof in the case of a slant or flat roof; to
the deck line of a mansard roof; and to the mean height level between eaves and
ridge of a gable, hip or gambrel roof; provided that, where buildings are set
back from the street line, the height of the building may be measured from the
average elevation of the finished lot grade at the front of the building (see
Figure 16-3-8 (F)(2)).

   (3)   Lot coverage. The part or percent of the lot occupied by a combination
of building and accessory uses covering the lot area, not including driveways
but including parking pads (see Figures 16-3-8 (F)(3)). For properties zoned R-
1, R-2, and R-3 with single-unit detached dwelling units, not more than 30% of
the lot area may be occupied by buildings and structures, including accessory
buildings except when structural coverage includes lot area covered by a
swimming pool or by a deck which collects water or allows water to penetrate
into the ground underneath the deck and where the area underneath the deck is
covered with agricultural paper, cloth or other pervious sheeting, in which
case only the area of the swimming pool or deck shall be permitted to exceed
30% of the lot area up to a maximum of 35% of the lot area.

(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021; Ord. 2023-01-01, passed 1-16-2023)
§ 16-4-10 ADULT ORIENTED USES.
   Adult oriented uses shall be permitted uses in the Industrial District and
shall meet the following provisions:
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to regarding the location of sexually oriented businesses
in the municipality in order to minimize and control negative secondary effects
associated with sexually oriented businesses within the municipality thereby
promoting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the municipality.
The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor the effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials or communication, including sexually oriented entertainment.
Similarly, it is not the purpose, nor effect of this section to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Furthermore, it is not the
intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution or
exhibition of entertainment that is obscene.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses the Village of Carol Stream finds the
following: Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (1)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos or live sexually
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (2)   Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation
between sexually oriented business and a decrease in the residential and
commercial property values that surround them, especially those properties
within 1,000 feet of such businesses.
      (3)   Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation
between sexually oriented businesses and increased crime in the neighborhood,
including sex-related crimes like prostitution, obscenity and sexual assault.
This correlation is especially acute when more than one sexually oriented
business is located in a neighborhood, and when a sexually oriented business is
located near a public open space such as a park, cemetery or school.
      (4)   Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation
between sexually oriented businesses and increased harassment and
propositioning of women, children and the elderly in the neighborhood.
      (5)   Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation
between sexually oriented businesses and offensive material such as
pornographic magazines and used condoms being discarded in the surrounding
neighborhood, making them available to children.
      (6)   Location of sexually oriented businesses in a neighborhood can
create a "sex for sale" reputation in a neighborhood.
      (7)   The foregoing findings raise substantial governmental interests and
concerns.
      (8)   The municipality cannot entirely prohibit sexually oriented
businesses which are not obscene from locating within the municipality.
      (9)   The municipality can affect reasonable locational regulations to
which it believes will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects
associated with sexually oriented businesses.
      (10)   Locating sexually oriented businesses in the Industrial Zone will
ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually
oriented business.
      (11)   Requiring sexually oriented businesses to be located 1,000 feet
from any other sexually oriented businesses will ameliorate these deleterious
secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses.
      (12)   Requiring sexually oriented businesses to be located 1,000 feet
from any school, day care center, cemetery, public park including any lineal
recreational area like a bike path, forest preserve, public housing, place of
religious worship, lot zoned for residential purposes and lot used for
residential purposes, complies with the requirements of state law 65 ILCS 5/11-
5-1.5, and will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with
sexually oriented businesses.
      (13)   North Avenue is the main thoroughfare in the municipality, and
more than any other location in the municipality reflects on the economic
status of the municipality.
      (14)   Accordingly, a decrease in the property values and an increase in
visible crime along North Avenue will affect the property values of the
municipality as a whole in a way that other locations would not.
      (15)   Preventing sexually oriented businesses from locating directly on,
or within 500 feet of North Avenue will help to conserve property values in the
municipality as a whole, while still providing an adequate number of sites and
acreage available for the location of sexually oriented businesses.
   (C)   Permitted use. Any other ordinance or section of any ordinance
notwithstanding, and subject to the setback requirements of §
16-3-11(B), sexually oriented businesses shall be a permitted use only in the I
Industrial District. Sexually oriented businesses shall not be a special use in
any district.
   (D)   Setback requirements. No sexually oriented business shall be located:
      (1)   Within 1,000 feet of the lot line of any other sexually oriented
business, and any school, day care center, cemetery, public park including any
lineal recreational area like a bike path, forest preserve, public housing,
place of religious worship, lot zoned for residential purposes and lot used for
residential purposes;
      (2)   Within 500 feet of the centerline of North Avenue, which 500 feet
shall be measured from the nearest lot line, or portion of the building in
which the sexually oriented business is located to the nearest point of the
centerline of North Avenue; and
      (3)   On a lot which physically touches North Avenue.
   (E)   Restriction on use. All sexually oriented businesses shall be
conducted entirely within a fully enclosed business. No sexually oriented
business shall be operated in any manner that permits the observation from
outside the building of any image, material or entertainment depicting or
describing excretory functions, specified sexual activities or specified

§ 16-5-1 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   Any use established in the Village of Carol Stream shall be operated in such
a manner as to comply with applicable performance standards as hereinafter set
forth governing noise, smoke, particulate matter, toxic or noxious matter,
odors, fire and explosive hazards, vibration, radiation or glare or heat for
the district in which such use shall be located; and no use already established
on the effective date of this chapter shall be so altered or modified as to
conflict with, or further conflict with, applicable performance standards for
the district in which such use is located. Failure to comply with such
applicable performance standards shall constitute a nuisance.
   (A)   Noise. No activity or use shall be conducted in a manner that
generates a level of sound, as measured on another property, greater than that
allowed by federal, state, county, and local regulations. These limits shall
not apply to construction noises, noises emanating from safety signals or
warning devices, noises not directly under the control of the owner or occupant
of the property, and transient noises from moving sources, such as motor
vehicles, railroads, and aircraft.
   (B)   Vibration. No activity or use shall be conducted in a manner that
generates earthborn vibration that can be detected at any point off the lot on
which the use is located.
   (C)   Dust and air pollution. Dust and air pollution carried by the wind

discharge, clean up, and disposal of all hazardous, radioactive, or toxic
materials, including waste, shall comply with applicable federal, state,
county, and local regulations.
   (E)   Odor. No activity or use shall be conducted in a manner that generates
odors of such intensity and character as to be harmful to the health, welfare,
or comfort of the public. Any such use shall be stopped or modified so as to
remove the odor.
   (F)   Fire and explosion hazards. Materials that present potential fire and
explosion hazards shall be transported, stored, and used only in conformance

§ 16-5-2 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   General provisions; parking and loading.
      (1)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions
of this chapter shall apply as follows.
         (a)   Accessory off-street parking and off-street loading facilities
shall be provided as required by the regulations of this section for all
buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established in each
district after the effective date of this chapter. When the intensity of use of
any building, structure, or premises shall be increased through addition of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other units of
measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities,
parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such
increase in intensity of use.
         (b)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional parking or
loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements
for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were
subject to the parking and loading provisions herein.
      (2)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street
parking and/or loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this
chapter and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not
hereafter be reduced below the requirements of this chapter for a similar new
building or use.
      (3)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or nonconforming building
or use in existence on the effective date of this chapter and which is
reconstructed, reestablished or repaired as allowed by this UDO, which
subsequently is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other
cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-street
parking and loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such
damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may vary the requirement where it would be impossible or
economically unfeasible to provide the amount of required parking on or near
the site, and where the continuance of the non-conformance will not unduly
interfere with adjoining uses. However, in no case shall it be necessary to
restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required
by this chapter for equivalent new uses or construction.
      (4)   Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are necessary. No such off-site parking
facilities shall be authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued where
the plans call for parking other than on the same zoning lot until and unless
the Zoning Board of Appeals has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and
made findings that the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and
site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that the
off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of
the proposed use or buildings. If, for any reason, the parking required by this
chapter and provided off-site shall no longer be available and replacement
parking is not provided, the owner and occupant of the structure for which
parking has been diminished shall reduce the size of the use within one year
after the date the parking is lost to make the use conform to the then
available parking.
   (B)   Additional regulations; parking. Off-street parking facilities shall
be provided in accordance with additional regulations hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities required
for uses in accordance with division (C) below shall be used solely for the
parking of motor vehicles of patrons, occupants or employees of the principal
use or building. Spaces needed to meet the minimum number of parking spaces
required under division (C) below may not be used for the regular storage or
parking of vehicles, equipment or materials associated with the principal use
on the property. The parking or storage of vehicles, equipment or materials
associated with the principal use on the property on any surplus parking
spaces, beyond the number of spaces required under division (C) below, may only
be done in accordance with provisions contained elsewhere in this code.
Vehicles exceeding the size of the vehicle parking space dimensions, as set
forth in division (B)(5)(d), may not park in such spaces. Off-street parking
facilities accessory to residential use and developed in any residential
district in accordance with the requirements of this section shall be used
solely for the parking of passenger automobiles owned by occupants of the
dwelling structures to which such facilities are accessory or by guests of such
occupants, unless otherwise permitted in division (B)(2) below. Under no
circumstances shall any person use or allow to be used a required parking
facility accessory to residential structures for the storage of trucks or other
commercial vehicles or for the parking of automobiles belonging to the
employees, owners, tenants, visitors or customers of business or manufacturing
establishments, or for the parking or storage of licensed or unlicensed
construction equipment or vehicles.
      (2)   Shared parking facilities.
         (a)   Purpose. Shared parking is encouraged as a means of conserving
land resources, reducing stormwater runoff, reducing the heat island effect
caused by large paved areas, and improving community appearance.
         (b)   Authorization. Shared parking facilities for off-street parking
of two or more buildings or uses may be approved by the Village Board subject
to compliance with this section.
         (c)   Location. Shared parking facilities shall be located within 300
linear feet of the primary entrance of the main residential building and within
500 linear feet of the primary entrance of the main nonresidential building.
         (d)   General requirements.
            I.   The number of parking spaces provided shall not be less than
the sum of the separate requirements for each such building or use. Where a mix
of two or more land uses creates staggered peak periods of parking demand,
shared parking agreements that have the effect of reducing the total amount of
required parking may be approved.
            II.   Required accessible parking spaces for persons with
disabilities may not be shared and shall be located on-site.
            III.   Adjacent lots that are subject to a shared parking agreement
shall be interconnected by the provision of a cross-access easement for
vehicular and pedestrian passage.
         (e)   Shared parking for uses with different hours of operation.
            I.   For purposes of this section, the following uses are
considered daytime uses:
               i.   Office uses;
               ii.   Commercial service uses;
               iii.   Commercial retail uses;
               iv.   Industrial uses;
               v.   Other similar primarily daytime uses, as determined by the
Village Board.
            II.   For purposes of this section, the following uses are
considered evening or weekend uses:
               i.   Physical health and entertainment uses;
               ii.   Public/semi-public uses;
               iii.   Eating and drinking uses; and
               iv.   Other similar primarily nighttime or weekend uses, as
determined by the Village Board.
         (f)   Shared parking study. The applicant(s) shall demonstrate,
through a shared parking study, that there is no substantial conflict in the
peak periods of parking demand of the uses for which shared parking is
proposed. The shared parking analysis shall include, at minimum, the size and
type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated
rate of parking turnover and the anticipated hourly and peak parking and
traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing parking spaces. If existing
land uses are to be included in the shared parking agreement, the study shall
also include parking counts that document parking occupancy during weekday,
weekend, daytime, and evening periods of peak and off-peak parking demand.
         (g)   Agreement. The applicant(s) shall provide a copy of the executed
shared parking agreement prior to the Village Board's authorization of a shared
parking facility permit.
            I.   Shared parking agreements shall have a term of not less than
five years, including any renewals at the option of the lessee.
            II.   Authorization of the shared parking facility will continue in
effect only as long as the agreement, binding on all parties, remains in force.
Should the agreement cease to be in force, parking must be provided as
otherwise required by this section.
      (3)   Design and maintenance (See
Figure 16-5-2(B)(3)).
         (a)   Open and enclosed parking spaces. Accessory parking spaces may
be open to the sky, enclosed or semi-enclosed in a building or structure.
Enclosed parking spaces shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet.
         (b)   Surfacing. Except as otherwise provided in this UDO, all open
parking spaces and access thereto shall be improved with all-weather material,
in accordance with specifications approved by the Engineering Services
Director.
         (c)   Temporary parking lots. The Village Board may grant approval for
the construction of a temporary parking lot. Such temporary parking lot shall
be located outside of all required landscape areas and constructed of such
material including, but not limited to, gravel, which shall be approved by the
Engineering Services Director as providing a firm base to vehicles, and such
temporary parking lot shall be adequately drained. A permit to maintain a
temporary parking lot shall be granted only under those circumstances which
would make the construction of a permanent parking lot an economic hardship
upon the applicant. Temporary parking lot permits shall be valid for a maximum
of 18 months, and shall not be renewable.
         (d)   Barrier protection. Bollards or other means of protection shall
be installed by the developer, business owner, or property owner when deemed
necessary by the Community Development Director or Village Board in instances
when the relationship between parking spaces and the building or pedestrian
facilities requires additional protection.
         (e)   Minimum parking area dimension requirements. Plans for the
layout of off-street parking facilities shall be in accordance with the
following requirements.
         (f)   Striping. Striping between spaces shall be in the form of a four
inch hair-pin/looped line, 16 inches apart, and shall be white or yellow in
color.

inch hair-pin/looped line, 16 inches apart.
      (4)   Location of accessory off-street parking facilities. Required
parking spaces shall not be located within the public right-of-way. The
location of off-street parking spaces in relation to the use served shall be as
prescribed hereinafter. All distances specified shall be walking distances
between such parking spaces and a main entrance to the use served.
         (a)   For uses in residential districts.
            I.   Parking spaces serving multiunit and non-residential uses
shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use served.
            II.   Parking spaces serving multiunit uses shall not be located
more than 30 feet from a convenient entrance to the building. Parking lots
shall be so designed so at least one parking space per dwelling unit is within
150 feet of a building entrance.
            III.   Parking spaces serving multiunit and non-residential uses
shall not be located:
               i.   nearer than 40 feet from an adjoining single-unit
residential lot, nor
               ii.   less than 20 feet from a street right-of-way line.
               iii.   No on-site roadway or parking lot pavement of any type
shall be located within ten feet from a street right-of-way line, except for
approved entry drives.
            IV.   No commercial vehicles bearing a class designation other than
A or B under the provisions of Illinois State Statutes shall be parked or
stored on any residential premises classified as a residential district, except
when making a delivery or rendering a service at such premises.
            V.   Unless in compliance with §
16-5-2(B)(4)(a)(IV), no construction equipment or vehicles, or service
equipment or vehicles, shall be parked or stored in a residential district,
unless such equipment or vehicle is being used for the purpose of construction,
alteration, excavation, service or repair of a property within a residential
district. In the event that such equipment or vehicle is not being used in the
construction, alteration, excavation, service or repair of property in a
residential district, such equipment or vehicle shall not be parked or stored
overnight unless it is parked or stored at least 500 feet from an occupied
residence. Maintenance equipment may be stored in a garage in multiunit
properties. Equipment and/or materials used solely for on-site snow plowing may
be stored on the premises where such equipment and/or materials will be used
during the period from November 1 through March 31 each season.
         (b)   For uses in non-residential districts.
            I.   All required parking spaces shall be located within 500 feet
of the use served. However, no parking spaces accessory to a use in a business
district shall be located in a residential district, except that private, free,
off-street parking accessory to business district uses and municipal parking
lots may be allowed by special use permit in accordance with
Article 16-8, within 200 feet of the site served and adjacent to any business
district.
            II.   Parking spaces shall not be located:
               i.   nearer than 40 feet from an adjoining lot in a residence
district, nor
               ii.   less than 20 feet from a street right-of-way line.
               iii.   No on-site roadway or parking lot pavement of any type
shall be located within ten feet of a street right-of-way line, except for
approved entry drives.
            III.   Landbanking of required parking spaces as greenspace may be
permitted when approved as a variation, provided the owner of the property
demonstrates through employee counts that the total number of parking spaces
required using the square footage parking requirements outlined herein are not
necessary and there is sufficient usable land area available on the subject
property to provide the required parking spaces if deemed necessary by the
village in the future.
            IV.   Equipment and/or materials used solely for on-site snow
plowing, which may include covered salt or de-icing material, may be stored on
the premises where such equipment and/or materials will be used during the
period from November 1 through March 31 each season.
   (C)   Schedule of parking requirements. The requirements listed in
Table 16-5-2 (C) shall be the minimum requirement for off-street parking spaces
for the associated use(s). In making determination of required parking, the
Community Development Director shall consider the component parts of the
development including varying standards for individual uses. Speculative
industrial buildings shall provide parking in accordance with the ratio for
general office uses for a minimum of 5% of the net floor area of the building.
Unless otherwise approved by the Community Development Director, the maximum
permitted number of accessory off-street parking spaces shall be an additional
20% beyond the minimum requirement. Unless otherwise indicated, the number of
required off-street parking spaces shall be determined by the net floor area of
the use. The net floor area shall be the sum of the net horizontal floor area
of the several floors of a building as measured from the exterior faces of the
exterior walls.
      (1)   The net floor area of a building shall include:
         (a)   Basements, when used for other than storage;
         (b)   Penthouse, excluding mechanical penthouses;
         (c)   Attic space having headroom of seven feet six inches or more;
         (d)   Interior balconies and mezzanines;
         (e)   Enclosed porches; and
         (f)   Floor area devoted to warehouse storage areas.
      (2)   The net floor area (NFA) of a building shall not include:
         (a)   Floor space occupied by mechanical, telephone and electrical
equipment, including mechanical penthouses, coolers, freezers and refrigeration
units, and similar equipment;
         (b)   Stairwells, escalators and elevator shafts;

entrances to adjacent public rights-of-way along direct routes that do not
require significant out-of-direction travel if sidewalks or pedestrian paths
exist along the public right-of-way.
      (4)   The on-site pedestrian circulation system shall provide at least
one connection to adjacent properties along a shared street frontage.
Connections must provide access to existing walkways on adjacent properties, or
to the likely future location of walkways on those properties. The Director of
Engineering Services may waive this requirement upon determining that no
walkway exists, a future walkway is unlikely to exist, or such connection would
create a safety hazard.
   (E)   Bicycle parking requirements.
      (1)   Purpose. This section is established to ensure the provision of
bicycle parking facilities in furtherance of a safe, complete, and efficient
network of streets, bicycle-pedestrian facilities and other infrastructure to
serve users in any surface transportation mode.
      (2)   Location.
         (a)   Required bicycle parking shall be provided on the same lot as
the use for which it is intended to serve.
         (b)   Bicycle racks shall be located such that they are highly
visible, with adequate lighting, from the street and/or building entrance(s)
from where bicyclists approach.
         (c)   The location of bicycle parking shall not conflict with
pedestrian and/or motor vehicle circulation.
         (d)   Bicycle parking shall be sited within 50 feet of a building's
main entrance. If provided indoors, bicycle parking shall be located within a
common area designated for secure bicycle storage.
         (e)   Bicycle parking adjacent to a pedestrian walkway shall be sited
to ensure that a minimum five foot walkway clearance is maintained.
      (3)   Design criteria.
         (a)   Bicycle parking facilities shall be of high quality.
         (b)   Bicycle racks shall be installed on a hard surface area. The

§ 16-5-3 OUTDOOR LIGHTING.
   (A)   Lighting of off-street areas.
      (1)   Purpose: The purpose of the outdoor lighting standards is:
         (a)   To provide for and control lighting in outdoor public places
where public health, safety and welfare are potential concerns.
         (b)   To protect pedestrians, cyclists and motorists from the
excessive illumination of non- vehicular light sources.
         (c)   To reduce the distribution of stray light upon neighboring
properties and protect neighbors, the environment and the night sky from
nuisance illumination and light trespass from improperly selected or poorly
placed, aimed, applied, maintained or shielded light sources.
         (d)   To promote conservation of energy through energy-efficient
lighting design and operation.
         (e)   To protect and retain the intended visual character of the
various venues of the village and to maintain and improve nighttime aesthetics,
including preservation of the night sky.
      (2)   Applicability: All properties shall comply with the provisions of
this section; however, the requirement to install lighting for parking lots
serving the public at educational and religious institutions or public agencies
may be waived by the Engineering Services Director, upon receipt of a written
request demonstrating justifiable cause.
      (3)   Conformance: Any existing luminaire or lighting installation used
for outdoor lighting in any zoning district on the effective date of this
chapter that does not comply with the requirements of this section shall be
considered a nonconforming use. Existing nonconforming luminaires or light
installations legally installed and operative before the effective date of this
chapter are exempt from compliance with the requirements of this section,
unless such fixtures are deemed a safety hazard by the Community Development
Director or his/her designee.
      (4)   Illumination standards:
         (a)   Light intensity and uniformity. Outdoor lighting on any pavement
shall meet the requirements of
Table 16-5-3(A)(4)(a) for light level as measured in the plane of the

      (1)   Parking lot perimeter area. (See
Figure 16-5-6(B)(1)) All parking lots shall include landscape improvements
located on the perimeter of parking areas as required by this section.
Landscape improvements required by this section shall be in addition to
landscape improvements required under other sections of this chapter. It is the
objective of this section to provide screening between parking areas and street
right-of-way.
         (a)   Applicability. The parking lot perimeter landscape regulations
of this section apply to the following:
            I.   The construction of any new surface parking lot or vehicular
use area that is adjacent to street right-of-way; and
            II.   The expansion of any existing surface parking lot or
vehicular use area that is adjacent to street right-of-way.
         (b)   Exemptions. Installation of parking lot perimeter landscape is
not required when the parking lot or vehicular use area is not visible from
adjacent street right-of-way.
         (c)   Requirements. Perimeter landscape is required for all parking
lots and shall be established along the edge of the parking lot with a minimum
depth of seven feet as measured from the back of curb, to accommodate vehicle
bumper overhang and ensure planting areas that are adequate in size.

      (2)   Parking lot interior area. (See
Figure 16-5-6(B)(2)) All parking lots shall include landscape and trees located
within the parking area as required by this section. Trees and landscape
required by this section shall be in addition to trees and landscape required
under other sections of this chapter. It is the objective of this section to
provide shade within parking areas, break up large expanses of parking lot
pavement, and provide a safe pedestrian environment.
         (a)   Applicability. The parking lot interior landscape regulations of
this section apply to the following:
            I.   The construction of any new surface parking lot containing ten
or more parking spaces; and
            II.   The expansion of any existing surface parking lot if the
expansion would result in ten or more new parking spaces, in which case the
requirements of this section apply only to the expanded area.
         (b)   Requirements. For parking lots consisting of 15 or more spaces,
interior parking lot landscape shall be required. For parking lots consisting
of fewer than 15 spaces, all rows of parking shall be terminated by a parking
lot island or landscape area.
         (c)   Amount. One parking lot island shall be provided between every
15 parking spaces. Parking lot island locations may be varied based on specific
site requirements or design scheme, but the total number of islands shall be no
less than the amount required one island for every 15 spaces. However, all rows
of parking spaces shall be terminated by a parking lot island or landscape
area.
         (d)   Size and planting of parking lot islands. Parking lot islands
shall be the same dimension as the parking stall. Double rows of parking shall
provide parking lot islands that are the same dimension as the double row. A
minimum of one canopy tree shall be provided for every parking lot island or
landscaped area. If the island extends the width of a double row, then two
canopy trees shall be provided.
         (e)   Design of planting areas. Parking lot islands or landscape areas
shall be at least 144 square feet in area and at least six inches above the
surface of the parking lot and protected with concrete curbing, except where
designed as part of a post-construction best management practice. Such islands
and landscape areas shall be properly drained and irrigated as appropriate to
the site conditions to ensure survivability, except where designed as part of a
post-construction best management practice.
         (f)   Type of landscape material. Canopy trees shall be the primary
plant materials used in parking lot islands and landscaped areas. Ornamental
trees, evergreen trees, shrubs, native grasses, groundcover, and other plant
materials may be used to supplement the canopy tree plantings but shall not
create visibility concerns for automobiles and pedestrians.
         (g)   Groundcover. A minimum of 75% of every parking lot island shall
be planted in groundcover.

      (3)   Building foundation area. (See
Figure 16-5-6(B)(3)) All multiunit residential, non-residential, or mixed use
development, with the exception of food processing facilities, shall include
landscape located at the building foundation as required by this section.
Landscape required by this section shall be in addition to landscape required
under other sections of this chapter. It is the objective of this section to
provide a softening effect at the base of buildings.
         (a)   A multiunit residential, non-residential, or mixed use
development is required to maintain a building foundation area at the front and
exterior side yards of five feet at a minimum.
         (b)   Foundation plantings shall be designed to supplement buffer yard
plantings to frame important views, while visually softening long expanses of
walls. Foundation plantings shall correspond to the windows and materials of
the building.
         (c)   Foundation plantings shall be installed across 80% of the length
of the facade of the building, except where walkways and driveways are located.
         (d)   A minimum four foot-wide hedge row shall be planted with one
shrub or native grass every three feet on center, spaced linearly. Foundation
plantings may also include trees, additional shrubs and native grasses, and
groundcover.

      (4)   Transition area. (See
Figure 16-5-6(B)(4)(b)) Transition area landscape shall be required along
interior property lines of all multiunit residential, non-residential, or mixed
use development. It is not expected that the transition area will totally
screen such uses but rather minimize land use conflicts and enhance aesthetics
over time as landscaping matures. Landscape required by this section shall be
in addition to landscape required under other sections of this chapter. It is
the objective of the transition area to minimize possible conflicts between
land uses.
         (a)   Applicability.
            I.   The construction or installation of any new primary building
or primary use; and
            II.   The expansion of any existing primary building or primary use
that results in an increase in gross floor area or site area improvements by
more than 5% or 1,000 square feet, whichever is greater. In the case of
expansions that trigger compliance with transition area requirements,
transition area landscaping is required only in proportion to the degree of
expansion. The Community Development Director is authorized to allow the
transition area to be established adjacent to the area of expansion or to
disperse transition area landscaping along the entire site transition area.
            III.   Primary buildings or uses in the B-1 District shall not be
required to install transition area landscape along interior side yards except
for those that abut a lot not zoned in the B-1 District.
         (b)   Transition area types. Four transition area types are
established in recognition of the different contexts that may exist, as shown
in
Table 16-5-5(B)(4)(b). Transition yards may include a combination of elements
including setback distances for separation, planting types, solid fencing,
groundcover, and turf.

§ 16-6-1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The Village Board find that signs can obstruct views, distract
motorists, displace alternative uses of land and pose other problems that
legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this article is to regulate
the height, area, color, illumination, movement, materials, and condition of
signs placed upon property within the village, thus ensuring public safety, the
protection of property values, the character of neighborhoods, the creation of
a convenient, attractive and harmonious community and the encouragement of
economic development.
   (B)   It is the intent of this article to coordinate the type, placement,
size, and scale of signs within the village's zoning districts and for the
following purposes:
      (1)   To promote and protect public health, safety, comfort, morals,
convenience and general welfare through the reasonable and orderly display of
signs;
      (2)   To encourage the physical appearance of signs to be in harmony with
the visual character of the associated street corridor and to be an integral
part of the aesthetic of the site and architectural style of associated
buildings;
      (3)   To protect the general public, pedestrians, and motorists within
the village by assuring the design, location, construction, and maintenance of
signs presents safe navigation through discernable identification, and does not
create distractions, obstructions, or hazards;
      (4)   To protect the public investment in streets and highways by
reducing sign or advertising distractions that may increase traffic accidents;
      (5)   To ensure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses and the
environment;
      (6)   To foster attractive business areas within the village; and
      (7)   To advance the Village of Carol Stream's implementation of its
Comprehensive Plan.
   (C)   These objectives shall be accomplished through the regulation of the
display, construction, use, and maintenance of signs. However, these
regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by
the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike a balance that
preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while
reducing and mitigating the negative effects caused by signs. Signs shall be
regulated based on their applicable zoning district. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this article, no sign shall be located in any area or in any
manner so as to create a nuisance or a threat to public health, safety, or
welfare.
   (D)   When a sign type is not specifically listed in the sections devoted to
permitted signs, it shall be assumed that such signs are hereby expressly
prohibited. If it is determined by the Community Development Director that such
sign is similar to and not more objectionable than signs listed, such signs may
then be permitted.
   (E)   From and after the effective date of this article, the use of all
signs and portions of signs erected, altered with respect to height and area or
sign face, added to, or relocated in the village shall be in conformity with
the provisions of this article. Any existing sign not in conformity with the
regulations herein prescribed shall be regarded as non-conforming.
   (F)   The regulations contained within this article are the minimum exercise
of the police power required in order to accomplish the purposes of this
article.
   (G)   The regulations contained within this article shall not be applicable
to signs erected and maintained by the Village of Carol Stream, DuPage County,
or State of Illinois for regulatory purposes.

§ 16-6-2 APPLICABILITY TO GARY AVENUE CORRIDOR AND NORTH AVENUE CORRIDOR
OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   Signs placed on properties located within the Gary Avenue Corridor and North
Avenue Corridor Overlay Districts must comply with the regulations contained in
§§
16-8-3 and
16-8-4(A)(4).
   (A)   Signage for new development shall be included in the Gary Avenue or
North Avenue Corridor Development Plans and shall be subject to review and
approval by the Plan Commission in accordance with the procedures defined in §
16-8-4(A)(4).
   (B)   New or replacement monument signs placed on existing, developed
properties shall be subject to review and approval by the Plan Commission in
accordance with the procedures defined in §
16-8-4(A)(4).
   (C)   New or replacement wall signs placed on existing, developed properties
must meet the purpose and intent of the corridor regulations, as determined by
the Community Development Director, or his or her designee and review by the
Plan Commission shall not be required; however, the applicant may appeal the
decision of the Community Development Director in accordance with §
16-8-3(A)(2).
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-6-3 CALCULATING DIMENSIONS (SEE FIGURE 16-6-3).
   (A)   Sign area. Unless otherwise defined, sign area is determined by the
total area enclosed by a continuous perimeter along the edges of a sign,
including any frame or border. The area of a sign composed of individually-
affixed letters is determined by the total area of the smallest geometric shape
enclosing the letters. A maximum of two geometric shapes may be utilized. The
calculation for a double-faced sign shall be the area of one face only, but
must be the area of the largest side if the two sides are different.
   (B)   Sign height. Sign height is determined by the total distance between
the highest point on a sign to the crown of the street directly opposite the
sign, or from the natural grade level directly below the sign, whichever is
higher.

§ 16-6-10 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   All permanent signs which are in existence at the time of passage of
this article, but which do not conform to one or more provisions of this
article, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be continued
only as provided in this article.
   (B)   Any sign for which a permit has been lawfully granted prior to the
effective date of this or any subsequent amendment of the sign code and which
does not comply with the provisions of such amendment may nonetheless be
completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided construction of the
sign is started within 90 days after the passage of the ordinance amendment,
and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
   (C)   Whenever a nonconforming sign has been discontinued for a period of
six consecutive months, or whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part
of the owner to abandon a nonconforming sign, such sign shall not, after being
discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished, and the sign thereafter shall be
in conformity with the regulations of this code.
   (D)   Normal maintenance of a nonconforming sign is permitted, including
necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend
or intensify the nonconforming features of the sign.
   (E)   No structural alteration, enlargement or extension shall be made in a
nonconforming sign, except in the following situations:
      (1)   When the alteration is required by law; and/or
      (2)   When the alteration will actually result in eliminating the
nonconforming use.
   (F)   If a nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the
extent of 50% or more of its replacement value at that time, the sign can be
rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming use and in compliance with the
provisions of the code. In the event the damage or destruction is less than 50%
of its replacement value, based upon prevailing costs, the sign may then be
restored to its original condition and the use may be continued which existed
at the time of such partial destruction until the nonconforming sign is
otherwise abated by the provisions of this code. In either event, restoration
or repair must be started within a period of six months from the date of damage
or destruction, and diligently prosecuted to completion.
   (G)   Existing temporary signs shall expire at the termination date
specified on the permit, but in no case later than six months from the date of
passage of this amendment. New temporary signs shall be allowed only in
conformance with the provisions contained in
Article 16-8 of this UDO.
   (H)   The Community Development Director shall, after the adoption of this
sign code, notify each owner of a nonconforming sign of the manner in which
such sign is not in compliance with this code. He or she shall further notify
each owner of a nonconforming sign that such sign must either be brought into
compliance with this code or removed prior to its required abatement date.
   (I)   Conformity of sign setbacks reduced by the exercise of eminent domain.
Legal, permitted signs which do not meet the requirements of the minimum
setback which conformed to the provisions of this article but were reduced in
setback as a result of the exercise of eminent domain or the threat of the
exercise of eminent domain by a governmental body and which are still located
entirely upon private property and not in the 25 foot sight triangle shall not
be found to be nonconforming with the provisions of this article as a result of
the loss of such territory.

§ 16-7-1 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the regulations, standards, and criteria contained in this
article is to provide an alternate zoning procedure under which land can be
developed or redeveloped with innovation, imagination, and creative
architectural and site design when sufficiently justified under the provisions
of this article. The objective of the planned development is to encourage a
higher level of design and amenity than is possible to achieve under otherwise
applicable zoning regulations. The end result can be a product which fulfills
the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and planning policies of the village
while departing from the strict application of the use and bulk regulations as
detailed in
Article 16-3 of the UDO. The planned development is intended to permit and
encourage such flexibility and to accomplish the following purposes:
   (A)   To stimulate creative approaches to the commercial, residential, and
mixed-use development of land.
   (B)   To provide more efficient use of land.
   (C)   To preserve natural features and provide open space areas and
recreation areas in excess of that required under conventional zoning
regulations.
   (D)   To develop new approaches to the living environment through variety in
type, design and layout of buildings, transportation systems, and public
facilities.
   (E)   To unify buildings, structures, and site amenities through design.
   (F)   To promote long-term planning pursuant to the Village of Carol Stream
Comprehensive Plan, which will allow harmonious and compatible land uses or
combination of uses with surrounding areas.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-7-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The following must be approved as a planned development in accordance
with the Unified Development Ordinance:
      (1)   Any mixed-use development.
      (2)   Any development in the B-1 District.
   (B)   Any development other than single-unit detached residential uses may
be approved as a planned development.
   (C)   Each planned development should be presented and judged on its own
merits. It shall not be sufficient to base justification for approval of a
planned development solely upon an already existing planned development except
to the extent such planned development has been approved as part of a
development master plan.
   (D)   The burden of providing evidence and persuasion that any planned
development is necessary and desirable shall rest with the applicant.
   (E)   Uses within a planned development shall be as permitted within the
zoning district in which the planned development is located, with the following
exceptions:
      (1)   Planned developments in the O-S District shall also be entitled to
the uses of the B-2 District.
      (2)   Planned developments in the I District shall also be entitled to
the uses of the B-3 District.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-7-3 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW.
   Approval of development through the use of a planned development, including
modifications to conventional zoning and subdivision regulations, is a
privilege and will be considered by the village only in direct response to the
accrual of tangible benefits from the planned development to the village or the
neighborhood in which it would be located. These benefits shall be in the form
of exceptional amenities, outstanding environmental, landscape, architectural
or site design, or the conservation of special man-made or natural features of
the site. In reviewing an application for a planned development, the Plan
Commission and/or Village Board, as the case may be, shall be required to make
certain findings based on the following standards:
   (A)   Required findings. No application for a planned development shall be
approved unless all the following findings are made about the proposal:
      (1)   Comprehensive plan. The planned development shall conform with the
general planning policies of the village as set forth in the Comprehensive
Plan.
      (2)   Public welfare. The planned development shall be designed, located,
and proposed to be operated and maintained such that it will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property and will not
substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public
health, safety, and welfare.
      (3)   Impact on other property. The planned development shall not be
injurious to the use or enjoyment of other property in the neighborhood for the
purposes permitted in the district, shall not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of surrounding properties for uses permitted in the
zoning district, shall not be inconsistent with the community character of the
neighborhood, shall not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and
shall be consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the
Comprehensive Plan, and shall not substantially diminish or impair property
values within the neighborhood, or be incompatible with other property in the
immediate vicinity.
      (4)   Impact on public facilities and resources. The planned development
shall be designed such that adequate utilities, road access, drainage, and
other necessary facilities will be provided to serve it. The planned
development shall include such impact donations as required by this UDO.
      (5)   Archaeological, historical or cultural impact. The planned
development shall not substantially adversely impact a known archaeological,
historical, or cultural resource located on or off the parcel(s) proposed for
development.
      (6)   Parking and traffic. The planned development shall have or make
adequate provision to provide necessary parking and ingress and egress to the
proposed use in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion in the public
streets and provides adequate access for emergency vehicles.
      (7)   Adequate buffering. The planned development shall have adequate
landscaping, public open space, and other buffering features to protect uses
within the development and surrounding properties.
      (8)   Performance. The applicant shall demonstrate a successful history
of having completed one or more recent projects of comparable value and
complexity to provide the village with reasonable assurance that, if
authorized, the planned development can be completed according to schedule as
proposed.
      (9)   Signs. Any sign on the site of the planned development shall be in
conformity with or shall satisfy the standards of review for variations as
detailed in
Article 16-8 of the UDO.
   (B)   Modification standards. In addition to the findings required above,
the following standards shall be utilized in considering applications for
modifications of the conventional zoning and subdivision regulations for a
planned development. These standards shall not be regarded as inflexible but
shall be used as a framework by the village to evaluate the quality of the
amenities, benefits to the community, and design and desirability of the
proposal.
      (1)   Integrated design. A planned development shall be laid out and
developed as a unit in accordance with an integrated overall design. This
design shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient, and harmonious grouping
of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of space
inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features.
      (2)   Beneficial common open space. Any common open space in the planned
development shall be integrated into the overall design. Such spaces shall have
a direct functional or visual relationship to the main building(s) and not be
of isolated or leftover character. The following would not be considered usable
common open space:
         (a)   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual
tenant or owner.
         (b)   Dedicated streets, alleys, and other public rights-of-way.
         (c)   Vehicular drives and parking, loading and storage areas.
         (d)   Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land.
         (e)   Land areas needed to provide required buffer yards as set forth
in
Article 5 of the Unified Development Ordinance.
      (3)   Location of taller buildings. Taller buildings shall be located
within the planned development in such a way as to dissipate any material
adverse impact on lower buildings within the development or on surrounding
properties, and shall not unreasonably invade the privacy of occupants of such
lower buildings.
      (4)   Functional and mechanical features. Exposed storage areas, refuse
and recycling facilities, exposed machinery installations, service areas, truck
loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas
and structures shall be included in the design of the planned development and
made as unobtrusive as possible. They shall be subject to such setbacks,
special planting or other screening methods as shall reasonably be required to
prevent their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment
and the surrounding properties.
      (5)   Visual and acoustical privacy. The planned development shall
provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for each dwelling unit or
tenant space. Fences, walls, barriers, and landscaping shall be used as
appropriate for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the
privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable view or uses, and
reduction of noises.
      (6)   Energy efficient design. A planned development shall be designed
with consideration given to various methods of site design and building
location, architectural design of individual structures, and landscaping design
capable of reducing energy consumption within the planned development.
      (7)   Landscape conservation and visual enhancement. The existing
landscape and trees in a planned development shall be conserved and enhanced,
as feasible, by minimizing tree and soil removal, and the conservation of
special landscape features such as streams, ponds, groves, and land forms. The
addition or use of larger trees, shrubs, flowers, fountains, ponds, special
paving amenities will be encouraged to the extent of their appropriateness and
usefulness to the planned development and the likelihood of their continued
maintenance.
      (8)   Drives, parking and circulation. Principal vehicular access shall
be from dedicated public streets, and access points shall be designed to
encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum
hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. With respect to vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking,
special attention shall be given to location and limiting the number of access
points to the public streets through the use of cross access connections, width
of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation
of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, adequate provision for service by
emergency vehicles, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and
convenient, and insofar as feasible, do not detract from the design of proposed
buildings and structures and the neighboring properties.
      (9)   Surface water drainage. Special attention shall be given to proper
site surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not adversely
impact neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. Surface
water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it will not
obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.

development and redevelopment within the Gary Avenue Corridor and North Avenue
Corridor Overlay Districts strive toward the highest level of quality in both
design and construction. Nothing in these provisions is intended to stifle
creativity or artistic expression nor is anything in these provisions intended
to impede the economic use of land. Rather, the provisions are intended to
challenge design professionals to create extraordinary sites and buildings
within a context that is unique to the village. The criteria, by which all new
development and redevelopment in the Overlay Districts shall be reviewed is as
follows:
         (a)   Consistency with all provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and

height; site furnishings (lighting, outdoor seating, signs and the like);
landscaping (retention of natural vegetation, plant selection and placement,
retention and incorporation of water features, and the like); and other visible
outdoor site elements;
         (e)   Creation of a suitable balance between the amount and
arrangement of open space, landscaping and view protection on the one hand and
the design and function of human-made features on the other. Achieving this
balance should consider screening, buffering, size and orientation of open
spaces, personal and property security, and localized wind and solar effects;
         (f)   Provision of safe and adequate access to and from the site,
giving ample consideration to the location and number of access points from
public streets, the safety and convenience of merging and turning movements,
and traffic management and mitigation; and

specific instances hereinafter set forth where the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall have made a finding of fact based upon the standards hereinafter
prescribed that there are practical difficulties or particular hardships in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   Application. An application for a variation shall be submitted to
the Community Development Director, along with such accompanying material as is
required to ensure compliance with the variation review criteria below.

      (5)   Variation review criteria. A variation may be granted by the
Village Board upon an affirmative finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that
all of the following conditions exist:
         (a)   The requested variation arises from conditions that are unique
to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning
district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action;
         (b)   That the variation to be granted will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood in which the subject property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair use or development of adjacent property;
         (c)   The strict application of the applicable standards will
constitute an unnecessary physical hardship (not economic hardship) because the
property cannot be used for an otherwise allowed use without coming into
conflict with applicable site development standards;
         (d)   The variation is the minimum action necessary to alleviate the
hardship and observes the spirit of this UDO; and
         (e)   The variation desired will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, or general welfare or impair the purposes or intent of this UDO
or the comprehensive plan.

Article 6 : Sign Standards may be granted by the Village Board upon an
affirmative finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that all of the following
conditions exist:
         (a)   The inability to follow the strict standards of the sign code
are due to the unique physical feature of the property;
         (b)   The available locations for adequate signing on the property;
         (c)   The effect of the proposed sign on pedestrian and motor traffic;
         (d)   The proposed variation will not impair visibility to the
adjacent property, create or increase traffic problems, endanger public safety
or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other
property or improvements in the area;
         (e)   The cost to the applicant of complying with the sign code as
opposed to the detriment; and
         (f)   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent
of this article.
      (7)   Fence variation review criteria. 
         (a)   An exceptional situation related to topography, surroundings or
conditions of a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional
narrowness or shallowness;
         (b)   Difficulties or particular hardship in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of the fence standards;
         (c)   The fence will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property;
         (d)   The fence will not endanger the public safety;
         (e)   The fence will not unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area; and
         (f)   The fence will not impair the public health, safety, comfort,
morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the village.
      (8)   Findings of fact. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall make a
determination on each of the variation review criteria and submit its findings
in the form of a written report to the Village Board. Findings of fact shall be
based on evidence presented at the public hearing on the variation request. A
negative finding of fact on any of the variation review criteria shall require
a negative vote on the application as a whole.
      (9)   Conditions of approval. The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend
and the Village Board may require such conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect
of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to implement the
general purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (10)   Expiration and lapse of approval. The applicant shall have 12
months from the date of approval of a variation to secure any necessary permits
to carry out the proposed improvements. If permits have not been obtained
within 12 months of the date of variation approval, the approved variation
shall lapse.

uses properly with other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be
reviewed and authorized or denied according to the following procedure.
      (2)   Application. An application for a special use permit shall contain
all of the required elements of site plan review as detailed in §
16-8-3(F), and shall include a detailed written description of the operation
and nature of the proposed special use. Site plan review shall occur
concurrently with special use permit review. Application procedures are
described in the general application provisions found in §
16-8-2 and include published and mailed notification requirements of §
16-8-4(F)(2)(a) and (b).
      (3)   Special use permit review criteria. A special use permit may be
recommended by the Plan Commission and granted by the Village Board only upon
finding in the review of the application that all of the following criteria are
met. No special use shall be recommended by the Plan Commission, nor approved
by the Village Board, unless the special use:
         (a)   Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at the location;
         (b)   Will not be unreasonably detrimental to or endanger the public
health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare;
         (c)   Will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property
in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially
diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;

      (4)   Hearing and recommendation by the Plan Commission. The Plan
Commission shall make a determination on each of the special use permit review
criteria and submit its findings in the form of a written report to the Village
Board. Findings of fact shall be based on evidence presented at the public
hearing on the special use permit request. A negative finding of fact on any of
the six special use permit review criteria shall require a negative vote on the
application as a whole. The Plan Commission may recommend certain conditions
and restrictions, including, but not limited to, those upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance
with the standards and requirements specified herein, or as may be from time to
time required.
      (5)   Action by the Village Board. Prior to granting any special use
permit, the Village Board may stipulate certain conditions and restrictions,
including, but not limited to, those upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed necessary
for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the
standards and requirements specified herein, or as may be from time to time
required. In all cases in which special use permits are granted, the Village
Board shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as
proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and
will be complied with, including, but not limited to, the acceptance in writing
of the owner of the property involved and other interested parties of the
conditions and guarantees set forth within the UDO. A copy of the ordinance
bearing the acceptance may be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of
DuPage County. The acceptance shall be in approximately the following form:
         (a)   "The undersigned, being the (owner, tenant, contract purchaser,
etc.) of the property legally described in this ordinance do/does hereby
acknowledge that the fulfillment of such conditions and guarantees are
essential to the granting and continuation of the special use allowed herein,
and that but for the imposition of these requirements and guarantees the
special use would not have been granted. The undersigned do/does further
certify and agree that such conditions and guarantees shall equally bind and be
effective against any/all successor/ successors to the interest of the
undersigned. The commitment herein made shall run with the land and shall be
enforceable by the Village of Carol Stream in a court of law or equity in
addition to any and all other remedies available to the village to secure
compliance with the conditions and guarantees agreed to herein."
      (6)   Expiration and lapse of approval. The applicant shall have 12
months from the date of Village Board approval of a special use permit to
secure any necessary permits to carry out the proposed improvements. If permits
have not been obtained within 12 months of the date of approval, the approval
shall lapse. An extension of the time requirements may be granted by the
Village Board, at the Board's sole discretion, for good cause shown by the
applicant, provided a written request is filed with the village at least four
weeks prior to the respective deadline.
      (7)   Successive applications. If an application is not approved, an
application for the same use on the same property shall not be filed for a
period of 12 months from the date of Village Board action, except upon
demonstration of significant/substantive changes that address the factors
leading to previous denial.
      (8)   Amendments to special use permits. Any change which would alter the
provisions, conditions, or restrictions of a special use ordinance or that
would alter the way the use is operated, designated, maintained, or occupied;
or significantly alters the building size or integral changes to the design or
location of site elements, shall require the applicant or owner to apply for an
amendment to the special use permit. The criteria for amendment for an
amendment to a special use permit shall be the same as for the issuance of a
special use permit.

         (d)   Security posted with the village may, upon completion of
specific public improvements but prior to final acceptance of all public
improvements, be reduced, from time to time, upon recommendation of the
Engineering Services Director and approval of the Village Board, so long as the
security remaining shall be in an amount equal to 110% of the estimated value
of the uncompleted work plus 10% of the estimated cost of the completed work,
as determined by the Engineering Services Director. Upon final acceptance of
such public improvements as provided herein and the posting of a maintenance
security for the completed and accepted public improvements, such completion
security shall be fully released.
         (e)   In the event that any time prior to the final acceptance of the
public improvements, the amount of the security remaining unused by the village
as cash or not drawn down under the irrevocable letter of credit, or no longer
available through the surety, should not be adequate to cause the completion of
the uncompleted public improvements, the village may upon seven days' written
notice require the developer, or the owner of the property which benefits from
the improvements, or their respective successors and/or assigns, to post
additional security in an amount sufficient to cause the completion of the
public improvements. The village may take this action on more than one occasion
if the amount of the security at any time should be inadequate to permit the
completion of public improvements. In the event that there is inadequate
security to complete public improvements, the village shall not issue any
building or occupancy permits.
         (f)   Where the required public improvements have not been installed
within the terms of the performance security, the village may then declare the
developer to be in default and may use the security amount on matters related
to insuring the satisfactory completion of the public improvements.
         (g)   Where the village has caused the completion of public
improvements which have not been adequately completed by the developer or the
owner of the property or their respective successors and assigns, or where the
village accepts maintenance responsibilities for public improvements which have
not been completed or where bills of sale or other documentation has not been
furnished to the village for public improvements associated with the
subdivision, which will be owned by the village, the developer, the owner and
their respective successors or assigns shall remain responsible for the full
obligations contained within the village ordinances associated with the
dedication and improvement of property until all provisions of this code
associated with completion of the public improvements, the transfer of
ownership and maintenance responsibility to the village have been properly
completed.
         (h)   The Engineering Services Director is authorized to waive the
surety requirements of this section for the installation of any public
improvements by a governmental agency, provided that the installation of the
public improvements is for a governmental purpose. The Engineering Services
Director may require the governmental agency to execute an agreement binding
the governmental agency to construct and install the public improvements in
full accordance with village ordinances and all applicable laws, rules and
regulations and to correct any deficiencies in such public improvements, as
determined by the village.
      (8)   Inspection of public improvements. All public land improvements
required under the provisions of this article shall be inspected during the
course of construction by the Engineering Services Director or a duly
designated deputy. During the course of construction of the improvements, the
developer shall notify the Engineering Services Director 24 hours before any
required inspection of said improvements.
      (9)   Acceptance of public improvements.
         (a)   Upon written notification that the developer believes the public
improvements ready for acceptance, the Engineering Services Director, the
design engineer and the contractor shall make an inspection of the completed
work. The Engineering Services Director shall prepare a list of all items not
meeting the requirements of this article (i.e. "punchlist").
         (b)   The developer shall cause all items not meeting the requirements
of this article to be corrected within 60 days of the receipt of such items.
         (c)   Following the completion of all work required by the inspection,
the developer shall submit the following materials (the acceptance documents):
            I.   A certificate of completion, signed by the design engineer,
inspecting engineer and by the developer in the form approved by the village,
certifying that the public improvements have been completed in accordance with
the requirements of this title;
            II.   A title insurance policy, indicating that the public
improvements have been completed, are ready for acceptance by the village, and
are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances;
            III.   A bill of sale, including an Inventory of public
improvements and an exhibit of public improvements, transferring title to all
public improvements to the village; and
            IV.   Maintenance security as required by division (O)(10) of this
section.
            V.   One set of as-built plans bearing the signature and seal of
the Illinois registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor who

public improvements shall be made only by the adoption of a resolution by the
Village Board after all the provisions of this section have been met.
      (10)   Maintenance security.
         (a)   At the time of the acceptance of the required public
improvements by the Village Board as provided herein, the developer, or its
successors and/or assigns shall file a maintenance guarantee with the Village
Board in the amount of 10% of the estimated cost of the required public
improvements and in a form satisfactory to the Village Attorney. The guarantee
may be held by the village for a period of 18 months after acceptance of the
public improvements for the purpose of:
            I.   Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in
material or workmanship furnished for any public improvements; and
            II.   Guaranteeing against any damage to the public improvements by
reason of the settling of ground, base or foundation thereof.
         (b)   The maintenance guarantee shall provide that, if the defects
have so developed and have not been corrected by developer or its successors or
assigns, then the guarantee may be applied by the village to correct such
defects.
         (c)   If the date of acceptance of the public improvements results in
the 18 month maintenance period ending between November 1st and April 30th, the
maintenance guarantee shall be extended to the following May 1st.
      (11)   Design standards and construction specifications. The Engineering
Services Director maintains and may amend from time to time, standards and
specifications for the design, installation, and construction of public and
private improvements. Such standards and specifications shall be compiled into
a manual titled "Manual of Design Standards and Construction Specifications "
(DSCS). The design and construction of all required land improvements, whether
intended to remain privately-owned or dedicated to the village (i.e. public),
shall comply with the requirements established in the version of the DSCS
Manual in effect at the time of the developer's application for the final plat
of subdivision.
   (P)   Annexation (See
Figure 16-8-4(P)).
      (1)   Applicability. Annexation of unincorporated land to the village
shall require review and approval by the Village Board. The following procedure
is established to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare through the
provision of further growth and expansion of the community through sound
annexation and good planning practices.
      (2)   Application. An application for annexation shall be submitted to
the Community Development Director, along with the following information:
         (a)   Plat of survey with legal description for all parcels within the
land proposed to be annexed, depicting the location of all structures and

         (e)   Proof of property ownership or consent letter from the property
owner.
         (f)   Annexation agreement, if required.
      (3)   Annexation review criteria. The Village Board shall have the sole
discretion to approve or disapprove applications seeking the annexation of land
to the village.
      (4)   Annexation fees. In addition to the fees for processing an
application for annexation and, if applicable, an annexation agreement, as set
forth in
Chapter 6, Article 13 of the Village Code of Ordinances, a per acre annexation
fee established by the Village Fee Schedule shall be due and paid to the
village prior to the recordation of the ordinance annexing the property.
      (5)   Annexation ordinance.
         (a)   Each annexation ordinance shall contain a clause making the
payment of annexation fees a binding obligation upon the successors in title of
the person requesting the annexation.
         (b)   The annexation ordinance shall be recorded by the Village Clerk
in the office of the DuPage County Recorder of Deeds, thereby making the
obligations under the ordinance a matter of public record to any successors in
title of the owner at the time the property is annexed.
         (c)   The Village Clerk shall also file a certified copy of the
annexation ordinance with the following:
            I.   DuPage County Clerk;
            II.   DuPage County Board of Election Commissioners;

            VII.   Illinois Department of Revenue.
      (6)   No construction or improvements shall be made on any property
annexed until payment in full shall be made of all annexation fees. Nothing
herein contained shall be construed as compelling the village to make any
extension or improvements or to expend any monies for such purpose in relation
to the annexation.
      (7)   Extension of annexation agreements. Where land has been annexed to
the village pursuant to an annexation agreement, and at least five years of
that agreement have expired, and the village and the owner have concluded that
it is desirable to extend the terms of that agreement beyond the period
established by statute, the village and the owner may, utilizing the procedures
established by state law for the extension of an annexation agreement, extended
the terms of the agreement for up to an additional period of 20 years. The
village intends to fully exercise its home rule powers through the passage of
this division and finds that it will benefit the citizens of the community and
will assist in the appropriate planning and development of the village to
provide an option for property owners and the corporate authorities of the
village to mutually benefit from the terms of an extended annexation agreement.

(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-9-12 LAND AND CASH DONATIONS.
   (A)   Donations required. Unless otherwise provided for in an annexation
agreement with the village, as a condition of approval of a final plat of
subdivision or of a final plat of a planned development, each subdivider or
developer shall be required to dedicate land and/or make cash contributions in
lieu of land for acquisition of park and school sites; and cash donations for
school construction, fire protection, village services, books and library
services, and recreation to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the subdivision or planned development as herein-after set forth.
   (B)   Donations required from properties outside village corporate limits.
      (1)   In the event that land which is subject to subdivision approval by
the village is not within the corporate limits of the village at the time of
approval of a final plat of subdivision for the land, the provisions of this
article shall not apply to such land with respect to contributions for village
library services or in any other instance where the land is not within the
jurisdiction of the governmental entity to which the contribution or donation
is to be made.
      (2)   However, in the event that land which is subject to subdivision
approval by the village is not within the corporate limits of the village at
the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision for the land, the governing
body of any governmental entity which would be entitled to land and/or cash
donations pursuant to this article may request that the village vary the terms
of this article by allowing such governmental entity to make its own agreement
and/or waiver as to any or all of the donations and amounts thereof required in
this article with the subdivider, developer and/or owner of such land. The
request shall be made in writing by a resolution adopted by the governing board
of such governmental entity. In such an event, the village may, by motion,
condition subdivision approval upon compliance with the provisions of this
article as the provisions of this article have been modified by the variation
and/or waiver.
   (C)   Donations computed on projected population.
      (1)   For purposes of computing the amount of land donations or cash
contributions in lieu of land for park and school sites, and cash donations for
school construction, fire protection, village services, books and library
services and recreation that will be required of each subdivision or planned
development to enable the village to provide facilities and services to meet
the needs of such subdivision or planned development, its projected population
density shall be computed in accordance with
16-9-12(F) set forth at the end of this article, which is generally indicative
of current and short range projected trends in family size by age groups.
      (2)   
Table 16-9-12(F) shall be used for all population estimates unless a subdivider
or developer files a written objection to the village data, together with his
or her own demographic study showing the estimated population to be generated
by his or her subdivision or planned development. In that event, the final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be
made by the corporate authorities on the basis of the foregoing village data,
data submitted by the subdivider or developer, and from other sources which may
be submitted to the corporate authorities by the park district, school
districts, fire protection district, public library or others. It is recognized
that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the
years and that
Table 16-9-12(F) is subject to periodic review and amendment, if necessary.
   (D)   Land contribution to school districts. School sites shall be donated
and conveyed to the village in accordance with the following criteria.
      (1)   Number of students. The ultimate number of students that will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned development shall be
determined in accordance with the current (at the time of plan review) edition
of
Table 16-9-12(D)(3): School Site Dedication Requirements.
      (2)   Land donation to school. The amount of land required to be
dedicated shall be determined by dividing the estimated number of children in
each of the school age brackets hereinafter set forth that will be generated by
the proposed subdivision or planned development by the maximum recommended
number of students that can be served in the type of school assigned to such
age bracket, hereinafter set forth, and multiplying the quotient times the
minimum number of acres recommended for a school site, hereinafter set forth.
The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient
land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such
school classification.
      (3)   School classifications and size of school site. School
classifications and size of school sites shall be determined in accordance with
the following criteria*:
 
Table 16-9-12(D)(3): School Site Dedication Requirements
School Classification by Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number of Acres of
Grades                   for Each Such School       Land for Each School Site
                         Classification             of Such Classification
Elementary Schools,      600 students               11 acres
Grades K - 5
Middle Schools, Grades 6 900 students               29 acres
- 8
High Schools, Grades 9 - 2,300 students             53 acres
12
*The residents of the village are served by seven different school districts.
In the event that an affected school district has a different school
classification than as shown in the table above, such school classifications,
size of school sites and minimum acres of land set forth in the table above
shall be modified to meet the requirements of the affected district.
      (4)   Location of school site. The comprehensive plan of the village
shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
      (5)   Improved sites. Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in
accordance with the Unified Development Ordinance and water retention/detention
requirements. All sites shall be conveyed in a condition ready for full service
of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb
and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision
made therefor. The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition
of improved sites may be deferred due to the delay time between conveyance of
any such school sites and construction of school facilities thereon.
      (6)   School land conveyed to the village. School land conveyed to the
village shall be held by it for transfer to the affected school district or
other entity. Any school land conveyed to the village or thereafter transferred
to a school district or other entity pursuant to this article which is not used
for school purposes within 20 years after it is conveyed to the village shall
be reconveyed to the developer.
   (E)   Cash contribution to school districts.
      (1)   In addition to the land donation referred to in §
16-9-12(D), or a cash contribution in lieu of land referred to in §
16-9-12(O), each subdivider or developer shall be required to make a cash
contribution to aid in the provision of necessary funds for the construction,
expansion or rehabilitation of a school for the use of the children who will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned development, or for other
improvements to the extent required in whole or part by the existence of a
school.
      (2)   The amount of the cash donation shall be determined by multiplying
the estimated number of children in the K-12 school age bracket that will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development times $1,000
per child. The contribution required for school construction shall be regularly
updated, pursuant to §
16-9-12(L). Funds contributed by a developer pursuant to this section shall be
deposited with the Village Treasurer to be held in a special fund which shall
not be used for any purpose other than for payment of the cost of school
construction, expansion or rehabilitation or for other improvements to the
extent required in whole or in part by the existence of a school. Any interest
which accrues shall also be used for the purposes set forth in this section.
Any cash donated to the village for school construction or expansion purposes
pursuant to this article which has not been expended for those purposes within
20 years shall be refunded to the developer.
      (3)   The funds and any accrued interest will be apportioned among the
school districts affected by a particular development based on the number of
students estimated to be generated as set forth at the end of this article in
Table 16-9-12(F), or may be expended by the village for construction,
maintenance or replacement of physical structures and facilities owned or
operated by the village to the extent required in whole or in part by the
existence of a school.
      (4)   This cash contribution is a requirement of the village's
Subdivision Code. However, in order not to make this requirement overly onerous
and to assist developers in meeting this financial responsibility, the cash
contributions required in this section shall be payable upon the issuance of
the building permit for each dwelling unit.

NOTES TO TABLE:
There are only three significant categories provided in this chart. Because of
the similarity of yields of all types of attached single family, only one
category is provided. The same is true with apartments, thus only one category.
Because of the short history of some newer types of single units, both detached
and attached individual evaluations may be necessary.
 
   (F)   Contributions; park sites. Park sites shall be donated and conveyed to
the park district in accordance with the following criteria.
      (1)   Number of residents. The ultimate number of residents that will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development shall be
determined in accordance with
Table 16-9-12(F) : Estimated Population per Dwelling Unit. The amount of land
required to be dedicated for park sites in each subdivision or planned unit
development shall be determined by dividing the estimated population of such
subdivision or planned development by 1,000 and multiplying the quotient times
five and one-half acres of park land required for each 1,000 people.
      (2)   Location of park sites.
         (a)   Except for combined school/park sites, as defined in §
16-9-12(J), the comprehensive plan adopted by the village, and the Carol Stream
Park District Master Plan shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. If
the village or the park district has not planned a park within the subdivision
or planned development or the neighborhood in which the subdivision or planned
development is located, the park site shall be so located as to be readily
accessible to the people within such neighborhood. Play and athletic fields and
large park sites must be conveniently accessible to the community at large.
         (b)   Proper ingress, egress and curb cuts shall be provided. For
water areas, provisions must be made for pathway/driveway around these areas
for emergency vehicles and police patrol. Provisions for major use of a
pathway/driveway for bike riding, walkway, jogging trail and pedestrian traffic
shall be made.
      (3)   Environmental quality.
         (a)   Land to be dedicated for park sites shall be approved by the
village according to its environmental quality, as well as its suitability for
active and passive recreational activities. The land is to be dry and usable at
all times and not subject to flooding or used as detention. Should a donation
include a detention/retention area over and above the five and one-half acres
required per 1,000 of ultimate population estimated to be generated by the
development, the park district may accept such additional land. No bogs or
swamps shall be acceptable as required park sites. Lakes and native prairie
wetlands shall not normally be acceptable, but may be approved by the village
where the area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to protect a
significant natural resource. No site that has been part of an unlicensed
landfill or a toxic waste dump shall be acceptable as required park acreage.
         (b)   Every effort shall be made to conserve for public use and
enjoyment those areas of significant natural and environmental value. Except in
those specific areas designated by the village for development as playfields or
other active areas, all trees, other plant materials, streams and other natural
features shall be retained on land to be dedicated for park site use, unless
specifically cited by the village for removal by the developer.
         (c)   Shape. Dedicated park sites shall be regularly configured to
permit efficient park programming, security and maintenance. Sites shall be
rectangular, or nearly rectangular, in shape with no interior angle of the
boundary line less than 60 degrees, unless specifically approved by the
village. Narrow strips of land, small parcels that intrude into adjacent
orderly development, or left over parcels that are oddly shaped or located
shall be avoided.
      (4)   Improvements.
         (a)   Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in accordance
with the village's Subdivision Code and water retention/detention requirements,
except as varied by the specific terms of this article. In addition, in the
event that a park site includes retention/detention areas, slopes must be
mowable and shall not exceed a five to one (5:1) slope. Those areas, where by
necessity and subject to the approval of the Village Engineer, the grade
exceeds five to one (5:1), must have a covering of flagstone or crown vetch
which eliminates the need to mow. All areas must be final graded and seeded to
meet park district specifications as to seed mixture.
         (b)   All sites shall be conveyed in a condition ready for full
service of electrical, water, sewer, and streets (including enclosed drainage
and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable
provision made therefor. In addition, location of hydrants shall be made in
conformance with village requirements. Provision for water for watering
vegetation and flooding for ice skating shall be made where appropriate. Sewers
for possible installation of restrooms or shelters at a later date shall be
provided. Electricity for street lights for future lighting for shelters and
security shall be provided. Security lighting along pathway shall be provided.
   (G)   Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas.
      (1)   When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for
recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a
portion of the park and recreational area in subdivisions or planned
developments may, at the option of the Village Board, be provided in the form
of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of
same shall be determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the
projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land
for the general area.
      (2)   In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated
parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the
installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer
as part of his or her obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including
specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village,
and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or
developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be
permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal
documents.
   (H)   Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan of the
village calls for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites
in a particular proposed subdivision or planned development than the developer
is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution
shall, if so determined by the Village Board, be reserved for subsequent
purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village;
provided that, such acquisition is made within one year from the date of
approval of the final plat.
   (I)   Combining with adjoining developments. Where the subdivision or
planned development is less than 40 acres, public open space or a school site
which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications
from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas or
school sites without hardship on a particular developer.
   (J)   Combined school/park sites. The developer and the village may agree
that the developer shall dedicate and convey land (or contribute cash in lieu
of land pursuant to §
16-9-12(O) for combined school/park sites in lieu of land donations otherwise
required under §
16-9-12(D) and
16-9-12(F) in accordance with the following standards.
      (1)   The amount and quality of land required to be dedicated for park
purposes shall first be determined pursuant to §
16-9-12(F).
      (2)   The amount of land required to be dedicated for school purposes
shall be determined by dividing the estimated number of children in each of the
school age brackets hereinafter set forth that will be generated by the
proposed subdivision or planned development, by the maximum recommended number
of students that can be served in the type of school assigned to such age
bracket, set forth in the following table, and multiplying the quotient times
the minimum number of acres recommended for a school site, within a combined
school/park site, for each school classification hereinafter set forth:*

*The residents of the village are served by seven different school districts.
In the event that an affected school district has a different school
classification than as shown in the table above, such school classifications,
size of school sites and minimum acres of land set forth in the table above
shall be modified to meet the requirements of the affected district.
      (3)   A combined elementary school/park site shall be at least 13 acres
in area, of which six and one-half acres shall be conveyed to the park district
and the remaining six and one-half acres shall be held by the village for
transfer to the affected school district or other entity.
      (4)   A combined middle school/park site shall be at least 17 acres in
area, of which eight and one-half acres shall be conveyed to the park district
and the remaining eight and one-half acres shall be held by the village for
transfer to the affected school district or other entity.
      (5)   A combined high school/park site shall be at least 55 acres in
area, of which 22.5 acres shall be conveyed to the park district and the
remaining 22.5 acres shall be held by the village for transfer to the affected
school district or other entity.
      (6)   The standards set forth in §
16-9-12(D),
16-9-12(F), and
16-9-12(N) as to location, improvements and topography shall be applicable to
combined school/park sites.
   (K)   Distribution of plans and plats. Copies of each subdivision plat or
planned development plan shall be transmitted to the park district and the
affected school districts for their written recommendations at the same time
that they are transmitted to the Plan Commission, but nothing herein contained
shall be construed as requiring receipt of a recommendation prior to action by
the corporate authorities of the village.
   (L)   Time of conveyance of donations. All land donations required pursuant
to this article shall be conveyed no later than the earlier of the following to
occur:
      (1)   Within 180 days after a written demand by the village; and
      (2)   The fourth anniversary of the approval of the plat of subdivision
or planned development by the village.
   (M)   Title insurance, survey, assessment plats. Each deed or other
instrument conveying land to the village or the Park District shall be
accompanied by the following:
      (1)   A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do
business in this state to insure that grantee has good merchantable title to
such real estate in an amount equal to its value computed pursuant to §
16-9-12(O)(5), subject only to then current general real estate taxes as of the
date of transfer; covenants, conditions and restrictions which do not prohibit
the use of the subject real estate for school or park use; utility easements
located within 20 feet of the boundary lines of the subject real estate;
drainage ditches, feeders, laterals and underground pipe or other conduit;
      (2)   A current boundary line survey, certified to the grantee by a
licensed state land surveyor to be in compliance with the state's Land Survey
Standards; and
      (3)   Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed is a lot
in a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in a
form acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be
conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number for
exemption purposes.
   (N)   Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not
differ greatly from surrounding land.
   (O)   Cash contributions in lieu of land. Criteria for requiring cash
contributions in lieu of land donations.
      (1)   Whenever, in the determination of the village, any subdivision or
planned development is so small that the school or park sites required under
the provisions of §
16-9-12(D),
16-9-12(F) and/or
16-9-12(J) will not be large enough for practical development and maintenance
as school or park sites, or when the available land cannot meet the standards
set forth in §
16-9-12(D) and
16-9-12(F), or is otherwise inappropriate for park or recreational purposes or
for a school site, the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay
a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required.
         (a)   The cash contribution to be paid in lieu of land donations for
school sites shall be held in trust by the village or other public body
designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of a school site
to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or
planned unit development, or for reimbursement to the school district for prior
acquisition of a school site(s) for which bonds or other financing obligations
are outstanding which will serve immediate or future needs of children from
that subdivision or planned unit development, or for the improvement of any
existing school site which predominantly serves such needs, but not for the
construction, repair or rehabilitation of any school building(s) or addition(s)
thereto.
         (b)   All cash donations shall be apportioned among the affected
school districts on a pro rata basis determined by the estimated population to
be generated in the subdivision or planned development as set forth in
Table 16-9-12(F), set forth at the end of this article.
      (2)   The cash contribution to be paid in lieu of land donations for park
and recreational purposes shall be held in trust by the village or other public
body designated by the village solely for the acquisition of park and
recreational land which will be available to serve the immediate or future
needs of the residents of that subdivision or planned unit development or for
the improvement of existing park and recreational lands which predominantly
serve such needs.
      (3)   If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park or
recreational land donations, or school site donations made pursuant to this
article is not expended for the purposes above set forth within 20 years from
the date of its receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer
who made such contribution.
      (4)   Fair market value: The amount of cash contributions in lieu of land
shall be based on the "fair market value" of land in the proposed subdivision
or planned unit development improved as specified in §
16-9-12(D),
16-9-12(F) that otherwise would have been donated for park, recreational and
school sites. The corporate authorities have determined that the present "fair
market value" of such improved land in the surrounding village is $150,000 per
acre. Such figure shall be regularly updated pursuant to this section, and
shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or
developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such written
objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market
value" of such improved land in the area of his or her development or other
evidence thereof and final determination of such "fair market value" per acre
of such improved land shall be made by the corporate authorities based upon
such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other
sources which may be submitted to the corporate authorities by the park
district, school districts or others. It is recognized that population density,
age distribution, land values, the cost of providing park, school and village
services, construction costs and other local conditions change over the years.
Therefore, the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of
fees in lieu thereof, the required contribution for school construction,
police, fire, library and administrative services, and the "fair market value"
of land in and around the village shall be reviewed at least every two years
and amended if necessary.
      (5)   There will be situations in subdivisions or planned developments
when, in the determination of the village, a combination of land donation and
cash contribution in lieu of land is appropriate. These occasions will arise
when:
         (a)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within the
subdivision or planned development falling within the park or school site shall
be conveyed as aforesaid, and cash shall be donated by the developer, and cash
shall be donated in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market
value of the land donated and the fair market value of the land required to be
donated under §
16-9-12(D) and
16-9-12(F);
         (b)   A major part of a local park or recreation site or school site
has already been acquired and only a small amount of land is needed from the
proposed subdivision or planned development to complete the site. The remaining
amount of land shall be donated by the developer, and cash shall be donated in
an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the land
donated and the fair market value of the land required to be donated under §
16-9-12(D) and
16-9-12(F); or
         (c)   Because of the large number of school districts serving the
village, there may be instances where a combination of land donation and cash
contributions in lieu of land will be appropriate, and will be decided on a
case by case basis in accordance with the criteria set forth in this article.
For example, a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as one type of
school site, for example elementary, but that there is no site which is
suitable for a high school site in accordance with the criteria set forth in
this section. In that event, a land donation will be made to the elementary
school district and a cash donation will be made to the high school district.
      (6)   A cash contribution in lieu of land is a requirement of the
village's Subdivision Code. However, in order not to make this requirement
overly onerous and to assist developers in meeting this financial
responsibility, the cash contributions required in this section shall be
prorated and payable upon the issuance of the building permit for each dwelling
unit.
   (P)   Contributions; village services.
      (1)   In order to provide the village with funds to defray the increased
cost of providing village services to developers during the construction
process and residents of new subdivisions before tax revenues are generated by
such new subdivisions or planned developments in the process of construction, a
cash contribution in the amount of $360 per person or fraction thereof shall be
made to the village on the basis of the estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit determined as set forth in
Table 16-9-12(F), set forth at the end of this article. The contribution
required for village services shall be regularly updated pursuant to §
16-9-12(T).
      (2)   This cash contribution is a requirement of the village's
Subdivision Code. However, in order not to make this requirement overly onerous
and to assist developers in meeting this financial responsibility, the cash
contributions required in this section shall be payable upon the issuance of
the building permit for each dwelling unit.
   (Q)   Contributions; additional school services.
      (1)   In the event that an affected school district decides by resolution
at anytime within five years after approval of a plat of subdivision of planned
development that a land donation or cash in lieu of a land donation will not be
required by that particular district within the next five years to accommodate
the number of students projected to be generated by a proposed subdivision or
planned development, but that such projected number of students shall require
the hiring of additional teachers and expansion and creation of new programs,
in order to provide the affected school district with funds to provide such
services before tax revenues are generated by such new subdivision or planned
development, a cash contribution in the amount of $333 per student shall be
made to the village on the basis of the estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit determined pursuant to the table set forth at the end of this
article in
Table 16-9-12(F), and all such funds shall be paid over by the village to the
affected school district. The contribution required for school services shall
be regularly updated pursuant to §
16-9-12(T).
      (2)   All such donations shall be apportioned among the affected school
districts on a pro rata basis determined by the estimated population in the
subdivision or planned development as set forth at the end of this article in
Table 16-9-12(F).
      (3)   This cash contribution is a requirement of the village's
Subdivision Code. However, in order not to make this requirement overly onerous
and to assist developers in meeting this financial responsibility, the cash
contributions required in this section shall be payable upon the issuance of
the building permit for each dwelling unit.
   (R)   Contributions; Fire Protection District. In order to help defray the
cost of providing fire protection for residents of new subdivisions or planned
developments during the construction process, and before tax revenues are
generated by such subdivisions and planned developments in the process of
construction, a cash contribution in the amount of $600 per acre shall be paid
to the village, prior to the recordation of the ordinance annexing the
property. The contribution required for fire services shall be regularly
updated pursuant to §
16-9-12 (T).
   (S)   Contributions; public library. In order to help defray the cost of
providing library services for residents of new subdivisions or planned
developments during the construction process and before tax revenues are
generated by subdivisions and planned developments in the process of
construction, a cash contribution in the amount of $65 per person or fraction
thereof shall be made to the village on the basis of the estimated ultimate
population per dwelling unit determined pursuant to
Table 16-9-12(F) , and all such funds shall be paid over by the village to the
Carol Stream Board of Library Trustees. The contribution required for library
services shall be regularly updated pursuant to §
16-9-12 (T).
   (T)   Updating of required contributions and fair market value. It is
recognized that population density, age distribution, land values, the cost of
providing park, school and village services, construction costs and other local
conditions change over the years. Therefore, the specific formula for the
dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, the required
contribution for school construction, police, fire, library and administrative
services, and the fair market value of land in and around the village shall be
reviewed at least every two years and amended if necessary.
   (U)   Severability. The various provisions of this article are to be
considered as severable and if any part or portion of this article shall be
held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not
affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this article.

ARTICLE 10: NONCONFORMING LOTS, BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES
Section
   
16-10-1   General
   
16-10-2   Nonconforming lots, parcels, or land of record
   
16-10-3   Nonconforming buildings or structures
   
16-10-4   Nonconforming uses
   
16-10-5   Nonconforming parking lots
   
16-10-6   Certification of occupancy for nonconforming uses
§ 16-10-1 GENERAL.
   (A)   Purpose and scope of regulations.
      (1)   Any use of land classified as either a permitted use or special use
prior to the effective date of this article or any subsequent amendment to this
article, which is no longer allowed by this article or any subsequent amendment
to this article as either a permitted or special use in the zoning district in
which it is located, is classified as a nonconforming use.
      (2)   It is the intent of this section to permit nonconforming lots,
buildings, structures, and uses to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their continued use. Nonconforming uses are declared to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.
      (3)   It is further the intent of this section that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded, added to, or increased in intensity.
      (4)   Any use of land or structure which was in violation of a provision
of the Zoning Code, Sign Code, Subdivision Code, or Fence Code of the Village
of Carol Stream in effect at the time of the adoption of this UDO, or
amendments thereto, and which does not conform to the provisions of this UDO,
and/or amendments thereto, shall be considered unlawful and in violation of
this UDO.
   (B)   Authority to continue. Nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses
shall be allowed to continue only in accordance with the regulations of this
article.
   (C)   Determination of nonconforming status. The burden of establishing the
legality of a nonconforming building, structure, or use is the owner's burden,
not the village's.
   (D)   Repairs and maintenance. Repairs and normal maintenance required to
keep nonconforming buildings or structures in a safe condition are permitted,
provided that no alterations may be made except those allowed by this UDO or
required by law or ordinance.
   (E)   Change of tenancy or ownership. Changes of tenancy, ownership or
management of an existing nonconforming building or structure are permitted,
provided that no changes in the nature or character, extent or intensity of
such nonconforming building or structure may occur except those allowed by this
UDO.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-10-2 NONCONFORMING LOTS, PARCELS, OR LAND OF RECORD.
   In any district in which a legal lot, parcel, or land of record exists on
the effective date of adoption of this UDO that does not conform in size or
area to the provisions of this UDO, buildings for the uses permitted in such
district may be erected, as permitted in this UDO, on such lot, provided that
such lot is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership.
   (A)   Lots, parcels or land of record, or portions of planned developments
which do not meet the requirements of minimum lot width and area or minimum
size of required yards which conformed to the provisions of this code, but were
reduced in size as the result of the exercise of eminent domain or the threat
of the exercise of eminent domain by a governmental body and which have not
lost required off-street parking or loading facilities shall not be found to be
nonconforming with the provisions of this UDO as a result of the loss of such
territory.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-10-3 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   Where a building or structure was lawful on the effective date of adoption
of this UDO, but could not be built under the terms of this UDO by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of
the building or structure or its location on the lot, such building or
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (A)   No nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged or altered in a
way which will create a new nonconformity or increase the degree of the
existing nonconformity.
   (B)   Should a nonconforming building or structure be destroyed by any means
to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
UDO. Replacement cost shall be based upon the assessed value or an appraisal
completed within the last two years or the amount for which the structure was
insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction. No nonconforming
building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location
unless every portion of such building or structure and the use thereof is made
to conform to all regulations of the district into which it is moved.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-10-4 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Nonconforming uses. Where a use was lawful on the effective date of
the adoption of this UDO but is no longer permissible under the terms of this
UDO as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it otherwise
remains lawful and subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this UDO.
      (2)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, or expanded to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of
adoption or an amendment of this UDO.
         (a)   If a nonconforming use is discontinued for the time periods in
this section, such discontinuance constitutes prima facie evidence that the
nonconforming use has been abandoned and the nonconforming use must be
terminated. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure must
comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which the structure or
land is located. A period of discontinuance caused by acts of god are not
included in calculating the length of discontinuance or abandonment for this
section.
         (b)   When a nonconforming use is offered for sale, such sale period
is not included in calculating the length of discontinuance for this section so
long as all equipment, building design, and similar use infrastructure is
maintained in working condition during the sale period. However, when land upon
which a nonconforming use is located is offered for sale, but the nonconforming
use is not also offered for sale, such sale constitutes prima facie evidence of
abandonment of the nonconforming use and the period will be included in
calculating the length of discontinuance.
         (c)   The following periods of discontinuance constitute abandonment:
            I.   Nonconforming use within an enclosed structure: Discontinued
or abandoned for 24 months.
            II.   Nonconforming use on a lot, no structures: Six months.
      (3)   Nonconforming use of structure. If a lawful use of a building or
structure, or of building or structure and premises in combination, existed on
the effective date of adoption of this UDO that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this UDO, the lawful use may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: No
existing building or structure devoted to a use not permitted by this UDO in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
      (4)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building or structure that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption or amendment of this UDO, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      (5)   Any building or structure, or building or structure and land in
combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted
use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such
structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (6)   When a nonconforming use of a building or structure, or building or
structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six
consecutive months, the building or structure, or building or structure and
premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance
with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (7)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-10-5 NONCONFORMING PARKING LOTS.
   If a parking lot lawfully existed on the effective date of adoption of this
UDO, but does not comply with the provisions of this UDO, such parking lot
shall be considered a legal nonconforming parking lot and may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, and subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No existing use of the land or structure on the same property as the
nonconforming parking lot shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy an
area of the land or structure greater than 50% of the original land or
structure area without constructing a parking lot in conformance with the
requirements specified in this UDO, including parking lot perimeter and parking
lot interior landscape requirements as detailed in §
16-5-5.
   (B)   No building or structure shall be enlarged, erected, constructed or
reconstructed with such an addition having a floor area greater than 50% of the
original floor area of all buildings and structures on the site, and no major
repairs or renovations shall be made exceeding 50% of the value of the
structure located on the same property as the nonconforming parking lot without
constructing a parking lot in conformance with the requirements specified in
this UDO, including parking lot perimeter and parking lot interior landscape
requirements as detailed in §
16-5-5.
(Ord. 2021-05-15, passed 5-3-2021)
§ 16-10-6 CERTIFICATION OF OCCUPANCY FOR NONCONFORMING USES.
   A certificate of occupancy shall be required for the continuation of all
nonconforming uses of land, buildings, or structures created by the passage of
this UDO. Application for such certificate of occupancy for nonconforming uses
shall be filed with the Community Development Director by the owner or lessee
of the land or building occupied by such nonconforming use within one year from
the effective date of adoption of this UDO. It shall be the duty of the
Community Development Director to issue a certificate of occupancy for a
nonconforming use.
