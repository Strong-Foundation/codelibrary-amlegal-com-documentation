about to be sued with some one or more violations of the same nature of the

cost of suit which may be levied upon and collected out of any property of the
defendant or defendants, not exempt from executions by the laws of the State of
Illinois. But if the constable having such execution shall return thereon that
he cannot find sufficient property of the defendant or defendants, not exempt
from execution, to satisfy such execution, then the said justice shall issue a
capias against the body or bodies of the defendant or defendants, and the
constable shall arrest such person or persons and convey him, her or them to
the jail of the County of Grundy thereto remain forty eight (48) hours, and if

Whenever it shall become necessary to take private property for opening or

property for public use and in case the amount of such compensation cannot be
agreed upon, the police magistrate shall cause the same to be ascertained by a
jury of six (6) disinterested freeholders of said town. All jurors empaneled to
ascertain such damages shall be sworn to that effect. They shall proceed to
examine the property in question and after carefully considering both the
advantages and disadvantages that will probably accrue to the owners thereof by
such taking and the proposed use of such property, they shall within ten (10)
days make out and return their verdict in writing, signed by each of said
jurors, to the police magistrate of said town, assessing to such owner or
owners such damages as they think just. Said police magistrate shall file and
docket such verdict, and shall forthwith cause the president and trustees or
their clerk or attorney and the owner or owners of property, included in such
verdict, to be notified of the contents of the same. The said police magistrate
may at any time within ten (10) days of the filing of such verdict, for good
cause shown set aside such verdict and grant a new inquest of damages. If
either party shall be dissatisfied with the verdict of the second inquest, they
shall be allowed an appeal to the circuit court of the County of Grundy. When
any such verdict, not exceeding the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00), shall
be filed with the police magistrate and entered on his docket, unless set aside
or appealed from, it shall be a judgment against the president and trustees of
said town of Minooka, in favor of such owner, including therein the amount of
damages thereby assessed to him, and in case the sum assessed to any owner,
exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00), the said police magistrate shall on
application of the person entitled thereto, certify to the clerk of the circuit
court of Grundy County a full and complete transcript of the proceedings and
verdict in such case, which shall be filed and recorded by the clerk of the
said court in the same manner as other transcripts from the justice's dockets
and shall from the time of such filing, have all the force and effect in favor
of the person or persons entitled to such damages as a judgment obtained in
said circuit court.
Section 37.
The president and trustees shall require their clerk, and it shall be his duty,
to make and keep a full and faithful record of all their proceedings, by-laws
and ordinances and of the time, place and manner of the publication of such by-
laws and ordinances in a book to be provided for that purpose and such book
purporting to be the record book of the corporation of the said town of
Minooka, shall be received in all courts without further proof as evidence of

and other things pertaining to and concerning the corporation of the town of

of Illinois by the production in such court of the book or books in which the
same are recorded in the manner and form hereinafter provided, to-wit:

committed within said town of Minooka, after the passage of this act, and
before the board of trustees of said town shall have provided by ordinances for

collected in accordance with applicable law. Completion of any required traffic

entered in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the applicable
village ordinance, and that the registered owner or the lessee, as the case may
be, had an opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review as
provided in this chapter, the court shall render judgment in favor of the
village and against the registered owner or the lessee for the amount indicated
in the final determination of parking, standing, or compliance violation, plus
costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same
manner as other judgments for the recovery of money. (Ord. 2011-28, 12-20-2011)

person maintaining a place of business in this state who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser. Any tax required to be collected by this chapter,
and any tax in fact collected, shall constitute a debt owed to the village by
the person delivering the electricity, provided that the person delivering
electricity shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of
electricity the charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and
provided further that if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering
supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax. Persons delivering electricity
shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge
for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be
authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to three percent (3%) of
the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the expense incurred
in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting
the tax and supplying data to the municipality upon request. If the person
delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the
purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the municipality in the
manner prescribed by the municipality. Persons delivering electricity who file
returns pursuant to this chapter shall, at the time of filing such return, pay
the municipality the amount of the tax collected pursuant to this chapter.

SIDEWALK DINING PERMITS
SECTION:
3-19-1: Nuisance Declared
3-19-2: Sidewalk Dining; Permits
3-19-3: Violations and Penalties
3-19-1: NUISANCE DECLARED:
The Corporate Authorities of the Village have determined that it is a public
nuisance for any person or entity to set up an outdoor dining area on any
sidewalk, alley, road, street, or other public right of way owned by the
Village or otherwise under the Village’s jurisdiction, except only when such
outdoor dining area is authorized by a sidewalk dining permit issued pursuant
to this Chapter and operated in full conformance with all requirements hereof.
(Ord. 2024-21, 5-28-2024)
3-19-2: SIDEWALK DINING; PERMITS:
   A.   Business establishments that serve food may use Village sidewalks for
outdoor dining so long as the business establishment fully complies with all
requirements of this Chapter.
   B.   Outdoor dining pursuant to this section shall be conducted in
accordance with the following restrictions, in addition to all other applicable
provisions of this Code:
      1.   Outdoor sidewalk dining shall be allowed only on Village sidewalks
located:
         a.   In front of the business establishment, which includes all
adjacent sidewalks for a corner property; and
         b.   In front of immediate adjacent properties, provided the business
establishment secures the written consent of the owner and all tenant(s) of
such property.
      2.   Outdoor sidewalk dining shall be located entirely on hard,
impermeable surfaces (i.e. concrete, asphalt, or brick materials). No part of
the outdoor dining area, nor any equipment or furniture used in conjunction
therewith, shall be located or stored on any grassy or other soft or permeable
surface.
      3.   Any business establishment engaged in outdoor dining shall
coordinate with neighboring properties as it relates to business deliveries,
garbage collection, and other similar activities.
      4.   Service and consumption of alcoholic liquors in an outdoor dining
area is prohibited unless the business establishment applies for and secures a
Class H (Sidewalk Dining) liquor license from the Village. For the avoidance of
doubt: the fact that a business establishment might possess another Village
liquor license, other than a Class H license, that permits the service and
consumption of alcoholic liquors elsewhere on the business establishment’s
licensed premises does not authorize the service and consumption of alcohol in
any sidewalk dining area.
      5.   No business establishment may operate a sidewalk dining area after
10:00 p.m. on any given night.
      6.   Business establishments shall provide sufficient trash receptacles
for refuse and shall be responsible for removing and disposing of any trash in

kept free from refuse at all times.
      7.   No food preparation shall be allowed outside at any time.
      8.   No Live Entertainment, shall be allowed outside in/on/near sidewalk
dining areas.
      9.   Sidewalk dining shall be conducted in a way that does not interfere
with pedestrian use of Village sidewalks, which shall be kept Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) and Illinois Accessibility Code (IAC) compliant at all
times. All items placed on the sidewalk for the operation of an sidewalk dining
area shall be located to maintain a continuous clear path for passage of
pedestrians and so as not to obstruct ingress and egress from the licensed
establishment or any other establishment.
      10.   The maximum occupancy of a sidewalk dining area shall be determined
in cooperation with local fire and health officials and shall fully address
safety concerns related both to social distancing and to the possibility of
fire.
      11.   Business establishments shall comply with the provisions of the
Smoke Free Illinois Act, 40 ILCS 82/1, et seq.
      12.   Business establishments shall provide the Village with a
certificate of insurance naming the Village as an additional insured prior to
serving engaging in outdoor dining on Village property. Policy limits of
liability insurance shall be not less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence.
      13.   Every outdoor dining area permitted pursuant to this Chapter shall
be enclosed by an outdoor fence, barrier, partition, and/or dividers designed
to clearly show separation between the outdoor dining area and the remainder of
the sidewalk.
      14.   The business establishment operating the outdoor dining area is and
shall be responsible for any and all damage caused to any Village property or
right of way in connection with the establishment, maintenance, and use of the
Village’s sidewalk. This remains true even regardless of whether the damage is
directly caused by the business establishment, one of its employees or agents,
one of its customers or guests, or another member of the public traversing the
sidewalk within or immediately adjacent to the sidewalk dining area. In the
event of any such damage, the Village will repair/replace the damaged property
and bill the business establishment for all associated costs.
   C.   Any applicant that wishes to operate an outdoor dining area shall
submit an application for an Outdoor Dining Permit to the Village Clerk. The
application shall include the following information:

the Applicant); and
      2.   All business addresses of the applicant located within the corporate
boundaries of the Village; and
      3.   Proof of ownership, leasehold, and/or owner’s approval for each
property in front of which an outdoor dining area is proposed; and

proposed location of the outdoor dining area; and
      6.   Any other information that the Village deems necessary.
   D.   The concept plan required by this Section shall show with
particularity:
      1.   All existing lot lines for the property(ies) on and in front of
which the outdoor dining area is proposed; and
      2.   All permanent improvements on and around the property on which the
outdoor dining area is proposed; and
      3.   The particular location in which the Applicant proposes to operate
its outdoor dining area; and

4-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A non-habitable structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT: "An Act in Relation to the Regulation of the Rivers, Lakes and Streams of
the State of Illinois", 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and
will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are
as specified in subsection
4-7-7B of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
4-7-5 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured
home, mobile home or prefabricated building. This term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more
than one hundred eighty (180) days.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross-
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated hydraulically equivalent volume
of storage within the floodplain used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off-site flood water elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of a proposed
change to the Floodway Map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to this
chapter, gives assurances to the property owner that once an appropriate use is
constructed according to permitted plans, the Floodway Map can be changed, as
previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as-built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency will revise base flood elevations, flood
insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective
Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, once the as- built plans
are submitted and approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes
through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DELEGATED COMMUNITY: A community delegated state permitting authority in the
floodway.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on
the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year
frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to
the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in velocities.
         A.   The floodways are designated for on the Countywide Flood
Insurance Rate Maps of Will County, Grundy County, and Kendall County prepared
by FEMA and dated, respectively, February 15, 2019; August 2, 2012; and January
8, 2014. When two (2) floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more restrictive
floodway limit shall prevail.
         B.   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Kendall and
Grundy Counties that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the
Village that may be annexed into the Village are designated for Aux Sable Creek
on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA, and for Kendall
County dated January 8, 2014; and for Grundy County dated August 2, 2012. The
floodways for those parts of unincorporated Will County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village that may be annexed into the
Village are designated for the DuPage River and the I and M Canal in the
Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA and dated February 15,
2019.
         C.   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated
floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:
         A.   Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building
or any addition to a building;
         B.   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
         C.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days in any calendar year. If a
travel trailer or recreational vehicle is on site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days in any calendar year, it must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use;
         D.   Installing utilities, construction of roads, bridges, or similar
projects;
         E.   Demolition of a structure, redevelopment of a site, clearing of
land as an adjunct of construction;
         F.   Construction or erection of levees, walls, fences, dams, or
culverts; channel modification;
         G.   Filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving, drilling, mining

FIRM.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term

NAVD 88: National American Vertical Datum of 1988. NAVD 88 supersedes the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD).
NATURAL: When used in reference to channels means those channels formed by the
existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross section of the
stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some
natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is
reestablished. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural

vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized
characteristics.
PUBLIC BODIES OF WATERS: All open public streams and lakes capable of being
navigated by watercraft, in whole or in part, for commercial uses and purposes,
and all lakes, rivers, and streams which in their natural condition were
capable of being improved and made navigable, or that are connected with or
discharge their waters into navigable lakes or rivers within, or upon the
borders of the State of Illinois, together with all bayous, sloughs,
backwaters, and submerged lands that are open to the main channel or body of
water directly accessible thereto.
PUBLIC FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT: A flood control project which will be operated
and maintained by a public agency to reduce flood damages to existing buildings
and structures which includes a hydrologic and hydraulic study of the existing
and proposed conditions of the watershed. Nothing in this definition shall
preclude the design, engineering, construction or financing, in whole or in
part, of a flood control project by persons or parties who are not public
agencies.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE OR TRAVEL TRAILER: A vehicle which is: built on a single
chassis; four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection; designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by
a light duty truck; and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling
but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.

in any increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any changes to the
dimensions of a structure.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A retention facility stores stormwater runoff
without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for storage of
stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a
flood or storm.
RIVERINE FLOODPLAIN: Any floodplain or SFHA subject to flooding from a river,
creek, intermittent stream, ditch, on- stream lake system or any other
identified channel. This term does not include areas subject to flooding from
lakes, ponding areas, areas of sheet flow, or other areas not subject to
overbank flooding.
RUNOFF: The water derived from melting snow or rain falling on the land
surface, flowing over the surface of the ground or collected in channels or
conduits.
SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water or watercourses.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): See definition of "floodplain".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other
improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a
substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STATEWIDE PERMITS: Statewide permits are offered for pre- approved projects
that are considered minor projects which are permissible per the IDNR/OWR part
3700 rules. A complete listing of the Statewide permits and permit requirements
can be obtained from the IDNR/OWR website.
STRUCTURE: See definition of "building".
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage during a 10-year period equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must
be included in this determination. The term includes repetitive loss buildings.
See definition of "repetitive loss".
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure taking place during a 10-year period in which the
cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started,
or increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%). "Substantial
improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term
includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage,
regardless of the actual work done. The term does not, however, include either:
any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or
local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a "historic
structure" listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois
Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

narrow cross-section to a wide cross- section or vice versa.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance, is presumed to be in violation, until such
time as that documentation is provided. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-2019; amd. Ord.
2019-06, 2-26-2019)
4-7-3: ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:
The Building Officer and Inspector shall be responsible for fulfilling all of
the duties listed in section
4-7-4 of this chapter.
To fulfill those duties, the Building Officer and Inspector first should use
the criteria listed in section
4-7-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined
that the site is located within a floodplain, the Building Officer and
Inspector must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe,
a designated floodway or floodplain on which no floodway has been identified.
If the site is within a flood fringe, the Building Officer and Inspector shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
4-7-6 of this chapter be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Building
Officer and Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section
4-7-7 of this chapter be met. If the site is located within an SFHA or
floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the
Building Officer and Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of
section
4-7-8 of this chapter be met.
In addition, the general requirements of section
4-7-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
4-7-6,
4-7-7, or
4-7-8 of this chapter. The Building Officer and Inspector shall assure that all
subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of section
4-7-10 of this chapter.
If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Building Officer and
Inspector shall review the requirements of section
4-7-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the Building
Officer and Inspector shall complete all notification requirements.
In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this
chapter, the Building Officer and Inspector may take any and all actions as
outlined in section
4-7-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-2019)
4-7-4: DUTIES OF THE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL(S):
The Building Officer and Inspector shall be responsible for the general
administration and enforcement of this chapter which shall include the
following:
   A.   Determining The Floodplain Designation: Check all new development sites
to determine whether they are in a floodplain using criteria listed in section
4-7-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter. If they are in a floodplain,
determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile. If the site is within a flood fringe, the Building Officer and
Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section
4-7-6 of this chapter be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Building
Officer and Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section
4-7-7 of this chapter be met. If the site is located within a floodplain for
which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the Building Officer
and Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section
4-7-8 of this chapter be met.
   B.   Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a
floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted
and which drains more than one square mile, the permit shall be referred to a
PE under the employ or contract of the Village for review to ensure that the
development meets section
4-7-7 or 4-7-8 of this chapter. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall
state in writing that the development meets the requirements of section
4-7-7 of this chapter.
   C.   Dam Safety Requirements: Dams are classified as to their size and their
hazard/damage potential in the event of failure. Permits for dams may be
required from IDNR/OWR. Contact IDNR/OWR to determine if a permit is required.
If a permit is required, a permit application must be made to IDNR/OWR prior to
the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
   D.   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required Federal, State
and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   E.   Plan Review And Permit Issuances: Ensure that all development
activities within the floodplains of the jurisdiction of the Village meet the
requirements of this chapter. Issue a floodplain development permit in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this
community when the development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   F.   Inspection Review: Inspect all development projects before, during and
after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Schedule on an annual basis an
inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection.
   G.   Substantial Damage And Substantial Improvement Determinations:
Establish, in coordination with the Building Officer and Inspector, procedures
for administering and documenting determinations, as outlined below, of
substantial improvement and substantial damage made pursuant to section
4-7-9 of this chapter. Determine the market value or require the applicant to
obtain an appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent
appraiser, of the building or structure before the start of construction of the
proposed work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or
structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any
repairs are made. Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs
of improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building
or structure. Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or substantial damage. Notify the applicant if it is
determined that the work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of
substantial damage and that compliance with the flood resistant construction
requirements of the Village and this chapter is required.
   H.   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain permit files
including: an Elevation Certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or non-residential building subject
to section
4-7-9 of this chapter, and/or; the elevation to which a non- residential
building has been floodproofed, using a Floodproofing Certificate, for all
buildings subject to section
4-7-9 of this chapter.
   I.   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request all permit records, including but not limited to base
flood data, floodplain and designated floodway maps, copies of Federal or State
permit documents, variance documentation, soil compaction records, Conditional
Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Amendment, "as-
built" elevation, floodproofing certificates and elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   J.   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections
4-7-7 and
4-7-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the Village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the
Village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      1.   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      2.   IDNR/OWR projects, dams and all other State, Federal or local unit
of government projects, including projects of the Village, except for those
projects meeting the requirements of section
4-7-7 of this chapter;
      3.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per section
4-7-7 of this chapter;
      4.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to section
4-7-7 of this chapter;
      5.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage as indicated in section
4-7-7 of this chapter;
      6.   Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly
navigable rivers, lakes and streams;
      7.   Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles.
   K.   Cooperation With Other Agencies: Cooperate with State and Federal
floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency
flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a regulatory map
within six (6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the
base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map; submit
reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program; and notify FEMA
of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
   L.   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter changes.
   M.   Variances: If a variance is to be granted, the Building Officer and
Inspector shall review the requirements of section
4-7-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the Building
Officer and Inspector shall complete all notifications requirements.
   N.   Enforcement: In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as
required in this chapter, the Building Officer and Inspector may take any and
all actions as outlined in section

4-7-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for
Will, Grundy, and Kendall Counties. If a base flood elevation or 100-year
frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the
protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in
Federal, State or other sources. When a party disagrees with the best available
data, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace
existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review
and consideration prior to any development of the site.
   A.   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of the DuPage River shall
be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study
prepared by FEMA for Will, Grundy, and Kendall County and dated, respectively,
February 15, 2019; August 2, 2012; and January 8, 2014, and such amendments to
such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   B.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Will County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the
Village shall be delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood
insurance study of Will County prepared by FEMA and dated February 15, 2019,
and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Grundy County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the
Village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood
insurance study of Grundy County prepared by FEMA and dated August 2, 2012, and
such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Kendall County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the
Village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood
insurance study of Kendall County prepared by FEMA and dated January 8, 2014,
and such other amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be
prepared from time to time.
   C.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
floodplain delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or
depth) delineated on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Will, Grundy,
and Kendall Counties.
   D.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining floodplains delineated as an "A Zone" on the Countywide Flood
Insurance Rate Map of Will, Grundy, and Kendall Counties shall be according to
the best existing data available from Federal, State or other sources. Should
no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to
determine base flood elevations. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a
riverine floodplain shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II,
HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic
models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-
20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the
United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. (Ord.

4-7-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation and compensatory storage and other provisions of this chapter
are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section
4-7-9 of this chapter.
   A.   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by State law shall commence any development in the floodplain
without first obtaining a development permit from the Building Officer and
Inspector.
      1.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Building Officer and Inspector. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions and legal description for the property, and sealed by a licensed
engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations using the NAVD
of 1988 and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the
location and dimensions of buildings and additions to buildings. For all
proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and
lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development
will be subject to the requirements of section
4-7-9 of this chapter.
      2.   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Building
Officer and Inspector shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can
be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's
first Flood Insurance Rate Map without a permit, as required by this chapter,
is not in the floodplain and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of
this chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the
base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current
Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter. The
Building Officer and Inspector shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate
Map identification.
      3.   The Building Officer and Inspector shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other Federal, State, and local
permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity.
The Building Officer and Inspector shall not issue a permit unless all other
Federal, State, and local permits have been obtained.
      4.   A development permit or approval shall become invalid unless the
start of construction, for work authorized by such permit, is commenced within
one hundred eighty (180) days after its issuance, or if the work authorized is
suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the
work commences. Extensions for periods of not more than one hundred eighty
(180) days each shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause shall be
demonstrated.
   B.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      1.   Elevation Of Site: If fill is being used to elevate the site above
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data and obtain a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA for
the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      2.   Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and five-
tenths (1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below
the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-
year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
   C.   Construction Of A Building Under A LOMR Based On Fill: A person who has
obtained a Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill that removes a site in the
floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply
for a permit from the Village to construct the lowest floor of a building below
the BFE in the floodplain. The Building Officer and Inspector shall not issue
such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth
in the following subsection and maintain the documentation verifying such
compliance.
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection B2 of this
section.
      2.   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
      3.   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the
FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the Building Officer and Inspector may waive the ten foot (10') minimum
setback if an Illinois licensed PE certifies that an alternative method to
protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The
certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design
analysis, which shall be submitted to the Building Officer and Inspector for
review. The Building Officer and Inspector may require such additional
documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance
will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance
be less than four feet (4').
      4.   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained,
the Building Officer and Inspector may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum
setback distance if an Illinois licensed PE certifies that an alternative
method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have
been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a
shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding,
shall be submitted to the Village for review. In no case shall the setback
distance be less than four feet (4').
      5.   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under
the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.
      6.   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the
same direction.
      7.   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois licensed PE, as warranted by the site conditions.
      8.   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five feet (5') below the BFE.
      9.   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and
minimum of one-quarter (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4)
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      10.   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      11.   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
      12.   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the Building Officer and
Inspector may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the
applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines
and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably
safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is
reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed
engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered
basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA
Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an
Illinois licensed PE.
      13.   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural
grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation,
if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-
2019)
4-7-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:
This section applies to proposed development, redevelopment, site modification
or building modification within a designated floodway. The designated floodway

Building Officer and Inspector shall not issue the development permit unless
all required Federal and State permits have been obtained. A registered
professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the Village shall review
and approve applications reviewed under this section.
   B.   Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses:
      1.   Floodway Development: The only development in a floodway which will
be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood
elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not
include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to
accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including
landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials
except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The approved
appropriate uses are as follows:
         a.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
         b.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
         c.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
         d.   Underground and overhead utilities;
         e.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including
open air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block
flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         f.   Detached garages, storage sheds or other non-habitable accessory
structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block
flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage;
         g.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
         h.   Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of
flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot) and
aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation;
         i.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events;
         j.   Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slope toward a watercourse;
         k.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure;
         l.   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation;
         m.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      2.   Appropriate Use: Appropriate uses do not include the construction or
placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts,
excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-
appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically
defined above as an appropriate use. Within the designated floodway, the
construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided
that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a licensed PE and provided that any structure meets the protection
requirements of section
4-7-9 of this chapter:
         a.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood
Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            (1)   Designated floodway conveyance,
 
`K' = 1.486 AR2/3
      n
 
      where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the
cross section and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See
Open Channel Hydraulics, VenTe Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.)
            (2)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a Federal,
State or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
            (3)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
            (A)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
            (B)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
            (C)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction,
a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of
stream length shall be used.
            (D)   Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            (E)   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
         b.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and five-tenths
(1.5) times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage
lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to
be replaced. The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the existing 10-year flood elevation.
All designated flood elevation storage lost above the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no
reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification,
unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
         c.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts
or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in
the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage, for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case
of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
         d.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches: The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1') when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event, or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase
upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1'), the developer must
contact IDNR/OWR, Dam Safety Section for a dam safety permit or waiver.
            (1)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
4-7-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly
accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
            (2)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection
B2b of this section.
            (3)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection B2c of
this section.
            (4)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used
for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
            (5)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by
subsection B of this section.
            (6)   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per subsection B2h of this section.
         e.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And
Approach Roads:
            (1)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed within no more than one- tenth foot (0.1')
increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies
up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a
source of flood damage.
            (2)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            (3)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         f.   On-Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to
the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as
defined in section
4-7-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm.
Code part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity
involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
            (1)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention.
            (2)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning.
            (3)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation
basin.
            (4)   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.
            (5)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         g.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
         h.   Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for
lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency:
            (1)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
            (2)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length; and
            (3)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction,
a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of
stream length shall be used.
            (4)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         i.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
            (1)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat.
            (2)   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values.
            (3)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
               (A)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
               (B)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they
will prevent erosion.
               (C)   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
               (D)   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for construction of the channel.
               (E)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
               (F)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               (G)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features
shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
               (H)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               (I)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
               (J)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               (K)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
            (4)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         j.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
         k.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
            (1)   The construction areas shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior
to the initiation of improvements.
            (2)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be
applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization
shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any
portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may
not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60)
days.
            (3)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale, fences, check dams, diversion
ditches and sediment basins.
            (4)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25')
in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along
existing channels (see subsection B2p of this section). Construction vehicle
use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be
constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or
along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
            (5)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
         l.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         m.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
            (1)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in section
4-7-5 of this chapter must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the
study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be
contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data
to use.
            (2)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the designated floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
            (3)   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         n.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all
information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional
designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional
concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. The
final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans
or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating
activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of non-
government projects, the Municipality in incorporated areas and the County in
unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated
floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling,
grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval
is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         o.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
         p.   Criteria For Floodway Construction: For all activities in the
floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel,
the following criteria shall be met:
            (1)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within
at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            (2)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during
the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
            (3)   The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the
buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when
necessary, for stream maintenance purposes.
   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and
issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, construction as
necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or
structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed
in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final Letter of
Map Revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon
acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans.
      3.   State Review: For those projects listed below located in a
designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for
their review and concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by
a community or County delegated State permitting authority in the floodway.
         a.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to subsection B2d of this section.
         b.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection B2e of this section.
         c.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage pursuant to subsections B2a, B2b, and B2h of this section.
         d.   The construction of any IDNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in
section
4-7-2 of this chapter) and all other Federal, State, or local units of
government projects, including projects of the Municipality or County.
         e.   An engineer's determination that a proposed bridge affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening.
         f.   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood
profiles.
         g.   Projects in public bodies of water.
      4.   Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this
chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be
issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation
that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq. No correspondence from IDNR/OWR shall be required
if the project meets the requirements of regional permit 3. No permit from
IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated this responsibility to the
Village.
      5.   Permits For Dams: Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a dam as defined in section
4-7-2 of this chapter per 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3702 (Rules for Construction
of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of
a dam. If the Building Officer and Inspector finds a dam that does not have an
IDNR/OWR permit, the Building Officer and Inspector shall immediately notify
the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office. If the Building Officer and Inspector finds a dam
which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Building Officer and Inspector
shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office,
and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
      6.   Activities That Do Not Require A Registered Professional Engineer's
Review: The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
         a.   Underground and overhead utilities that:
            (1)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations,
or
            (2)   Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the
floodway, or
            (3)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet (3') below the existing
stream bed, and
            (4)   In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are
placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch
debris.
         b.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
            (1)   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope, and
            (2)   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation, and
            (3)   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall
location.
         c.   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences),
properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.

bank.
            (3)   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross- sectional
area of the stream channel or bank of the lake.
            (4)   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the
preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         e.   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            (1)   The approach roads will be five-tenths foot (0.5') (1/2 foot)
or less above natural grade.
            (2)   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing
up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile
or outfall invert.
            (3)   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least
two feet (2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall
be nonerosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel.
            (4)   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction.
            (5)   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed
within one year after authorization. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-2019)
4-7-8: OCCUPATION AND USE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT
IDENTIFIED:
   A.   Development: In floodplains, (including AE, AH, AO and unnumbered A
Zones) where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more
than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative
effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and
passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation.
      1.   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental
body, not exempted by State law, shall commence any development in a floodplain
without first obtaining a development permit from the Building Officer and
Inspector. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Building Officer and Inspector. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions; and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting
from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or
surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and the elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section
4-7-9 of this chapter.
   The application for a development permit shall also include the following
information:
         a.   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and
intended use;
         b.   Site location (including legal description) of the property,
drawn to scale, on the designated floodway maps, indicating whether it is
proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
         c.   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity.
         d.   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as
a minimum:
            (1)   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale and north arrow;
            (2)   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach
showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations, using the NAVD 1988, adjacent property lines and
ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between proposed
activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is in or near a
commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and
orientation of cross-sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale;
            (3)   Cross-section views of the project perpendicular to the flow
of floodwater and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed
conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view,
existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency
flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical
scales (horizontal and vertical); and
            (4)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed
areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
         e.   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted
showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of subsection B of this
section.
         f.   Any and all other local, State and Federal permits or approvals
that may be required for this type of development.
      2.   Calculation And Documentation: Based on the best available existing
data according to Federal, State or other sources, the Building Officer and
Inspector shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site,
the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection
4-7-5D of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be shown to
have been higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance
Rate Map identification is not in the floodplain and, therefore, not subject to
the requirements of this chapter. The Building Officer and Inspector shall
maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site
and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
      3.   Permits: The Building Officer and Inspector shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other Federal, State, and local
permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity.
The Building Officer and Inspector shall not issue the development permit
unless all required Federal, State, and local permits have been obtained.
   B.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the floodplain, where a
floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health,
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter.
      1.   Standards: Within all riverine floodplains where the floodway has
not been determined, the following standards shall apply:
         a.   The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state
in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the
project meets the engineering requirements of subsections
4-7-7B2a through B2l of this chapter, for the entire floodplain as calculated
under the provisions of subsection
4-7-5D of this chapter. As an alternative, the developer should have an
engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering
study to IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a designated floodway. Upon acceptance of
the floodway by IDNR/OWR and FEMA, the developer shall then demonstrate that
the project meets the requirements of section
4-7-7 of this chapter for the designated floodway. The floodway shall be
defined according to the definition of "designated floodway" in section
4-7-2 of this chapter.
         b.   A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant
first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR.
         c.   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
dam as defined in section
4-7-2 of this chapter per 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3702 (Rules for Construction
of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of
a dam. If the Building Officer and Inspector finds a dam that does not have an
IDNR/OWR permit, the Building Officer and Inspector shall immediately notify
the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office. If the Building Officer and Inspector finds a dam
which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Building Officer and Inspector
shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office,
and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
         d.   The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and
designated floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of
this chapter:
            (1)   Bridge and culvert crossings of streams in rural areas
meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide permit number 2;
            (2)   Barge fleeting facilities meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR
Statewide permit no. 3;
            (3)   Aerial utility crossings meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR
Statewide permit no. 4;
            (4)   Minor boat docks meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide
permit no. 5;
            (5)   Minor, non-obstructive activities meeting conditions of IDNR/
OWR Statewide permit no. 6; activities (not involving fill or positive change
in grade) are covered by this permit;
            (6)   Outfall structures and drainage ditch outlets meeting
conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide permit no. 7;
            (7)   Underground pipeline and utility crossings meeting the
conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide permit no. 8;
            (8)   Bank stabilization projects meeting the conditions of IDNR/
OWR Statewide permit no. 9;
            (9)   Accessory structures and additions to existing residential
buildings meeting the conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide permit no. 10;
            (10)   Minor maintenance dredging activities meeting conditions of
IDNR/OWR Statewide permit no. 11;
            (11)   Bridge and culvert replacement structures and bridge
widenings meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide permit no. 12;
            (12)   Temporary construction activities meeting conditions of
IDNR/OWR Statewide permit no. 13;
            (13)   Special uses of public waters meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR
Statewide permit no. 14; and
            (14)   Any development determined by IDNR/OWR to be located
entirely within a flood fringe area shall be exempt from State floodway permit
requirements.
         e.   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
      2.   Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal one and five-
tenths (1.5) times to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost
below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed
10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-2019)
4-7-9: PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS:
In addition to the requirements found in sections
4-7-6,
4-7-7 and
4-7-8 of this chapter, for development in flood fringes, designated floodways
and floodplains where no floodways have been identified, the following
requirements shall be met:
   A.   Public Health Standards:
      1.   No developments in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood
protection elevation (FPE) unless such materials are stored in a floodproofed
and anchored storage tank and certified by a PE or floodproofed building
constructed according to the requirements of section
4-7-10 of this chapter.
      2.   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      3.   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      4.   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer
lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all
manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
      5.   All other activities, defined as development, such as pools, fences,
filling, paving, etc., shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows or
increase potential flood damages.
   B.   Carrying Capacity And Notification: For all projects involving channel
modification, fill or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying
capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the Village shall
notify adjacent communities in writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance
of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
   C.   Protecting Buildings:
      1.   In addition to the damage prevention requirements in subsections
4-7-6B and
4-7-7B of this chapter, all buildings located within a floodplain, shall be
protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. This building
protection criteria applies to the following situations:
         a.   Construction or placement of a new building or alteration or
addition to an existing building valued at more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or seventy (70) square feet.
         b.   Substantial improvements or structural alterations made to an
existing building that increase the floor area by more than twenty percent
(20%) or equal or exceed the market value by fifty percent (50%). Alteration
shall be figured cumulatively during a 10-year period. If substantially
improved, the existing structure and the addition must meet the flood
protection standards of this section.
         c.   Repairs made to a substantially damaged building. These repairs
shall be figured cumulatively during a 10-year period. If substantially damaged
the entire structure must meet the flood protection standards of this section.
         d.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site (the building protection requirements do
not apply to returning a manufactured home to the same site it lawfully
occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage).
         e.   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than one hundred eighty (180) days per year; and

occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the
floodplain, will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-2019)
4-7-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Building Officer and
Inspector or Municipal Attorney may determine that a violation of the minimum
standards of this chapter exists. The Building Officer and Inspector or
Municipal Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The Village may make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.

on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The Village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   B.   The Building Officer and Inspector shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore,
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   C.   The Building Officer and Inspector is authorized to issue an order
requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall
be in writing, shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop- work
order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
   D.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the Building Officer and Inspector. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: 1) the
grounds for complaint or reasons for suspension or revocation; and 2) the time
and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine whether the permit
shall be suspended or revoked.
   E.   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-22-2019)

4-8-1: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the
Village by the Illinois Compiled Statutes.
      2.   The purpose of this Chapter is to diminish threats to public health,
safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new
development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the
inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of
downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources.
The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of
quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this Chapter
regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts.
   B.   Objectives: This Chapter is adopted to accomplish the following
objectives:
      1.   To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or
flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
      2.   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff;
      3.   To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased
flooding on a watershed basis;
      4.   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel
erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased
stormwater runoff quantities from new development;
      5.   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources;
      6.   To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats:
      7.   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order
to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
   C.   Incorporation and Adoption of the Will County Stormwater Management
Ordinance: The Will County Stormwater Management Ordinance found in Title V,
Chapter 55 of the Will County Ordinances is hereby adopted by the Village and
incorporated as if fully set forth herein. In the event of a conflict between

4-8-5: MINIMIZATION OF INCREASES IN RUNOFF VOLUMES AND RATES:
In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall
evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features which minimize
the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's
drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which
are consisted with the following hierarchy:

and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's
drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the
quantity of runoff pollutants.
   B.   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable.
Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space,
aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields),
wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using
portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management. (Ord. 1994-6,
4-12-1994)
4-8-7: DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS AND METHODS:
   A.   Release Rates: The drainage system for a property shall be designed to
control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 2-year, twenty
four (24) hour and 100-year, twenty four (24) hour rainfall events to levels
which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream
when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream
drainage capacities. The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the
2-year event shall not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property drained.
The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of
property drained.
   B.   Detention Basin Outlet Design: Backwater on the outlet structure from
the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet.
   C.   Detention Storage Requirements: The design maximum storage to be
provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year,
twenty four (24) hour rainfall event and reservoir (also called modified puls
or level pool) routing or equal. Detention storage shall be computed using
hydrograph methods as described in this Section.
   D.   Drainage System Design And Evaluation: The following criteria should be
used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective
is to provide capacity to pass the 10-year peak flow in the minor drainage
system and an overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity.
      1.   Design Methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas
up to ten (10) acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational
formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites.
Runoff hydrograph methods as described in subsection E of this Section must be
used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than ten
(10) acres of drainage area and for the design of all detention basins.
      2.   Positive Drainage: Whenever practicable, all areas of the property
must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a
stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity
of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the
minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street
ponding and flow depths shall not exceed six inches (6") at the crown of the
street inclusive of any required overland conveyance.
   E.   Methods For Generating Runoff Hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs shall be
developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and
antecedent moisture.
      1.   Rainfall: Under a continuous simulation approach to drainage system
hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois
State Water Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall
distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems
with critical durations less than or equal to twelve (12) hours. The third
quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis
of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than
twelve (12) and less than or equal to twenty four (24) hours. The fourth
quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with
durations greater than twenty four (24) hours. The first, third and fourth
quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in table 37 of Bulletin
70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff
distributions.
      2.   Antecedent Moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not
rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume
a conservative wet antecedent moisture condition as a minimum.
   F.   Wet Detention Basin Design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to
remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as
much as feasible to be available for recreational use.
      1.   Wet Basin Depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet (3') deep,
excluding nearshore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided
they shall be at least ten feet (10') deep over twenty five percent (25%) of
the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out.
      2.   Wet Basin Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the
normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than five to one (5:1) (horizontal
to vertical).
      3.   Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-
year event.
      4.   Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they
should be at opposite ends of the basin.
   G.   Dry Detention Basin Design: In addition to the other requirements of
this Chapter, dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to
be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available
to multiple uses.
      1.   Dry Basin Drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that eighty
percent (80%) of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than
seventy two (72) hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event.
Underdrains directed to the outlet control shall be used if necessary to
accomplish this requirement.
      2.   Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.
      3.   Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they
should be at opposite ends of the basin.
   H.   Minimum Detention Outlet Size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice
plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of
four inches (4"). If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater
than those specified in this Section, and regional detention is not a practical
alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate
self cleaning flow restrictors.
   I.   Detention In Floodplains: The placement of detention basins within the
floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable
operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements
of this Chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood
fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met.
      1.   Detention In Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the
volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including
any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be
controlled consistent with the requirements of this Section. The applicant
shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater
conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be
opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain storage
lost below the 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the ten-year
flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All
compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
      2.   Detention In Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with subsection I3 of this Section.
      3.   On-Stream Detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this Chapter with respect to water quality and control of the 2-
year and 100-year, twenty four (24) hour events from the property. Further
criteria are presented in Section
4-8-8 of this Chapter. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger
than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling
to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties
upstream of downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part
of on-stream detention:
         a.   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which
require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning,
         b.   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality
or stream aquatic habitat,
         c.   Shall not include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin,
         d.   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands,
         e.   Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source
management program throughout the upstream watershed,
         f.   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge, and
         g.   Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code parts 702 and
708 and the floodplain chapter of the Village.
   J.   Drainage Into Wetlands: Wetlands shall be protected from damaging
modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter,
the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage
flows into wetlands:
      1.   Detention In Wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for
the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the
existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will maintain
or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing
depressional storage in wetlands shall be maintained and the volume of
detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this Section shall be in
addition to this existing storage.
      2.   Sediment Control: The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and
shall not be filled.
      3.   Alteration Of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be
altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
the wetland.
      4.   Detention/Sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be
routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture
the 2-year, twenty four (24) hour event and hold it for at least twenty four
(24) hours, before being discharged to the wetland. This basis shall be
constructed before property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy
defined in Section
4-8-5 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged
to the wetland.
      5.   Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet
(25') in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be
maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland.
   K.   Street, Parking Lot And Culvert Drainage:
      1.   Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major
drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed more than six inches (6") at
the crown of the street inclusive of any required overland conveyance and shall
not remain flooded for more than eight (8) hours for any event less than or
equal to the 100-year event.
      2.   Parking Lots: The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking
area shall not exceed six inches (6") for more than four (4) hours.
      3.   Culvert Road And Driveway Crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings
shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the
culvert.
   L.   Infiltration Practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes,
infiltration practices including basins, trenches and porous pavement should be
located on soils in hydrological soil groups "A" or "B" as designated by the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to
recharge ground water shall not be located within seventy five feet (75') of a
water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be
provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach
infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more
than seventy two (72) hours over eighty percent (80%) of a dry basin's bottom
area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of
infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet (4') above seasonally
high ground water and bedrock.
   M.   Safety Considerations: The drainage system components, especially all
detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or
adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
      1.   Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year
capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the
basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention
basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1)
(horizontal to vertical).
      2.   Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety
ledge at least four feet (4') in width two and one-half feet to three feet (21/
2' to 3') below the normal water depth.
      3.   Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow.
      4.   Overflow Structures: All stormwater detention basins shall be
provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a
stage of at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the
vicinity of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure
shall be equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate.
   N.   Maintenance Considerations: The stormwater drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed slideslopes shall be
designed to allow lawnmowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins
shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain
the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by
gravity is not feasible.) Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where
feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy
equipment shall be provided. (Ord. 1994-6, 4-12-1994; amd. Ord. 2020-17, 6-23-
2020)
4-8-8: ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS:
Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in
the design of the property's drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows from
upstream areas that are not to be detained should be routed around the basin
being provided for the site being developed.
   A.   Upstream Areas Not Meeting Chapter Requirements: When there are areas
not meeting the storage and release rates of this Chapter, tributary to the
applicant's property, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall
be explored by the applicant. The following steps shall be followed:
      1.   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his
property using the release rates of Section
4-8-6, the applicant's property area, and the procedures described in Section
4-8-7.
      2.   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage
and release rate requirements of this Chapter, shall be identified.
      3.   Using the areas determined in subsection A2 above, plus the
applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined properties
shall be computed.
         a.   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined
property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in Section
4-8-7. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land
cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the purposes of computing
storage.
         b.   Once the necessary combined storage is computed the Village may
choose to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the
regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage
for his property as computed in subsection A1 above. If regional storage is
selected by the Village, then the design produced in this subsection A3 shall
be implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the Village, the applicant
shall bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever
practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin and
the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the applicant must meet the
provisions of this subsection for on-stream basins.
   B.   Upstream Areas Meeting Chapter Requirements: When there are areas which
meet the storage and release rate requirements of this Chapter, tributary to
the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the
applicant's detention basin, or be routed through the applicant's detention
basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for the
applicant's property shall still be computed as described in subsection A1 of
this Section. However, if the Village decides to route tributary area flows
through an applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be
based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas.
It must be shown that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's
property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property alone. (Ord.
1994-6, 4-12-1994)
4-8-9: EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES:
Where detention, retention or depressional storage areas are to be used as part
of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first
element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these
facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order
to maintain the design volume of the facilities. (Ord. 1994-6, 4-12-1994)
4-8-10: RESERVED:
(Ord. 1994-6, 4-12-1994)
4-8-11: MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY:
   A.   Definitions:
   MAINTENANCE OR MAINTAIN: Shall mean the inspection, cleaning out, mowing,
repairing, and removing of any and all accumulated sediment, leaves, nuisance,
noxious weeds, invasive or non-native plants debris and obstructions from all
detention ponds, leach basins, pollution control devices or similar
appurtenances of the stormwater drainage system such that a failure to maintain
would be likely to result in an impairment or impeding of the functioning of
the stormwater drainage system. For wet bottom ponds, maintenance shall also
include necessary services that promote a healthy pond ecosystem and prevent
invasive vegetation, algae blooms, or fish kills. All stormwater and drainage
systems or stormwater management facilities shall be continually stabilized to
prevent soil erosion.
   STORMWATER AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM OR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITY: Shall be
defined to include all stormwater systems, catch basins, storage structures,
drains, leaching basins, ponds, detention ponds, sediment basins, swales,
overflow weirs and/or structure restrictor manholes, ditches, pipes and
appurtenances located in the Village. This includes, but is not limited to, any
and all pollution control devices utilized as a part of the stormwater and
drainage system.
   B.   Maintenance Requirements: Maintenance of stormwater drainage systems
located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that
property and all future owners of the property. All maintenance of stormwater
and drainage systems shall be the sole financial responsibility of the property
owner. However, representatives of the Village shall be authorized to enter
onto the property at reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting and
determining the need for maintenance of any stormwater drainage system.
   C.   Maintenance Schedule: The design plans for any stormwater drainage
system shall include a written schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect
of the property's stormwater drainage system. Following the completion of any
stormwater drainage system, and after final approvals by the Village, the
property owner shall maintain the stormwater drainage system located on the
property on not less than an annual basis. The annual regular maintenance
schedule, as required by this section, shall be made available to the Village
upon reasonable written request by the Superintendent of Public Works (SPW). If
the SPW makes the determination that specific maintenance problems exist or
issues that require correction, the property owner shall complete the required
maintenance and correct any issues within thirty (30) calendar days of such
written notification. If the maintenance and/or correction of issues is not
made within the time period, the Village may, pursuant to the easement required
by section
4-14-9 of this title enter upon the property and either complete the
maintenance itself and assess all costs to the property owner, or contract with
other contractors for the completion of the maintenance work and assess those
costs to the property owner.
   D.   Bond: The Village also may, at its discretion, request a bond to be
provided by the property owner for maintenance of the stormwater drainage
system in an amount to be determined in the sole discretion of the Village.
(Ord. 2017-26, 10-24-2017)
4-8-12: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Inspections:
      1.   Inspections During Construction: General site grading shall not
begin until the Superintendent of Public Works has determined that any
necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. The Superintendent
of Public Works (SPW) or his representative will also conduct periodic
inspections of the work in progress to be certain that the drainage system is
being built as designed. If any violations of the provisions or requirements of
this chapter are noted during such inspections, the SPW shall notify the
property owner in writing of the items needing correction. The property owner
shall have ten (10) calendar days to make such corrections unless given a
specific extension of time in writing by the SPW. Failure to complete such
corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
      2.   Final Inspection: Upon notification by the applicant that the
drainage system is completed, the SPW or his representative shall conduct a
final inspection. If the drainage system is found to contain deficiencies which
require correction the SPW or his representative shall notify the property
owner of the necessary conditions. The property owner shall correct such
deficiencies within ten (10) calendar days unless given a specific extension of
time in writing by the SPW. Failure to make necessary corrections within the
specified time period shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
      3.   Routine Inspections: All privately owned drainage systems shall be
inspected by representatives of the Village not less often than once per year.
A written report shall be filed of the results of any inspection and a copy
sent to the property owner detailing any problems which need correction.
   B.   Enforcement: The administration and enforcement of this chapter shall
be the responsibility of the Superintendent of Public Works (SPW) or his
representatives.
   C.   Appeals: All appeals to the Superintendent of Public Works decisions
regarding the interpretation of this chapter shall be heard by the Village
Board of the Village. (Ord. 1994-6, 4-12-1994)
4-8-13: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is judged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall remain in force and not be affected by such judgment.
(Ord. 1994-6, 4-12-1994)
4-8-14: PENALTIES:
Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions or requirements of this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or be imprisoned for not more than
six (6) months. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. (Ord. 1994-6, 4-12-1994)
CHAPTER 9
SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
SECTION:
4-9-1 Findings And Purpose
4-9-2 Definitions
4-9-3 General Principles
4-9-4 Site Development Permit
4-9-5 Design And Operation Standards And Requirements
4-9-6 Enforcement
4-9-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Findings: The Board of Trustees of the Village hereby finds that:
      1.   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the
construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the
building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and
drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities;
      2.   The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles;
      3.   Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys, washed-
out fills, and embankments;
      4.   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
      5.   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and
      6.   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage
capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increased chances
of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
   B.   Purpose: The Board of Trustees therefore declares that the purpose of
this Chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the
environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and
controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or
other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the
movement of earth on land situated in the Village. It is the intention of this
Chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land-disturbing
activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have
occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state. (Ord.
1996-2, 1-9-1996)

4-9-3: GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation
caused by development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping,
excavating, and filling of land, in the village. Measures taken to control soil
erosion and off site sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment
is not transported from the site by a storm event of 10-year frequency or less.
The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the
village and to the preparation of the submissions required under section
4-9-4 of this chapter:
   A.   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   B.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands
should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
   C.   Special precaution should be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake,
pond, or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these
areas to erosion and sedimentation.
   D.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   E.   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
   F.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and
benefits involved.
   G.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   H.   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or
downstream.
   I.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional
as soon as practical during development.
   J.   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
   K.   All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be
properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   L.   All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from
being tracked onto public or private roadways. (Ord. 1996-2, 1-9-1996)
4-9-4: SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no
person shall commence or perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating,

to notify the Superintendent of Public Works of any significant changes which
occur in the site development schedule after the initial erosion and sediment
control plan has been approved.
   These submissions shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter and the standards and requirements contained in the latest version
of the Illinois Urban Manual prepared for Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA) by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) - Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Illinois and adopted by the Will
County and/or Grundy County Soil and Water Conservation District, which
standards and requirements are hereby incorporated into this chapter by
reference. (Ord. 2017-16, 6-27-2017)
   The Village Board may waive specific requirements for the content of
submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to show
that the work will comply with the objectives and principles of this chapter.
(Ord. 1996-2, 1-9-1996)
   E.   Bonds: The applicant is required to file with the Village a faithful
performance bond or bonds, letter of credit, or other improvement security
satisfactory to the Village Attorney in an amount deemed sufficient by the
Village Engineer to cover all costs of improvements, landscaping, maintenance
of improvements and landscaping, and soil erosion and sediment control measures
for such period as specified by the Village, and engineering and inspection
costs to cover the cost of failure or repair of improvements installed on the
site.
   F.   Review And Approval: Each application for a site development permit
shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures:
      1.   The Village Engineer will review each application for a site
development permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this
chapter and report his findings to the Village Board. The Village Engineer may
also refer any application to the Will and/or Grundy County Soil and Water
Conservation District and/or any other local government or public agency within
whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comment. Within sixty
(60) days after receiving an application, unless additional review time is
necessary, the Village Board, shall in writing: (Ord. 2017-16, 6-27-2017)
         a.   Approve the permit application if it is found to be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter and issue the permit;
         b.   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable
conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this
chapter and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
         c.   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies
and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.
      2.   No site development permit shall be issued for an intended
development site unless:
         a.   The development, including but not limited to subdivisions and
planned unit development, has been approved by the Village where applicable, or
         b.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the Village, or
         c.   The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall
development program previously approved by the Village for the area in which
the site is situated; and
         d.   All relevant Federal and State permits (i.e., for floodplains and
wetlands) have been received for the portion of the site subject to soil
disturbance. (Ord. 1996-2, 1-9-1996)
      3.   Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan, development
activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance with conditions
established by the Village. Failure of the Village Board to act on an
application or revised application within sixty (60) days of its submittal,
unless the Village Engineer has determined that additional review time is
necessary, shall entitle the applicant to appeal the delay in accordance with
the appeals procedure set forth hereinafter. (Ord. 2017-16, 6-27-2017)
   G.   Expiration Of Permit: Every site development permit shall expire and
become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been
commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days, or is not completed by a date
which shall be specified in the permit; except that the Village Board may, if
the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have
prevented work being commenced or completed within the specified time limits,
grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the
expiration date of the permit. The Village Board may require modification of
the erosion control plan to prevent any increase in erosion or offsite sediment
runoff resulting from any extension.
   H.   Appeals: The applicant, or any person or agency which received notice
of the filing of the application, may make an appeal of the decision of the
Village Board. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Village Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing, after giving fifteen (15) days' notice thereof. The
Village Board shall render a decision within thirty (30) days after the
hearing. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but need not be
limited to, the effects of the proposed development activities on the surface
water flow to tributary and downstream lands, any comprehensive watershed
management plans, or the use of any retention facilities; possible saturation
of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff
surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainageways; nature and
type of soil or rock which when disturbed by the proposed development
activities may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be
landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape
through grading or removal of vegetation. (Ord. 1996-2, 1-9-1996)
   I.   Retention Of Plans: Plans, specifications, and reports for all site
developments shall be retained in printable document format (PDF), as well as
in original form or on microfilm by the Village. (Ord. 2017-16, 6-27-2017)
4-9-5: DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: All clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and
filling which is subject to the permit requirements of this chapter shall be
subject to the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this section.
   B.   Responsibility: The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility
for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the Village or
its officers or agents will not be made liable for such damage, by: 1) the
issuance of a permit under this chapter, 2) compliance with the provisions of
that permit or with conditions attached to it by the Village Board, 3) failure
of Village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions,
4) failure of Village officials to recommend denial of or to deny a permit, or
5) exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter.
   C.   Site Design Requirements:
      1.   On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
         a.   For disturbed areas draining less than one (1) acre, filter
barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures)
shall be constructed to control all off-site runoff as specified in referenced
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet
(25'), may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
         b.   For disturbed areas draining more than one (1) but less than five
(5) acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed
at the downslope point of the disturbed area.
         c.   For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area.
         d.   Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for both
detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed
of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage and
each shall be sized for the 2-year, 24-hour runoff from the site under maximum
runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be
that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten (10)
hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only
drains the dry detention storage.
         e.   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated
sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction
period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in
one (1) year. For construction periods exceeding one (1) year, the 1-year
sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted.
      2.   Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and
diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 10-year frequency
storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
within forty eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards:
         a.   For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with
mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod
or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel.
         b.   For grades of four percent (4%) to eight percent (8%), sod or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied in the channel.
         c.   For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, riprap, or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively
reduced using drop structures.
      3.   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active
disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures.
         b.   Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be
stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent.
      4.   Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided,
where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met:
         a.   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to
the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap
or gravel.
         b.   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept
to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be
restabilized within forty eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is
completed, interrupted, or stopped.
         c.   Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall
be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted.
      5.   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps
or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. (Ord.
1996-2, 1-9-1996)
      6.   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be
protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
      7.   Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access
drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a
public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not
flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled
sediment disposal area.
      8.   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance to
their intended function.
      9.   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved
with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. (Ord.
1996-2, 1-9-1996; amd. Ord. 2008-33, 12-17-2008)
   D.   Handbooks Adopted By Reference: The standards and specifications
contained in "Standards And Specifications For Soil Erosion And Sediment
Control" (the Yellow Book) and the "Illinois Procedures And Standards For Urban
Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control" (the Green Book) cited in section
4-9-4 of this chapter, are hereby incorporated into this section and made a
part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods
of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans
approved under section
4-9-4 of this chapter. In the event of conflict between provisions of said
manuals and of this chapter, this chapter shall govern.
   E.   Maintenance Of Control Measures: All soil erosion and sediment control
measures necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter shall be maintained
periodically by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the period of land
disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure
adequate performance.
   F.   Inspection: The village board or its designee shall make inspections as
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with
the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved.
Plans for grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of
approval of the village board or its designee shall be maintained at the site
during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure
compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or
building permit, and this chapter the permittee shall notify the village board
or its designee within two (2) working days of the completion of the
construction stages specified below:
      1.   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding
with any other earth disturbance or grading,
      2.   After stripping and clearing,
      3.   After rough grading,
      4.   After final grading,
      5.   After seeding and landscaping deadlines, and
      6.   After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of
sediment controls.
   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases
or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the
completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an
inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five (5)
working days after notice is received by the village from the permittee, the
permittee may continue work at his own risk, without presuming acceptance by
the village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in
writing at the site.
   G.   Special Precautions:
      1.   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the village
board determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further
work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public
way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the village board may
require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
special precautions to be taken as is considered advisable to avoid the
likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be
limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant
materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils
engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for
further work.
      2.   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on
any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village board may
specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that
the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of
protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
   H.   Amendment Of Plans: Major amendments of the site development or erosion
and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the village board and
shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the
original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the
village board by written authorization to the permittee. (Ord. 1996-2, 1-9-
1996)
   I.   Stockpiles:
      1.   The area of land exposed during site development should be limited
to the smallest working area practicable. The period of time during which land
is exposed without vegetation should be limited to the shortest period
practicable.
      2.   The base of stockpiles shall not be located within two hundred feet
(200') of the perimeter of the development or within two hundred feet (200')
from the nearest home, and stockpiles shall not be located on floodplains,
overflow routes, areas subject to frequent inundation, or park sites.
Stockpiles shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than
twenty five feet (25') to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers,
including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed
immediately on the downslope side of the stockpiles.
      3.   Stockpiles shall not exceed twenty five feet (25') in height.
      4.   Any stockpile that remains undisturbed longer than seven (7) days
shall have approved sediment and erosion control measures, such as a silt
fence, surrounding the entire base of the stockpile, and a gradient ratio of
not more than three to one (3:1).
      5.   No stockpile shall be allowed to remain in the development phase
after completion of the last structure in that development phase, and no
occupancy permit shall be issued for the last structure in the development
phase until all dirt stockpiles are removed from that phase. Without prior
written approval from the village, all dirt stockpiles shall be removed for
each phase no later than three (3) years after the first building permit is
issued for that phase or prior to the issuance of the last occupancy permit in
the phase, whichever is first to occur.
      6.   The permittee, developer, and/or owner shall abide by the village's
noxious weeds ordinance (title 7, chapter 3 of this code), and shall not permit
weeds such as jimson, burdock, ragweed, thistle, cocklebur, poison ivy, poison
oak, poison sumac or other weeds of a like kind, to grow in and around any
stockpile.
      7.   Any stockpile that remains in the same place longer than one year
must be seeded or sodded and maintained in that condition for the remainder of
the term of that stockpile.
      8.   Stockpiles must be maintained in such a way as to minimize the
height and to minimize the danger to children, including the removal of all
potentially harmful debris.
      9.   All stockpiles in existence at the time of passage of this
subsection, but which do not conform to one or more provisions of this
subsection, shall be brought into compliance by July 30, 2009. (Ord. 2008-33,
12-17-2008)
4-9-6: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Exceptions: The village board may, in accordance with the following
procedures, authorize exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set
forth in this chapter:
      1.   Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition
of the applicant for a site development permit, stating fully the grounds of
the petition and the facts relied upon by the applicant. Such petition shall be
filed with the site development permit application. In order for the petition
to be granted, it shall be necessary that the village board find all of the
following facts with respect to the land referred to in the petition:
         a.   That the land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record, that it
is impossible or impractical for the applicant to comply with all of the
requirements of this chapter;
         b.   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         c.   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property.
      2.   Each application for an exception shall be referred to the village
board for review.
      3.   The village board shall hold a public hearing on each application
for exception, within thirty (30) days after receiving application, in the
manner provided with respect to appeals. After public hearing, the village
board may approve the site development permit application with the exceptions
and conditions it deems necessary or it may disapprove such site development
permit application and exception application or it may take such other action
as appropriate.
   B.   Stop Work Order; Revocation Of Permit: In the event any person holding
a site development permit pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the
permit, or carries on site development in such a manner as to materially
adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working
in the neighborhood of the development site or so as to be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in
the neighborhood, the village board may suspend or revoke the site development
permit.
      1.   Suspension of a permit shall be by a written stop work order issued
by the village board and delivered to the permittee or his agent or the person

4-10-2: SHORT TITLE:
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the MINOOKA LOWLAND CONSERVANCY
OVERLAY DISTRICT ORDINANCE. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-3: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the present and future residents of Minooka and downstream
drainage areas by providing for the protection, preservation, proper
maintenance, and use of Minooka watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplain and
wetland areas. This chapter is more specifically adopted:
   A.   To prevent flood damage by preserving storm and flood water storage
capacity;
   B.   To maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, floodplains,
ponds, lakes, wetlands, and ground water by storing and providing for
infiltration of wet period runoff in floodplains and wetlands, and releasing it
slowly to the stream to maintain in-stream flow;
   C.   To manage stormwater runoff and maintain natural runoff conveyance
systems, and minimize the need for major storm sewer construction and
drainageway modification;
   D.   To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments and
attached pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds before they drain into
streams or wetlands, and by maintaining the natural pollutant assimilating
capabilities of streams, floodplains and wetlands;
   E.   To protect shorelines and stream banks from soil erosion, using natural
means and materials wherever possible;
   F.   To protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding grounds;
   G.   To protect wildlife habitat;
   H.   To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic, or scientific
interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species;
   I.   To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing areas;
and
   J.   To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of life of
the Village which depends in part on an adequate quality of water, a pleasing
natural environment, and recreational opportunities in proximity to the
Village.
In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this Chapter, Village hereby
designates the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District which shall be considered
as an overlay to the zoning districts created by the Village zoning ordinances
as amended. Any proposed development activity within the District must obtain a
special use permit as approved by the governing body of the Village. (Ord.
1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-4: DEFINITIONS:
ARMORING: A form of channel modification which involves the placement of
materials (concrete, riprap, bulkheads, etc.) within a stream channel or along
a shoreline to protect property above streams, lakes and ponds from erosion and
wave damage caused by wave action and stream flow.
BULKHEAD: A retaining wall that protects property along water.
CHANNEL: A natural or artificial watercourse of perceptible extent that
periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a connecting
link between two (2) bodies of water. It has a definite bed and banks that
serve to contain the water.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION OR CHANNELIZATION: To alter a watercourse by changing the
physical dimension or materials of the channel. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody vegetation.
Channel modification does not include the clearing of debris or trash from the
watercourse. Channelization is a severe form of channel modification involving
a significant change in the channel cross-section and typically involving
relocation of the existing channel (e.g., straightening).
CONTROL STRUCTURES: A structure designed to control the rate of stormwater
runoff that passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and
downstream water surface elevation.
CULVERT: A structure designed to carry drainage water or small streams below
barriers such as roads, driveways, or railway embankments.
DEPRESSION 1 AREA: Any area which is lower in elevation on all sides than
surrounding properties (i.e., does not drain freely), or whose drainage is
severely limited such as by a restrictive culvert. A depressional area will
fill with water on occasion when runoff into it exceeds the rate of
infiltration into underlying soil or exceeds the discharge through its
controlled outlet. Large depressional areas may provide significant stormwater
or floodplain storage.
DEVELOPMENT: The carrying out of any building, agricultural, or mining
operation, or the making of any change in the use or appearance of land, and
the dividing of land into two (2) or more parcels. The following activities or
uses shall be taken, for the purposes of this Chapter, to involve development
as defined herein:
   A.   Any construction, reconstruction, or alteration of a structure to
occupy more or less ground area, or the on-site preparation for same;
   B.   Any change in the intensity of use of land, such as an increase in the
number of dwelling units on land, or a material increase in the site coverage
of businesses, manufacturing establishments, offices, and dwelling units,
including mobile homes, campers, and recreational vehicles, on land;
   C.   Any agricultural use of land including, but not limited to, the use of
land in horticulture, floriculture, forestry, dairy, livestock, poultry,
beekeeping, pisciculture, and all forms of farm products and farm production;
   D.   The commencement of drilling, except to obtain soil samples, or the
commencement of mining, filling, excavation, dredging, grading or other
alterations of the topography;
   E.   Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site;
   F.   Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction for agricultural,
private residential, commercial or industrial use;
   G.   Deposit of refuse, solid or liquid waste, or fill on a parcel of land,
or the storage of materials;
   H.   Construction, excavation, or fill operations relating to the creation
or modification of any road, street, parking facility or any drainage canal, or
to the installation of utilities or any other grading activity that alters the
existing topography;
   I.   Construction or erection of dams, levees, walls, fences, bridges or
culverts; and
   J.   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity
of flood or surface waters.
DISTRICT: The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District as defined in Section
4-10-6-2 of this Chapter.
EROSION: The general process whereby soils are moved by flowing water or wave
action.
FILTERED VIEW: The maintenance or establishment of woody vegetation of
sufficient density to screen developments from a stream or wetland, to provide
for streambank stabilization and erosion control, to serve as an aid to
infiltration of surface runoff, and to provide cover to shade the water. The
vegetation need not be so dense as to completely block the view. Filtered view
means no clear cutting.
FLOODPLAIN: That land adjacent to a body of water with ground surface
elevations at or below the 100-year frequency flood elevation.
FLOODWAY: That portion of the floodplain (sometimes referred to as the base
floodplain or special flood hazard area) required to store and convey the base
flood. The floodway is the 100-year floodway as designated and regulated by the
Illinois Department of Transportation/Division of Water Resources. The
remainder of the floodplain which is outside the regulatory floodway is
referred to as the flood fringe or floodway fringe.
HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS: The features of a watercourse which determine its
water conveyance capacity. These features include but are not limited to: size
and configuration of the cross-section of the watercourse and floodway; texture
and roughness of materials along the watercourse; alignment of watercourse;
gradient of watercourse; amount and type of vegetation within the watercourse;
and size, configuration, and other characteristics of structures within the
watercourse. In low-lying areas the characteristics of the overbank area also
determine water conveyance capacity.
LAKE OR POND: Any inland waterbody, fed by spring or surface water flow.
LOT: An area of land, with defined boundaries, that is designated in official
assessor's records as being one parcel.
NATURAL: In reference to watercourses, means those stream channels, grassed
waterways and swales formed by the existing surface topography of the earth
prior to changes made by unnatural causes. A natural stream tends to follow a
meandering path; its floodplain is not constrained by levees; the area near the
bank has not been cleared, mowed or cultivated; the stream flows over soil and
geologic materials typical of the area with no alteration of the course or
cross-section of the stream caused by filling or excavating.
ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK (OHWM): The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave a
distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristics.
QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL: A person trained in one or more of the disciplines of
biology, geology, soil science, engineering, or hydrology whose training and
experience ensure a competent analysis and assessment of stream, lake, pond and
wetland conditions and impacts.
REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER: A professional engineer registered under the
provisions of "The Illinois Professional Engineering Act" and any act
amendatory thereof.
RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A facility that provides for storage of storm
water runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or
storm.
RUNOFF: The portion of precipitation on the land that is not absorbed by the
soil or plant material and which runs off the land.
SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris, and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in water bodies or watercourses.
SETBACK: The horizontal distance between any portion of a structure or any
development activity and the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or
intermittent stream, the ordinary high water mark of a lake or pond, or the
edge of a wetland, measured from the structure's or development's closest point
to the ordinary high water mark, or edge.
STREAM: A body of running water flowing continuously or intermittently in a
channel on or below the surface of the ground; 7.5 minute topographic maps of
the U.S. Geological Survey are one reference for identifying perennial and
intermittent streams. For purposes of this Chapter, the term "stream" does not
include storm sewers.
STRUCTURE: Anything that is constructed, erected or moved to or from any
premises which is located above, on, or below the ground including, but not
limited to roads, signs, billboards, and mobile homes. Temporary recreational
facilities including, but not limited to, tents, camper trailers, and
recreation vehicles are not considered structures when used less than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year and located landward of the minimum setback
provided as a natural vegetation strip.
VEGETATION: All plant growth, especially trees, shrubs, mosses, and grasses.
WATERCOURSE: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, slough, gulch, draw, ditch, channel, conduit, culvert,
swale, grass waterway, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or man-made drainageway,
which has a definite channel, bed and banks, in or into which stormwater runoff
and floodwater flow either regularly or intermittently.
WETLAND: Those transitional lands between terrestrial and aquatic system where
the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by
shallow water. Classification of areas as wetlands shall follow the
"Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States" as
published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS/OBS-79/31). (Ord. 1996-1,
1-9-1996)
4-10-5: SPECIAL USE PERMIT:
To ensure that proposed development activity can be carried out in a manner
which is compatible and harmonious with the natural amenities of the Lowland
Conservancy Overlay District and with surrounding land uses, a request for a
special use permit for such development activity must be submitted for approval
by the governing body of the Village.
No special use permit shall be issued unless the Village finds that:
   A.   The development will not detrimentally affect or destroy natural
features such as ponds, streams, wetlands, and forested areas, nor impair their
natural functions, but will preserve and incorporate such features into the
development's site;
   B.   The location of natural features and the site's topography have been
considered in the designing and siting of all physical improvements;
   C.   Adequate assurances have been received that the clearing of the site of
topsoil, trees, and other natural features will not occur before the
commencement of building operations; only those areas approved for the
placement of physical improvements may be cleared;
   D.   The development will not reduce the natural retention storage capacity
of any watercourse, nor increase the magnitude and volume of flooding at other
locations; and that in addition, the development will not increase stream
velocities; and
   E.   The soil and subsoil conditions are suitable for excavation and site
preparation, and the drainage is designed to prevent erosion and
environmentally deleterious surface runoff.
There shall be no development, including the immediate or future clearing or
removal of natural ground cover and/or trees, within the Lowland Conservancy
Overlay District for any purpose, unless a special use permit is granted
subject to the provisions of this Chapter or the provisions of the Village
Zoning Ordinance 1. See Title 5 of this Code.1.
Dumping, filling, mining, excavating, dredging, or transferring of any earth
material within the district is prohibited unless a special use permit is
granted.
No ponds or impoundments shall be created nor other alterations or improvements
shall be allowed in the district for recreational uses, storm water management,
flood control, agricultural uses or as scenic features unless a special use
permit is granted. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)

Each application for a special use permit shall be reviewed and acted upon
according to the following procedures:
   A.   The Village Board will review each application for a special use permit
to determine its conformance with the provisions of this Chapter. The Board may
also refer any application to the Will County and/or Grundy County Soil and
Water Conservation District and/or any other local government or public agency
within whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comments. Within
thirty (30) days after receiving an application, the Village Board shall in
writing: 1) approve the permit application, if it is found to be in conformance
with the provisions of this Chapter and issue the permit; 2) approve the permit
application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure
substantially the objectives of this Chapter, and issue the permit subject to
these conditions; or 3) disapprove the permit application, indicating the
deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or
submission.
   B.   No special use permit shall be issued for an intended development site
unless:
      1.   The development, including but not limited to subdivisions and
planned unit developments, has been approved by the Village where applicable;
or
      2.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the Village; or
      3.   The proposed development is coordinated with any overall development
program previously approved by the Village for the area in which the site is
situated.
   C.   Failure of the Village to act on an original or revised application
within thirty (30) days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in
accordance with the plans as filed, unless such time is extended by agreement
between the Village and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a
revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance
with conditions established by the Village. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-5-5: PERMIT EXCEPTIONS:
The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to:
   A.   Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property; when emergency
work is performed under this Section, the person performing it shall report the
pertinent facts relating to the work to the Village within ten (10) days after
commencement of the work and shall thereafter obtain a special use permit and
shall perform such work as may be determined by the agency to be reasonably
necessary to correct any impairment to the watercourse, lake, pond, floodplain
or wetland (in terms of the purposes of this Chapter, subsection
4-10-3A through J);
   B.   Work consisting of the operation, repair, or maintenance of any lawful
use of land existing on the date of adoption of the Ordinance codified in this
Chapter;
   C.   Lands adjacent to farm ditches if:
      1.   Such lands are not adjacent to a natural stream or river; or
      2.   Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not
streams before ditching; or
      3.   Such lands are maintained in agricultural uses without buildings and
structures.
   Where farm ditches are found to contribute to adverse environmental impacts
or hazards to persons or property, the Village may include designated farm
ditches in the District. The Village may also require that linings, bulkheads,
dikes and culverts to be removed to mitigate hazards, or that other mitigative
measures be taken, such as the maintenance of a natural vegetation buffer
strip. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-5-6: EFFECT ON OTHER PERMITS:
The granting of a special use permit under the provisions herein shall in no
way affect the owner's responsibility to obtain the approval required by any
other statute, ordinance, or regulation of any State agency or subdivision
thereof, or to meet other Village ordinances and regulations. Where State and/
or Federal permits are required, a special use permit will not be issued until
they are obtained. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS; AREA AFFECTED:
This Chapter applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds and
wetlands within the Village. Streams, lakes, and ponds (including intermittent
streams) are those which are shown on the United States Department of the
Interior Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle maps and those
additional streams, lakes, and ponds delineated on maps adopted as part of this
Chapter. Those maps are hereby made a part of this Chapter, and two (2) copies
thereof shall remain on file in the office of the Village Clerk for public
inspection. Within the jurisdiction of the Village, those waterbodies and
watercourses that are named and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter
are: (list of waterbodies and watercourses). Wetlands are those designated in
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Illinois Department of Conservation wetland
inventory and those additional wetlands delineated on maps adopted as part of
this Chapter.
If new drainage courses, lakes, ponds or wetlands are created as part of a
development, the requirements for setbacks and uses within setbacks, and the
criteria for watercourse relocation and minor modification shall apply. The
District shall be amended as appropriate to include these areas. (Ord. 1996-1,
1-9-1996)
4-10-6-1: LOWLAND CONSERVANCY OVERLAY DISTRICT:
The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District shall be considered as an overlay to
the zoning districts created by the Village Zoning Ordinance as amended 1. See
Title 5 of this Code. 1. In addition to the requirements of this Chapter,
applicants for a special use permit within the District shall meet all
requirements of the underlying zoning districts. In the event of a conflict
between the overlay district requirements and the underlying zoning district
requirements, the most restrictive requirements prevail. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-
1996)
4-10-6-2: DISTRICT BOUNDARY:
The procedures, standards and requirements contained in this Chapter shall
apply to all lots within wetlands and streams, and all lots lying wholly or in
part:
   A.   Within the special flood hazard area (SFHA) designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); or
   B.   Within one hundred feet (100') of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM)
of a perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high water mark of a
lake or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or
   C.   Within depressional areas serving as floodplain or stormwater storage
areas, as designated on the Lowland Conservancy District Map.
The District is designated on a map labeled "Lowland Conservancy Overlay
District Map", which is made to be part of this Chapter and which has the same
force and effect as if all the notations, references, and descriptions shown
thereon were set forth or described herein. Designated areas are shown on said
Map which shall be and remain on file in the office of the Village Clerk, and
additional areas may be approved from time to time and be made exhibits hereto.
(Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-6-3: MINIMUM SETBACK OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY FROM STREAMS:
   A.   Minimum Setback: Absolutely no development activity (except as provided
below) may occur within the minimum setback which is defined as seventy five
feet (75') from the ordinary high water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, or
the edge of wetlands, or within a designated depressional area. In no case
shall the setback be less than the boundary of the 100-year floodway as defined
by FEMA. These setback requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert
unless the stream is taken out of the culvert as part of development activity.
If a culvert functions as a low-flow culvert, where water is intended to
periodically flow over it, the setback requirements apply.
   B.   Development Activities: The following development activities may be
permitted, subject to issuance of a special use permit, as set out in Section
5-10-9 of this Code, within the minimum setback areas only if, as a practical
matter, they cannot be located outside the setback area. Such development
activities will only be approved based upon a report, prepared by a qualified
professional, which demonstrates that they will not adversely affect water
quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant habitat area. adversely affect
drainage and/or stormwater retention capabilities; adversely affect flood
conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth conditions, create erosion
hazards, or be materially detrimental to any other property in the area of the
subject property or to the Village as a whole, including the loss of open space
or scenic vistas:
      1.   Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations,
informational displays, directional signs, foot bridges, observation decks, and
docks;
      2.   The maintenance, repair, replacement, and reconstruction of existing
highways and bridges, electrical transmission and telecommunication lines,
poles, and towers; and
      3.   The establishment and development of public and private parks and
recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic natural and scientific
areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and
animal farms, wildlife preserves and public boat launching ramps.
   C.   Considerations: Review of the proposed development activity within the
minimum setback area will consider the following:
      1.   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the development of
public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park
shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and maintenance of
roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for permitted uses
are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate location
outside of the setback area is available.
      2.   Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be
permitted for the development of stormwater drainage swales between the
developed area of the site (including a stormwater detention facility on the
site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetlands detention basins within the
setback are generally discouraged, unless it can be shown that resultant
modifications will not impair water quality, habitat, or flood storage
functions.
      3.   No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to
install piers for the limited development of walkways and observation decks.
Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and
should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois Natural
Areas Inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species.
      4.   Wetland area occupied by the development of decks and walkways must
be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement.
      5.   Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of stormwater
management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved and total
wetland acreage is preserved. Where such modification is permitted, wetlands
shall be protected from the effects of increased stormwater runoff by measures
such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer strips,
and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. The direct
entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided. Environmental impact
analysis of wetland modification may be required in accordance with Section 4-
10-8 of this Chapter.
   D.   Applicants For Special Use Permit:
      1.   An applicant for a special use permit must stabilize areas left
exposed after land surface modification with vegetation normally associated
with that stream or wetland. The planting of native riparian vegetation is
recommended as the preferred stabilization measure. Other techniques should be
used only when and where vegetation fails to control erosion. The preferred
alternative is riprap, using natural rock materials where practicable,
installed on eroding bank areas in a manner that provides interstitial space
for vegetative growth and habitat for macroinvertebrates and other stream
organisms. Lining of the stream channel bottom is not permitted.
      2.   The applicant shall minimize access to the applicant's proposed
development activity within all or part of the Lowland Conservancy Overlay
District where such access could adversely affect the stream, lake, pond,
wetland, or related environmentally sensitive areas. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-6-4: SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
A site development plan must be prepared for any proposed development within,
or partly within, the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and must indicate:
   A.   Dimension and area of parcel, showing also the vicinity of the site in
sufficient detail to enable easy location, in the field, of the site for which
the special use permit is sought, and including the boundary line, underlying
zoning, a legend, a scale, and a north arrow (this requirement may be satisfied
by the submission of a separate vicinity map);
   B.   Location of any existing and proposed structures;
   C.   Location of existing or proposed on-site sewage systems or private
water supply systems;
   D.   Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond, and its
ordinary high water mark;
   E.   Location and landward limit of all wetlands;
   F.   Location of setback lines as defined in this Chapter;
   G.   Location of the 100-year floodway;

   I.   Specifications and dimensions of stream, wetland or other water areas
proposed for alterations;
   J.   Cross-sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood storage
volumes; and
   K.   Such other information as reasonably requested by the Village.
The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified professional,
that demonstrates that the proposed development activity will not endanger
health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or diversion of flood
flow. The developer shall also show, by submitting appropriate calculations and
resource inventories, that the proposed development activity will not
substantially reduce natural floodwater storage capacity, destroy valuable
habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna, adversely affect water quality or
ground water resources, increase stormwater runoff velocity so that water
levels on other lands are substantially raised or the danger from flooding
increased, or adversely impact any other natural stream, floodplain, or wetland
functions, and is otherwise consistent with the intent of this Chapter. (Ord.

The site proposed for development shall be investigated to determine the soil
and geologic characteristics, including soil erosion potential. A report,
prepared by a licensed professional engineer, geoscientist, or soil scientist
experienced in the practice of geologic and soil mechanics, shall be submitted
with every application for land development within the Lowland Conservancy
Overlay District. This report shall include a description of soil type and
stability of surface and subsurface conditions. Any area which the
investigation indicates as being subject to geologic or soil hazards shall not
be subjected to development, unless the engineer or soil scientist can
demonstrate conclusively that these hazards can be overcome. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-
1996)
4-10-6-6: HYDROLOGIC CONTROLS/DRAINAGE CONTROL PLAN:
A drainage control plan that describes the hydraulic characteristics of on-site

   B.   Runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g., roofs,
driveways, streets, patios, etc.) shall be collected and transported to a
drainageway (preferably a natural drainageway) with sufficient capacity to
accept the discharge without undue erosion or detrimental impact. Vegetated
drainage swales are preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or other
manufactured materials.
The drainage control plan shall identify appropriate measures, such as recharge
basins and detention/retention basins, which will limit the quantitative and
qualitative effects of stormwater runoff to pre-development conditions. (Ord.

where necessary, to prevent direct runoff and erosion from any modified land
surface into a stream, lake, pond, or wetland. All parking and vehicle
circulation areas should be located as far as possible from a stream, lake,
pond or wetland.
   E.   Limit Activity: The Village may limit development activity in or near a
stream, lake, pond, or wetland to specific months, and to a maximum number of
continuous days or hours, in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the
Village may require that equipment be operated from only one side of a stream,
lake, or pond in order to minimize bank disruption. Other development
techniques, conditions, and restrictions may be required in order to minimize
adverse impacts on streams, lakes, ponds or wetlands, and on any related areas
not subject to development activity. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-6-8: NATURAL VEGETATION BUFFER STRIP REQUIRED:
To minimize erosion, stabilize the stream bank, protect water quality, maintain
water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and wildlife habitat, to
screen manmade structures, and also to preserve aesthetic values of the natural
watercourse and wetland areas, a natural vegetation strip shall be maintained
along the edge of the stream, lake, pond or wetland. The natural vegetation
strip shall extend landward a minimum of twenty five feet (25') from the
ordinary high water mark of a perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond
and the edge of a wetland.
Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may be selectively pruned
or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a filtered view of
the water body from the principal structure and for reasonable private access
to the stream, lake, pond or wetland. Said pruning and removal activities shall
ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for stream bank
stabilization and erosion control.
A landscape plan, prepared by a professional landscape architect, shall be
submitted with each special use permit application for development activity
within the lowland conservancy overlay district and contain the following:
   A.   A plan describing the existing vegetative cover of the property and
showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part of the
proposed construction; and
   B.   A plan describing the proposed revegetation of disturbed areas
specifying the materials to be used.
The vegetation must be planned in such a way that access for stream maintenance
purposes shall not be prevented. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-6-9: MITIGATION OF DIRECT IMPACTS:
Direct impacts to jurisdictional waters of the United States, including
jurisdictional wetland, shall be mitigated at a minimum replacement ratio of
1.5:1 (replacement area:impact area). Mitigation for the impacts shall meet or
exceed the quality of the area impacted based on a floristic evaluation of the
impacted area. Mitigation areas shall be managed and monitored for a period of
five (5) years following seeding of the mitigation area(s). The development of
the mitigation area and its management and monitoring program shall be
described in a written document submitted as part of the special use permit
application. The document shall be based on the most current guidelines for
mitigation available from the Chicago district of the corps of engineers. (Ord.

Armoring in the form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or devices is not
permitted except in accordance with the following:
   A.   Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way and the use of
vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the
shoreline or bank;
   B.   The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland, or between
a wetland and a lake or pond;
   C.   The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the transmittal of
wave energy or currents to other properties; and
   D.   The exchange in the horizontal or vertical configuration of the land
must be kept to a minimum.
Where permission to install bulkheads or other armoring devices is requested as
part of the special use permit application, documentation and certification
pertaining to the items above must be submitted. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)

culverts as a convenience, in order to facilitate general site design, is not
to be considered.
   B.   The culvert must allow passage of fish inhabiting the stream, and
accommodate the 100-year flood event without increasing upstream flooding,
except where a restricting culvert is desirable as part of an overall storm and
floodwater management plan;
   C.   The culvert must be maintained free of debris and sediment to allow
free passage of water, and if applicable, fish; and
   D.   The stream bottom should not be significantly widened for the placement
of a culvert as this increases siltation; if multiple culverts must be
installed, one culvert should be at the level of the bottom of the stream and
the others at or above normal water elevation. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)
4-10-7-5: ON-STREAM IMPOUNDMENTS:
Impoundment of streams is not permitted except in accordance with the
following:

regional stormwater detention, flood control, or public recreation;
   B.   The impoundment will not prevent the upstream migration of indigenous
fish species;
   C.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants;
   D.   Impoundments without permanent low-flow pools are preferred except
where a permanent pool is necessary to achieve the intended benefits of the
impoundment (e.g., recreation or water quality mitigation); and
   E.   Impoundment design shall include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank
stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin. (Ord. 1996-1, 1-9-1996)

4-12-2 Satellite Antenna Regulations
4-12-1: DEFINITION:
SATELLITE ANTENNA: Any parabolic or spherical antenna which receives television
or other signals from orbiting satellites or other devices. The height of a
ground mounted antenna shall be the total maximum to which it is capable of
being raised and shall be measured from the highest point of the finished grade
adjacent to the structure. The height of a roof mounted antenna shall be the
total maximum to which it is capable of being raised and shall be measured from
the highest point of the finished grade of the roof adjacent to the structure.
A satellite antenna shall be considered as an accessory structure when it is
not part of a public utility. (Ord. 1985-21, 11-25-1985)
4-12-2: SATELLITE ANTENNA REGULATIONS:
   A.   In all zoning districts the following requirements apply:
      1.   Guywires and satellite antennas shall be considered an accessory
structure and shall meet setbacks for accessory structures except where it is a

4-14-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Findings Of Fact: It is hereby determined that:
      1.   Development projects alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
      2.   This stormwater runoff causes increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants; and
      3.   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from
development sites.
   Therefore, the village of Minooka establishes these policies applicable to
all discharges to surface waters within the village to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of
stormwater runoff discharges from development projects and other construction
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.
   B.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this
jurisdiction. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      1.   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
      2.   Minimize pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development that
would otherwise degrade local water quality;
      3.   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
      4.   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety.
   C.   Applicability: This chapter shall be applicable to all development
applications for sites of 1.0 acre or more, unless eligible for an exemption or
granted a waiver by the village under the specifications of section
4-14-4 of this chapter. This chapter also applies to development activities
that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are
part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following
applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct development
activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the village has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development
sites to the maximum extent practicable. The following activities may be exempt
from these stormwater performance criteria: Repairs to any stormwater treatment
practice deemed necessary by the village.
   When a development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment
project as defined in section
4-14-2 of this chapter, decisions on permitting shall be determined by the
building and zoning officer and the village engineer shall determine on site
stormwater requirements. This determination shall be dependent upon the amount
of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water
quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined
after review by the village board.
   D.   Compatibility With Other Permit And Ordinance Requirements: This
chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

activities of 1.0 acre or more without first meeting the requirements of this
chapter prior to commencing the proposed activity.
   B.   Application Requirements: The stormwater management plan shall be
prepared to meet the requirements of section
4-14-5 of this chapter, the maintenance agreement shall be prepared to meet the
requirements of section
4-14-9 of this chapter, and applicable fees. The stormwater management plan
need not consist of separate documents but may be incorporated into the
drawings and specifications for the project.
   C.   Application Procedure: Applications for land disturbance activity
permits must be accompanied by four (4) sets of drawings submitted to the
building and zoning officer. (Ord. 2009-05, 1-27-2009)
4-14-4: WAIVERS TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Waiver Eligibility Criteria: Every applicant shall provide for
stormwater management as required by this chapter unless this requirement is
waived by the village planning and zoning commission.
   The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or
in part by the village planning and zoning commission after a hearing, upon
request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following
conditions applies:
      1.   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      2.   Alternative minimum requirements for on site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan
that has been approved by the village and the implementation of the plan is
required by local ordinance.
      3.   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off site facility.
The off site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long term operation and maintenance of the
stormwater practice.
      4.   The village finds that meeting the minimum on site management
requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      5.   Nonstructural practices will be used on the sites that reduce: a)
the generation of stormwater from the site, b) the size and cost of stormwater
storage and c) the pollutants generated at the site. These nonstructural
practices are explained in detail in the "Illinois Urban Manual".
   B.   Assurances Required For Waiver: In instances where one of the
conditions above applies, the village may grant a waiver from strict compliance
with these stormwater management provisions, as long as the variance will not
result in the following impacts to downstream waterway:
      1.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      2.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      3.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; or
      4.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and
property. (Ord. 2009-05, 1-27-2009)
4-14-5: GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT:
Unless judged by the village to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all
development sites one acre or greater:
   A.   All site designs shall, to the maximum extent practicable, establish
stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater
discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
stormwater runoff and stormwaterborne pollutants. These practices should seek
to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater
runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas
to the maximum extent practical. Preference should generally be given to
stormwater detention facilities that incorporate wet or wetland bottom
detention facilities where practical. Where wet stormwater detention facilities
are provided, all flows shall be routed through the detention facility (i.e.,
low flows shall not be bypassed).
   B.   Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, preference may be given
to dry basins with low flow bypass if the facility is proposed for multiple
uses that require that the pond bottom be dry as much as practical.
   C.   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practical,
including, but not limited to, open spaces, recreation, and wetlands. The
applicant should avoid using the portions of the property exclusively for
stormwater management.
   D.   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the "Illinois Urban
Manual".
   E.   Development projects disturbing one acre or more of land cover shall
submit a notice of intent (NOI) to the Illinois environmental protection agency
and comply with all the provisions of the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) general permit ILR10 or its equivalent and shall
submit a copy of the required storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) to
the village.
   F.   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement an
SWPPP, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the
NPDES general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   G.   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the village
building and zoning officer to determine if they are subject to additional
stormwater design requirements.
   H.   The calculations for determining peak flows as required by chapter 8 of
this title shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices where
applicable. (Ord. 2009-05, 1-27-2009)
4-14-6: BASIC STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   Minimum Control Requirements: All stormwater management practices will
be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes as required by
the village are met, unless the village grants the applicant a waiver or the
applicant is exempt from such requirements.
   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control
than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the village reserves
the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to
control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   B.   Site Design Feasibility: Stormwater management practices for a site
shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors
that should be considered:
      1.   Topography;
      2.   Maximum drainage area;
      3.   Depth to water table;
      4.   Soils;
      5.   Slopes;
      6.   Terrain;
      7.   Head; and
      8.   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or ultra-
urban areas.
   Applicants shall consult the "Illinois Urban Manual" for guidance on the
factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater
management practice.
   C.   Conveyance Issues: All stormwater management practices shall be
designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
      2.   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
      3.   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
      4.   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
   The village design standards and the "Illinois Urban Manual" shall provide
detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved
stormwater management practices.
   D.   Treatment/Geometry Conditions: All stormwater management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff according to the
specifications outlined in the "Illinois Urban Manual". These specifications
will designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to
an approved stormwater management practice.
   E.   Landscaping Plans Required: All stormwater management practices must
have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the approved
stormwater management practice and how and who will manage and maintain this
vegetation. (Ord. 2009-05, 1-27-2009)
4-14-7: REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL:
   A.   Stormwater Management Plan Required For All Developments: No
application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater
management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality
impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed, unless
granted a waiver. This plan must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on
site or off site and, if on site, the general location and type of practices.
   The stormwater management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to all other
interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater
management plan. This final plan must be signed by a licensed professional
engineer (PE) who will verify that the design of all stormwater management
practices meet the submittal requirements. No building, grading, or sediment
control permit shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management
plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by
the village building and zoning officer after determining that the plan or
waiver is consistent with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Stormwater Management Concept Plan Requirements: A stormwater
management concept plan shall be required with all permit applications for
sites 5.0 acres or greater in size, and will include sufficient information
(e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental
characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed
development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and
the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing
stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this conceptual
planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures
necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management
of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the
following information shall be included in the concept plan:
      1.   A map (or maps) indicating the location of existing and proposed
buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural stormwater management
and sediment control facilities. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed
land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to
various uses, drainage patterns, locations of utilities, roads and easements,
the limits of clearing and grading, a written description of the site plan and
justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required;
      2.   Sufficient engineering analysis to show that the proposed stormwater
management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in
compliance with this chapter and the specifications of the "Illinois Urban
Manual" or other criteria acceptable to the village;
      3.   A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the site
and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project and
a description of the watershed and its relation to the project site. This
description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover,
topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site. Particular
attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide
particular opportunities or constraints for development;
      4.   A written description of the required maintenance burden for any
proposed stormwater management facility; and
      5.   The village may also require a concept plan to consider the maximum
development potential of a site under existing zoning, regardless of whether
the applicant presently intends to develop the site to its maximum potential.
   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed site,
an applicant shall be required to include within the stormwater concept plan
measures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges from the site in
accordance with the standards of this chapter to the maximum extent
practicable.
   C.   Final Stormwater Management Plan Requirements: After review of the
stormwater management concept plan, and modifications to that plan as deemed
necessary by the village, a final stormwater management plan must be submitted
for approval. The final stormwater management plan, in addition to the
information from the concept plan, shall include all of the information
required by this chapter. This includes:

   D.   Performance Bond/Security: The village may, at its discretion, require
the submittal of a performance security in the form of a letter of credit prior
to issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater practices are
installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater
management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be
the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices
approved under the permit, plus twenty five percent (25%). The performance
security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work
specified in the stormwater management plan.
   The installation performance security shall be released in full only upon
submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a registered
professional engineer that the stormwater practice has been installed in
accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this
chapter. The village will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to
ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of
this chapter. Provisions for a partial pro rata release of the performance
security based on the completion of various development stages can be arranged
at the discretion of the village. (Ord. 2009-05, 1-27-2009)

address the deterioration, crime, and decline in value of Village neighborhoods
caused by property with foreclosing or foreclosed mortgages located within the
Village, and to identify, regulate, limit and reduce the number of these
properties located within the Village. It has been determined that Owner-
occupied structures are generally better maintained when compared to vacant
structures, even with a diligent off-site property Owner. Vacant structures or
structures owned by individuals who are economically strained and unable to
meet their mortgage obligations are often not properly or diligently
maintained, which contribute to blight, declined property values, and have a
negative impact on social perception of the residential areas where they are
located. It is the Board of Trustees’ further intent to establish a
registration program as a mechanism to help protect neighborhoods from becoming
blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance of properties that are in
Foreclosure or Foreclosed, and to provide a mechanism to avert foreclosure
actions through timely intervention, education, or counseling of property
Owners. (Ord. 2021-32, 12-21-2021)

4-17-6: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater.
   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the
storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      1.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter:
         a.   Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape
irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater,
groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater,
foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering
systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (of dechlorinated - typically less than 1 ppm chlorine),
firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
         b.   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
         c.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the public works department prior to the time of the test.
      2.   The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental
protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue. (Ord. 2016-14, 3-22-2016)
4-17-7: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The SPW
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
village will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
The violator may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing.
   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the SPW.
(Ord. 2016-14, 3-22-2016)
4-17-8: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the SPW
prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Ord. 2016-14, 3-22-2016)
4-17-9: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The representatives of the SPW shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the SPW.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the representations of the SPW ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
      3.   The representatives of the SPW shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The representatives of the SPW have the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the representatives of the SPW and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the representatives of the SPW
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the representatives of the SPW reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized
or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the representatives of the SPW have been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord.

any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevent plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 2016-14,
3-22-2016)
4-17-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2016-14, 3-22-2016)
4-17-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the SPW within three (3) business days of the
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3)
years. (Ord. 2016-14, 3-22-2016)
4-17-13: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Notice Of Violation: Whenever the SPW finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:

      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs.
   B.   The Implementation Of Source Control Or Treatment BMPs: If abatement of
a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice
shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be
completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to
remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by
a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall
be charged to the violator. (Ord. 2016-14, 3-22-2016)
4-17-14: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
SPW. The notice of appeal must be submitted in writing to the village president
within five (5) days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the
appeal before the village board shall take place at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the village board from the date of receipt of the notice
of appeal. The decision of the village board shall be final. (Ord. 2016-14, 3-
22-2016)
4-17-15: ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL:
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within seven (7)
days of the decision of the village board upholding the decision of the SPW,
then representatives of the SPW shall enter upon the subject private property
and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person,

4-19-1-1: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for Users of the POTW for the
Village of Minooka and enables the Village to comply with all applicable State
and Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code [USC]
section 1219 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (Title 40 CFR
Part 403). The objectives of this Ordinance are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of Pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
   B.   To prevent the introduction of Pollutants into the POTW that will Pass
Through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   C.   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by air, Wastewater,
and Biosolids in the course of their employment and the general public;
   D.   To improve opportunities to reduce Wastewater and reclaim Biosolids and
effluent from the POTW;
   E.   To enable the Village to comply with its NPDES permit conditions,
Biosolids use and disposal requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to
which the POTW is subject; and
   F.   To provide for fees for equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW and provides for the
enforcement of general requirements for users. The ordinance authorizes the
issuance of individual wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring,
compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review
procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the programs established
herein.

                A.   Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is (or may
                be) a Discharge of Pollutants, the construction of which commenced after the
                publication of proposed Pretreatment Standards under Section 307 (c) of the Clean
                Water Act which will be applicable to such source if such standards are thereafter
                promulgated in accordance with that section, provided that one of the following is
                true:
                   1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at a site
                on which no other source is located;
                   2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces the

                   3.   The production or Wastewater-generating processes of the building, structure,
                facility, or installations are substantially independent of an Existing Source at the
                same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such
                as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and
                the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity
                as the Existing Source should be considered.
                B.   Construction on a site at which an Existing Source is located results in a
                modification rather than a New Source if the construction does not create a new
NEW SOURCE:     building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of parts (A)(1)
                or (A)(2) above but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to the existing process or
                production equipment.
                C.   Construction of a New Source as defined under this paragraph has commenced if
                the owner or operator has done one of the following:
                   1.   Begun or caused one of the following to begin as part of a continuous onsite
                construction program:
                      a.   Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment; or
                      b.   Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation, or
                removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary for the

                   2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities
                or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable time.
                Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without
                substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do
                not constitute a contractual obligation under this paragraph.
                   3.   New Sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall "start-
                up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable Pretreatment
                Standards before beginning to Discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to
                exceed ninety (90) days), New Sources shall meet all applicable standards.

      3.   In addition to the Wastewater Survey required above, a User which
has the potential to be classified as a CIU shall be required to complete a
category-specific survey that identifies sub-processes and processes performed
at the site in order to define which sub-processes and processes are regulated
by an USEPA Effluent Guideline category. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-2-2: STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR SEWER USE:
   A.   Upon determination by the village, a user may be required to install
any of the following structures or facilities, supplemented by plans,
specifications, and other information considered necessary in the judgment of
the Coordinator. Such structures and facilities shall be installed and
maintained at all times at the user's sole cost and expense. Monitoring
facilities, flow metering devices, sampling equipment, and documentation of the
frequency of sampling, sampling methods, and analysis of samples shall be
subject, at all reasonable times, to inspection by the village.
      1.   Monitoring Manhole. All Users Are required to install a monitoring
manhole for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with
the plans and specifications approved by the village. Each manhole shall be
situated on the user's premises in an easement dedicated to the village.
      The monitoring manhole shall be located on the Building Sewer at a point
where there are no changes in grade or alignment for at least fifteen (15) pipe
diameters upstream and downstream from the manhole. The slope of the pipe shall
not exceed one percent (1%) (one (1) foot per one hundred (100) feet) through
the manhole and for a distance of fifteen (15) pipe diameters upstream and
fifteen (15) pipe diameters downstream from the manhole.
      The monitoring manhole shall be installed upstream of the Village Sewer
at a distance approved by the Village.
      There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring manhole to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The manhole shall be
installed and maintained by the owner and/or user at its sole cost and expense
and shall be safe and accessible to the village at all times. The failure of a
user to keep its monitoring manhole in good working order shall not be grounds
for the user to claim that sample results are not representative of its
discharge.
         a.   All Users are required to install a monitoring manhole for each
separate discharge of a building sewer into the public sewer with the plans and
specifications approved by the village.
         b.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist at
an existing building:
            (1)   If the user is classified as an SIU or an NSRU, the User
shall install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use as the local
limits regulatory sampling location along the building sewer, in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by the village. A sampling chamber may
be required to be installed within the building.
            (2)   If the User is classified as a CIU, the User shall install a
monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use as the regulatory sampling
location of the categorically regulated discharge in the building sewer in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village. This sampling
chamber may be required to be installed within the building and may be in
addition to an end-of-pipe manhole.
            (3)   Under certain circumstances, at the discretion and approval
of the Coordinator, the user may be permitted to construct a monitoring point
within the user's facility to serve either as an end-of-process monitoring
point or an end-of-pipe monitoring point. A monitoring point within the
building shall be accessible to the village for necessary sampling and
observation.
            (4)   Under certain circumstances and at the discretion of the
Coordinator, the village may consider the monitoring manhole location to be
either the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer from the point at
which the building sewer is connected or the point of process wastewater
discharge if accessible by the village.
         c.   The failure of a user to maintain its monitoring manhole in good
working order shall not be grounds for a user to assert that the sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.
         d.   Where such a monitoring manhole location would be impractical or
cause extreme hardship on the user, the village may permit the monitoring
manhole to be constructed in the public right of way provided the monitoring
manhole is located so that it shall not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. If a monitoring manhole is located in a parking lot, permanent
barricades shall be placed around the monitoring manhole to prevent vehicles
from driving or parking over the monitoring manhole cover.
         e.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may determine sub-classes of
business that do not require the installation of a monitoring manhole;
provided, however, monitoring manholes shall be required in zoned business or
industrial parks.
         f.   If the User is one tenant in a multi-tenant building, the User
shall either install a monitoring manhole particular to their discharge or
perform a village-approved sampling study to determine the pollutant loading
from all other users contributing to the building monitoring manhole. The
approval to proceed with the initial sampling study does not absolve the user
from the requirement to install a monitoring manhole. The Coordinator may waive
the requirement to install a monitoring manhole contingent upon the quality and
conclusions of the sampling study. Once the waiver is granted, alternative
Pollutant limits shall be calculated using the Combined Wastestream Formula
methodology for the User to which the waiver was granted.
      2.   Liquid Quantity Measurements. All Significant Industrial Users and
Users subject to Wastewater surcharges may be required to install an open
channel flow measuring device in the monitoring manhole. When required, the
sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus, Parshall flume, or equivalent,
unless a weir or similar device is approved by the Village.
      The village may, at its option, based on the water usage and/or waste
loadings, require the user to install a device with a recording and totalizing
register for measurement of the liquid quantity. The device shall include a
recorder, suitable to display at a minimum seven (7) calendar days of flow at a
time. The equipment required to indicate, record, and totalize the flow shall
be located in a warm dry location and be accessible to the village for reading.
This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at the user's sole
cost and expense. The user shall complete installation of the flow measurement
device and secondary flow measuring device based on the installation schedule
approved for such device by the village.
      The User shall be required to calibrate and maintain the flow metering
equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures and
frequencies. Users who operate flow measuring devices shall submit the
procedure for operation and maintenance to the Pretreatment Coordinator. The
user shall further document operations and maintenance in a log which shall be
available for inspection by authorized agents of the village. At a minimum, the
user shall submit a semi-annual calibration report performed by an outside
representative by the deadline defined in the user's discharge permit. The user
may be required to submit flow records to the Pretreatment Coordinator monthly.
      3.   Sampling Equipment. The Village may, at its option, based on water
usage and/or waste loadings or when the waste loads cannot be accurately
evaluated by timed composite samples, require the user to install sampling
equipment. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at the
user's sole cost and expense.
      Users shall submit the procedure for operations and maintenance of the
sampling equipment to the Pretreatment Coordinator. The User shall further
document operations and maintenance in a log which shall be available for
inspection by authorized agents of the village. At minimum, the user shall
submit a semi-annual report confirming the accurate operation of the equipment
performed by an outside representative by the deadline defined in the
wastewater discharge permit.
      The failure of a user to maintain its sampling equipment in good working
order shall not be grounds for a user to assert that the sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      4.   Garbage Grinders. Garbage is required to be properly shredded in
order to be approved to be discharged to the public sewer. Wastes classified as
properly shredded garbage contain all particles being carried freely under the
flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particle greater
than one-half inch (1.27 centimeters) in any dimension. The installation and
operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths
horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to review and approval
of the Building Department. Garbage grinders are prohibited to be connected to
a grease interceptor.
      5.   FOG and/or Sand Interceptors. Interceptors shall be provided in
facilities connected to the Public Sewer where it is determined that they are
necessary for the proper handling Wastewater that contains excessive amounts of
FOG or sand, except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity
approved by the building department and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. FOG and sand interceptors used for
petroleum grease and oils may be located inside the building. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at
its sole cost and expense. (Ord. 2020- 33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-2-3: GREASE SEPARATION:
The Coordinator may require Users, specifically any User which Discharges FOG,
or any derivative of fat, oil, or grease, into the POTW to comply with the
following requirements. Inspections of Users will determine the potential for
adverse impact to the POTW. Facilities determined to have the potential to
adversely impact the POTW will be subject to the requirements found in Chapter
18. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)

to the POTW. All users with prohibited wastes described in this section or
those that have hazardous wastes shall develop and implement a Spill/Slug
Control (SSC) Plan consistent with the requirements in Section
4-19-4-4. The Pretreatment Coordinator may also determine that a SSC Plan is
required for liquids and solids not previously described in plans based on an
evaluation of a site potential to cause spills or slug loads to be introduced
to the POTW.
   D.   Discharge of Unpolluted Drainage into Storm Sewers or Natural Outlets:
Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers
as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved

discharged, upon approval of the IEPA, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
   E.   Discharge of Unpolluted Waters Upon Adjacent Property or Public Streets
or Ways Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge in such
manner as to cause such waters to overflow onto adjacent property or to be
discharged upon any public street or public way, any stormwater, surface water,
ground water, roof runoff, or subsurface drainage, including the use of a sump
pump for such purpose.
   Any Person violating any of the provisions of this section shall, upon
conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor and the Coordinator may assess a
fine of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day and/or be
incarcerated in a penal institution other than a penitentiary for not to exceed
six (6) months. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during
or on which such person, firm, or corporation violates the provisions of this
section. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-3-3: NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
All Users subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, promulgated
by the USEPA in accordance with Section 307(b) and (c) of the Act, currently
discharging or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall comply with all
pretreatment standards and requirements. Limits in categorical pretreatment
standards apply to the discharge from the process regulated by the standard or
as otherwise specified by the standard. The National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards set forth in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405 - 471, are
hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter.
   A.   Where a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a Pollutant in Wastewater, the
Coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits, unless
specifically restricted by the Standard, in accordance with parts E and F below
in this section.
   The calculated equivalent limitations are deemed pretreatment standards.
Users shall be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in place of
the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations
were derived. An alternative pretreatment limit shall not be used if the
alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the
regulated pollutants.
   B.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Coordinator may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed as either mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users.
   The Coordinator calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall
calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the
user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be
based on a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term daily production
during a representative year and not based on design production capacity. For
new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.
   The Coordinator shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass
limitations by the average daily flow rate of the user's regulated process
wastewater. The average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable
measure of the user's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average
daily flow rate during the representative year.
   C.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard prior to any pretreatment,
the Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the Combined Waste Stream
Formula set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(e), provided that the applicable categorical
regulation allows the Wastewaters to be mixed and the User can supply the
information necessary to allow issuance of an alternative limit.
   D.   A user may request an adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard
to account for pollutant loadings in the user's intake water (a net/gross
adjustment) in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   E.   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the village convert the
limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration
limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Coordinator. The Village
may establish equivalent mass limits only if the User meets all the conditions
set forth in parts 1.a. through 1.e. below.
      1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the User must:
         a.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its
Wastewater Discharge Permit;
         b.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         c.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
         d.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to
control the discharge; and
         e.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for
equivalent mass limits.
      2.   A User subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         a.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         b.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         c.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty
percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph 1.c.
of this Section. Upon notification of a revised baseline production rate, the
Coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as
necessary to reflect revised baseline production rates at the facility; and
         d.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph 1(a) of
this Section so long as it Discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      3.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Coordinator:
         a.   Shall calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         b.   Shall reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the
limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility upon notification
of a revised production rate from the User; and
         c.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
Wastewater Discharge Permit terms if the User's actual average daily flow rate
was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation
methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the
original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of
dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
4-19-3-7. The user must also be in compliance with Section
4-19-14-3 regarding the prohibition of Bypass.
   F.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
Categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual Users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Coordinator.
   G.   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
   H.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four (4)-day average, limitations.
Where such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure
shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent
limitations.
   I.   Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Coordinator within two (2) business days after the
User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User which fails to
timely notify the Coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its wastewater discharge permit that
were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.
   J.   A User may request a variance from USEPA based on fundamentally
different factors. The request must comply with the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
   All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards
are required to file reports as required Sections
4-19-7-2 and
4-19-7-3, signed by an authorized representative. Such reports shall include
all information that the Coordinator deems necessary to make compliance
determinations. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-3-4: STATE LIMITS:
All users are subject to state water quality standards and requirements as set
forth in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 307 and any future amendments or revisions to 35
Ill. Adm. Code 307. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-3-5: LOCAL LIMITS:
   A.   The Coordinator is authorized to establish Local Limits pursuant to 40
CFR 403.5(c).
   B.   The following Pollutant limits are established to protect against Pass
Through and Interference. No Person shall Discharge Wastewater containing in
excess of the following Local Limits.
Pollutant Local Limit Concentration (mg/L)
          Daily Maximum Limit Instantaneous Limit
Pollutant               Local Limit Concentration (mg/L)
                        Daily Maximum Limit Instantaneous Limit
Ammonia-Nitrogen (As N) 150                  
BOD                     2,000                
FOG (Food Origin)                          200
FOG (Mineral/Petroleum)                    100
Mercury                 0.0005               
pH                                         5.0 - 9.5
Phosphorus (As P)       25                   
TSS                     2,000                
 
   The above limits apply at the point where Wastewater is Discharged to the
POTW. All concentrations of metallic substances are for total metal unless
otherwise indicated. FOG shall be measured as defined in 40 CFR 136 Table 1B
Parameter 41.
   C.   If deemed appropriate by the Coordinator, and if POTW capacity and
loading allows, alternative limits may be developed for permitted Users using
the Non-Uniform Allocation methodology presented in the United States
Environmental Protection Agency's "Local Limits Development Guidance" (July,
2004). These Non-Uniform Allocation (NUA) Limits shall be written into the
Permit issued to the User and shall operate in place of the Local Limit for the
aforementioned Pollutants described in division (C) above.
   D.   Best Management Practices (BMP): The Coordinator may develop BMPs by
Ordinance or in individual Wastewater Discharge Permits to implement Local
Limits and the requirements contained in Section
4-19-3-2 of this chapter. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-3-6: VILLAGE'S RIGHT OF REVISION:
   A.   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent limitations or requirements on
discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter. The
specific limitations on discharges are derived from the maximum allowable
industrial loading (MAIL) calculation. The MAILs are allocated only to those
users, at the village's discretion, that contribute the regulated pollutant.
All remaining users are held to either the background concentration or slightly
higher than background but lower than the specific discharge limit. In no case
shall the sum of allocations exceed the MAIL.
   B.   The village will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks
pollutant loading for each pollutant for new industries or increase of
pollutant loading from existing industries. The Village will recalculate the
maximum concentrations from time to time using site specific data and will
consider revisions to State and Federal regulations that may impact the
calculations. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-3-7: DILUTION PROHIBITED:
No user shall increase the use of potable or process water or in any other way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment in order to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable
pretreatment standard. The Coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements,
or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord.
2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4: GENERAL DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE:
4-19-4-1: APPLICABILITY:
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to
the POTW which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated
in Section
4-19-3-2, or which are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided
in 40 CFR 403, and any amendments thereto, or which in the judgment of the
Village may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may reject the wastes, require pretreatment to an
acceptable condition for discharge to the POTW, or require control over the
quantities or rates of discharge. If the Coordinator permits the pretreatment
or equalization of wastewater flows, the design and installation of the
facilities and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Coordinator and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances, and laws.
Each user that discharges wastewater to the POTW shall provide wastewater
treatment and best management practices as required to comply with this chapter
and shall comply with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and
the prohibitions set forth in Section
4-19-5 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by USEPA, the
State, or the Pretreatment Coordinator, whichever is more stringent. (Ord.
2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4-2: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Any pretreatment facility(s) necessary for compliance shall be provided and
shall be properly maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the user at the user's sole cost and expense. Detailed plans and
specifications describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Coordinator for review and approval prior to the construction
and operation of such facilities. The review of such plans and specifications
shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
All Users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements. A User
shall file an IEPA application for a construction-operating permit prior to
construction or significant modification of a Pretreatment system that has been
signed-off by the Village and obtain either a permit from the IEPA or a letter
indicating no permit is needed prior to the village connection and/or
wastewater discharge permit(s) being issued. No sources of non-residential
wastewater shall be discharged to the POTW until all permitting requirements
have been satisfied. All pretreatment facilities designated by the Coordinator
shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater
operator even if the User is not issued an IEPA operating permit.
Any subsequent proposed modification, alteration, or change to the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be submitted to the village and IEPA
for review and approval prior to the user's initiation of the changes. Users
shall obtain all necessary additional construction-operating permits from IEPA
and the Village for the changes prior to making said modification, alteration,
or change. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4-3: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
The village may require the additional pretreatment measures set forth below.
The village reserves the right to make unannounced inspections of any
additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours whether or not
the user has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit.
   A.   Whenever deemed Necessary, the coordinator may require a user to
restrict its discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific public sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and make other such actions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The Coordinator may require any user discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on its property and at its sole cost and expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. This
device shall be approved by the Coordinator. The village may issue an
individual or general wastewater discharge permit solely for flow equalization.
   C.   The Coordinator may require a user discharging to the POTW to install
and maintain facilities to limit the amount of FOG and sand entering the POTW
through the procedures outlined in Section
4-19-2-2.
   D.   The Coordinator may require a user with the potential to discharge
flammable substances to the POTW to install and maintain, on its property and
at its own cost and expense, a combustible gas detection meter. This meter
shall be approved by the Coordinator.
   E.   The village retains the right to negotiate a surcharge with a user
discharging high strength waste, the dollar amount to be determined based on
the strength, character and volume of the waste.
While performing the necessary work on private properties, the Coordinator,
duly authorized employees of the Village, consultants retained by the Village,
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the user, and the user shall be held harmless for injury to or
death of the village employees, and the village shall indemnify the user
against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the user, except as such may be caused by negligence or
failure of the user to maintain safe conditions. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4-4: SPILL/SLUG CONTROL PLAN:
   A.   A User shall develop, implement and maintain a SSC Plan if the User
has:
      1.   Chemicals (raw materials, chemical intermediates, wastes to be
recycled, final products, or utility chemicals) that total or exceed two
hundred fifty (250) gallons or five (5) 55-gallon drums at or on its site;
      2.   Prohibited Discharge Materials as defined in Section
4-19-3-2 at or on its site; or
      3.   Hazardous Waste as defined in Section
4-19-7-8 at or on its site; or
      4.   Been defined by the Pretreatment Coordinator to have a need to
control slug discharges.
      Any user that meets the above criteria shall develop and implement a SSC
Plan regardless of whether or not that user is regulated by a wastewater
discharge permit.
   B.   The SSC Plan which is required to be submitted to the village shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      1.   Specifics of SSC Plan:
         a.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
         b.   Description of stored chemicals, including quantity, type, and
number of storage containers;
         c.   Site diagram showing location of all tanks holding greater than
or equal to two hundred and fifty (250) gallons or areas containing five (5)
fifty-five (55)-gallon drums or more of raw materials, prohibited wastes,
hazardous wastes, wastes to be recycled, or final product;
         d.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge. Such procedures shall include, but are not limited to, routine
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
measures specific to slug Discharge control, worker training, building of
containment structures or equipment, inventory of spill response equipment,
measures for containing toxic organic Pollutants, including solvents, and
measures and equipment for emergency response. Building containment structures
or production equipment changes are considered procedures to prevent adverse
spills. If containment structures are connected to the POTW, a shut-off valve
is required and shall be left in a closed position;
         e.   Location of Notice/Signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English, and the language of common use at the facility, whom to
call in the event of a spill, accidental Discharge of prohibited materials,
Slug Discharge, or a Bypass of any part of a Pretreatment system; and
         f.   Emergency telephone number(s) (twenty-four (24)-hour) off-site
and backup telephone number(s) and other contact information (e.g. address,
email address, etc.) for responsible site staff. Once a SSC Plan has been filed
with the Village, any change in such information should be submitted within
five (5) work days after revision.
      2.   Notification Procedure. The SSC Plan shall contain procedures for
immediately notifying the Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental or Slug
Discharge, as required by Section
4-19-7-6 of this chapter;
      3.   Documentation. The SSC Plan shall contain a sample of the
documentation maintained at the site that:
         a.   Ensures that all employees who are in a position to cause,
discover, or observe such Discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedures and the training is documented with the date and time of training
and the employee's signature; and
         b.   Verifies inspection and maintenance procedures to prevent adverse
impacts and confirm that said procedures are being performed on a regular
basis. At minimum, logs are required to verify valves in containment
structures, if present, are closed.
   C.   The SSC Plan shall be submitted to the Coordinator when the plan is
required in a wastewater discharge permit. Review of an SSC Plan by the village
shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's
facility or SSC Plan as necessary to meet all requirements of this chapter.
Review by the Village does not constitute an approval of the SSC Plan and the
village and its duly authorized agent(s) are not responsible for the actions of
the user and any impacts the user may cause as a result of a spill or slug
load.
   D.   At least once every two (2) years the Coordinator shall require each
SIU (including CIUs) to evaluate the need to revise its SSC Plan. The
Coordinator may require any user to submit, at a frequency less than two (2)
years, such SSC Plan or require modification of an existing SSC Plan based on
changes that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident that had
the potential to impact the POTW.
   In alternate years, the Coordinator shall evaluate whether each NSRU is
required to file a revision to its SSC Plan based on changes that have occurred
at the site or in response to an incident that had the potential to impact the
POTW.
   E.   All SSC Plans shall be implemented by the user whether or not they have
been reviewed by the village. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4-5: MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Flow Monitoring: All permitted users are required to monitor flow of
potable water and/or wastewater at frequency stated in the user's wastewater
discharge permit. All other users are required to flow monitor upon the request
of the village.
      1.   Metered water supply may be used to determine Wastewater flow if it
is substantiated to the Village that the metered water supply and Wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
Pretreatment Coordinator is made in the metered water supply to determine
Wastewater flow and is documented through the use of sub-meters and/or
production records. In the event that the Wastewater flow cannot be
substantiated at any regulated location, the user shall be required to install
flow monitoring consistent with Section
4-19-2-2.
         a.   In the event the Village, or surrounding area, should suffer from
a water shortage, the Village Board of Minooka shall have the authority to
suspend the provisions of the paragraph above in order to encourage water
conservation. In the event that the President of the Village of Minooka
determines and declares that such water shortage exists to such an extent and
degree as to constitute an emergency, then the Village President shall have the
authority to suspend the provisions of the paragraph above, pending
ratification by the Village Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting
following the suspension by the Village President. In determining whether a
water shortage exists, the Village President and Village Board may consider
water shortages in the surrounding area in addition to the adequacy of the
supply of the Village Water System. In the event that a future water shortage
appears evident, the provisions of the paragraph above may also be suspended by
the Village President or Village Board prior to the existence of an emergency.
      2.   Under authorization from the Village, users may be permitted to
install additional water meters on the exterior of the user's structure at the
user's sole cost and expense for the purpose of measuring water not Discharged
to the POTW. All users shall register with the Village and provide information
requested by the Village concerning the installation of additional water
meters. The Building Official shall have the right to inspect and regulate the
installation of additional water meters. The Wastewater volume Discharged to
the POTW shall be determined by subtracting the volume shown on the additional
water meter(s) from the total metered amount of water supplied to the premises.
   B.   Wastewater Discharge Sampling: All permitted users are required to
sample based on the monitoring frequency as stated in the user's wastewater
discharge permit. Other users are required to sample upon the request of the
village. A user shall pay the cost of sampling of its discharge and the cost of
analyses of its samples, whether or not the sampling and analyses are performed
by the user or by the village.
      1.   Sample Frequency
         a.   All SIUs (including CIUs) shall sample their effluent(s) for the
parameters specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit and report the
results to the coordinator at a minimum of at least twice per year or more
frequently as designated in the permit. The village shall have the right to
perform its own sampling for any pollutant at any time.
         b.   Any NSRUs with a wastewater discharge permit shall sample their
effluent and report the results to the coordinator in a manner consistent with
the requirements of the wastewater discharge permit.
         c.   The sampling frequency listed in a Wastewater Discharge Permit
may be modified by the Coordinator in the event that additional samples are
needed to demonstrate consistent compliance.
      2.   Sample Collection
         a.   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements shall be
based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative
of conditions occurring during the reporting period as defined in the
wastewater discharge permit.
         b.   Except as indicated in paragraph c. below, the user shall collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques.
         c.   In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the
Coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling, at minimum
collecting samples every fifteen (15) minutes during a twenty-four (24)-hour
workday, or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that
this will provide a representative sample of the wastewater being discharged. A
proportional number of samples shall be collected for wastewater discharges
less than twenty-four (24) hours.
         d.   One or more grab samples may be required by the Coordinator in
the event of an infrequent batch discharge or to show compliance with
pretreatment standards, including daily maximum pretreatment standards. The
Coordinator may also allow, during an infrequent batch discharge, multiple grab
samples to be collected and composited, as appropriate, to determine compliance
with daily maximum pretreatment standards. Grab samples may not be composited
to determine compliance with instantaneous local limits.
         e.   Samples for FOG, temperature, pH, cyanide, chromium (VI),
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using the
number of grab samples determined by the Coordinator to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. Multiple grab samples that
are individually preserved as specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate USEPA
guidance that are collected during a twenty-four (24)-hour period must not be
composited and must be analyzed separately to determine compliance with
instantaneous local limits. However, results may be averaged to determine
compliance with the pollutant's respective daily maximum limit, when
applicable.
         f.   To determine compliance with daily maximum limits only, samples
for the following pollutants may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows:
            (1)   For, cyanide, chromium (VI), phenols, and sulfides: multiple
grab samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
            (2)   For volatile organics and FOG: multiple grab samples may only
be composited in the laboratory.
         g.   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved USEPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Coordinator, as appropriate. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4-6: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
Pollutant in question, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the Pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or
any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the Coordinator or other parties approved by USEPA.
   B.   Analytical reports submitted to the Village must comply with the
following requirements:
      1.   The practical quantification limit (PQL) must be less than half of
the effluent limit for the Pollutant being analyzed;
      2.   The analysis method used, method detection limit (MDL), and the PQL
must be listed for each Pollutant analyzed;
      3.   Results which were not detected by the analysis must be reported as
“Not Detected,” or “ND,” or “<[MDL]”, or equal;
      4.   Results which were detected by the analysis at or above the MDL, but
the result was not quantifiable, must be reported as the concentration detected
and noted in the report as “Detected Not Quantifiable,” or “DNQ,” or using an
appropriate qualifier and footnote description; and
      5.   If a result is detected, it must be reported. Failure to report a
detected result constitutes significant noncompliance.
   C.   As the Coordinator deems necessary, a user may be required to analyze
for one or more pollutants not listed in the local limits or pretreatment
standards to satisfy the requirements of this chapter.
   Documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods, and analysis
of samples shall be subject, at all reasonable times, to inspection by the
village. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-4-7: PROTECTION OF VILLAGE SAMPLING AND FLOW METERING EQUIPMENT FROM
DAMAGE:
No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy,
or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which is owned or
contracted by the village. Any person violating this provision shall be subject
to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-
2020)
4-19-4-8: CLOSURE PLAN:
   A.   Any user meeting the requirements of Section
4-19-4-4 that decides to cease or terminate any operations which classify the
user as an SIU, for more than ninety (90) days, must file a written closure
plan with the village. The closure plan shall be submitted ten (10) work days
prior to the initiation of the plan and shall contain, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   A description of each wastewater generating process that will cease
operations for more than ninety (90) consecutive days;
      2.   A description of how the facility will be closed and the extent of
operations during the closure period;
      3.   An inventory and estimate of the volume of all process wastewater,
chemicals, and hazardous waste on site. A description of the methods for
disposal, including procedures for removing, transporting, treating, storing,
or disposing of all waste and identifying all off-site waste management
facilities to be used;
      4.   A schedule of the closure activities indicating the time required to
complete each closure step; and
      5.   A schedule of additional monitoring to identify compliance with
pretreatment standards during the closure operations. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-
2020)
4-19-5: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION:
4-19-5-1: WASTEWATER INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS:
A user shall submit information on the nature and characteristics of its
Wastewater within a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days of a written request
by the Coordinator. Information shall be submitted on a form provided by the
Village. The Pretreatment Coordinator may periodically require users to update
information on file with the Village. Information that may be required will be
consistent with the information identified in Section
4-19-2-1 and Section
4-19-3.
Users classified as CIUs shall complete and submit a Baseline Monitoring Report
with a Permit Application and also comply with the other requirements in
Section
4-19-7-2 of this chapter. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-5-2: AUTHORITY AND REQUIREMENTS:
The Coordinator may issue a user a wastewater discharge permit as follows:
   A.   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permits issued to SIUs (which includes
CIUs not identified as NSCIUs): No SIU, including any CIU, shall Discharge
Wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a Wastewater Discharge Permit
issued by the Village, except that an existing SIU that has filed a timely
application pursuant to Section
4-19-5-3 may continue to discharge for the time period specified herein.
   B.   General Wastewater Discharge Permits. At the discretion of the
Coordinator, the village may issue a general wastewater discharge permit to
control discharges from users to the POTW if the following conditions are true
of all facilities controlled by a general wastewater discharge permit:
      1.   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
      2.   Discharge the same types of waste;
      3.   Require the same effluent limitations or Best Management Practices;
      4.   Require the same or similar monitoring and/or reporting
requirements; and
      5.   In the opinion of the Coordinator, are more appropriately controlled
under a general Wastewater Discharge Permit than under an individual Wastewater
Discharge Permit.
   C.   Other Wastewater Discharge Permits: The Coordinator may require other
users to obtain either individual or general Wastewater Discharge Permits, as
necessary, to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Such a Wastewater
Discharge Permit shall state that the holder of such a Permit issued under this
section is not classified as an SIU or CIU. A user with a Wastewater Discharge
Permit in this class may include but are not limited to:
      1.   Any user that has been determined to be a NSCIU as defined in
Section 19.106;
      2.   Any user that has been determined not to be an SIU as defined in
Section 19.106;
      3.   Any user subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards that
opts not to Discharge process waste. Such a user is designated a Zero Process
Wastewater Discharge CIU and shall be issued a Zero Process Wastewater
Discharge Permit;
      4.   Any user that is a non-Categorical Zero Process Wastewater
Discharger that the Coordinator determines shall be permitted;
      5.   Any Non-Significant Regulated users (NSRU) set forth below:
         a.   An NSRU that Discharges a process Wastewater flow greater than or
equal to 0.005 percent of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic capacity, or
five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller;
         b.   An NSRU that Discharges more than or equal to 0.005 percent of
the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW;
         c.   An NSRU that Discharges 0.005 percent of the maximum allowable
headworks loading for any Pollutant regulated by a Local Limit set forth in
Section
4-19-3-5; or
         d.   An NSRU that intermittently introduces any Batch Discharges that
would meet the criteria in 1, 2, or 3 above when Discharged or otherwise have
the potential to Discharge a Slug Load to the POTW;
      6.   Any user that has device(s) installed to remove oils, grease, sand,
or grit;
      7.   Any Food Service Establishments (FSE); and
      8.   Any user required to eliminate or control specified Pollutants from
its Wastewater through the development and implementation of a Best Management
Practice (BMP) Plan.
A scenario may arise that a user that is subject to National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards opts not to discharge categorical process waste, as
described in part 3 above, but the user is classified as significant. A
combination SIU Permit/Zero Process Wastewater Discharge Permit should be
issued in this case.
Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
subject the user to the sanctions set out in Sections
4-19-13 through
4-19-15 of this chapter. Obtaining an individual or general Wastewater
Discharge Permit does not relieve a user of its obligation to comply with all
Federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of Federal, state, and local law. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-5-3: EXISTING CONNECTIONS:
   A.   Any existing SIU, including CIU, required to obtain a Wastewater
Discharge Permit that was Discharging Wastewater into the POTW prior to the
effective date of this chapter and wishes to continue such Discharges in the
future, shall, within sixty (60) calendar days after said date, apply to the
Coordinator for the appropriate Wastewater Discharge Permit in accordance with
Section
4-19-5-5 of this chapter, and shall not cause or allow Discharges to the POTW
to continue after one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the effective date
of this chapter except in accordance with a Wastewater Discharge Permit issued
by the Coordinator.
   B.   Any existing non-SIU required to obtain an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall file an application within the time period
specified in a notification provided by the Coordinator.
   C.   General Permits for Food Service Establishments (FSE). FSE users shall
submit information required by the Village within the timeframe specified by
the Coordinator. FSE users complying with this requirement will be deemed to
have complied with the permit requirements during the implementation of this
program. The completed survey shall serve as the Wastewater Discharge Permit
Application for the FSE. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-5-4: NEW CONNECTIONS:
   A.   Any CIU proposing to begin or recommence a Discharge to the POTW must
obtain a Wastewater Discharge Permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of
such Discharge. An application, furnished by the Village, for this individual
Wastewater Discharge Permit, in accordance with Section
4-19-5-5 of this Ordinance, must be filed at least ninety (90) calendar days
prior to the date upon which any Discharge will begin or recommence.
   B.   Any non-CIU proposing to begin or recommence a Discharge to the POTW
that is required to obtain a Wastewater Discharge Permit must obtain such
Permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such Discharge, or operations
in the case of a Zero Process Wastewater Discharge CIU, in accordance with
Section
4-19-5-5 of this chapter. An application for a Wastewater Discharge Permit must
be filed at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the date upon which any

The Coordinator may require an FSE user to obtain a general Wastewater
Discharge Permit by submitting an application on a form provided by the Village
which is specific to FSE. The form may require, but is not limited to, contact
information, general business information, facility operation, kitchen
fixtures, FOG handling procedures, kitchen clean-up and water usage, grease
interceptor or alternatives used, and sampling locations. The Village may
require an FSE to comply with a BMP and the FSE shall submit documentation as
required by the Coordinator.
   D.   Categorical Monitoring Waivers:
      1.   Authority. The village may authorize a user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling
and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected
to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from
intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
user. This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are
derived from mass standards or production based standards. This waiver is
subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The monitoring waiver may only be authorized where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         b.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than
five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the
waiver can be granted for each subsequently issued wastewater discharge permit.
         c.   The monitoring waiver is non-transferable to a new owner or
operator.
         d.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
         e.   All applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of
Pretreatment Standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule
still apply.
      2.   Waiver Application Requirements
         a.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         b.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with Section
4-19-5-6 and include the certification statement in Section
4-19-5-6.
         c.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a Pollutant is not present if the USEPA approved method from 40 CFR Part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that Pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision.
      3.   Documentation and Record Retention for CIU Monitoring Waivers: Any
grant of the monitoring waiver by the Coordinator shall be included as a
condition in the user's Wastewater Discharge Permit. The reasons supporting the
waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver
shall be maintained by the Coordinator for three (3) years after expiration of
the waiver.
      4.   Monitor Waiver Requirements. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-5-6: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL APPLICATION SIGNATORIES AND CERTIFICATION:
   A.   All Wastewater Discharge Permit applications, user reports and
certification statements shall be signed by an Authorized Representative of the
user and contain the following certification statement:
   “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   B.   If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer
accurate because a different person or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the user, a new written authorization satisfying the requirements
of this section must be submitted to the Coordinator within thirty (30)
calendar days of the change. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-5-7: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DECISIONS:
The Coordinator will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information and/or documentation. Within thirty (30) calendar days
of receipt of a complete Wastewater Discharge Permit application, the
Coordinator will determine whether or not to issue a Wastewater Discharge
Permit. The Coordinator may deny any application for a Wastewater Discharge
Permit. If the Coordinator fails to act within ninety (90) calendar days, an
application for a Wastewater Discharge Permit shall be deemed to be denied.
4-19-6: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCESS:

reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge
permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered
final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
   E.   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative
wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the
Circuit Court for Will County within sixty (60) calendar days. (Ord. 2020-33,
11-24-2020)
4-19-6-4: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT MODIFICATION:
   A.   The Coordinator may modify a wastewater discharge permit for good
cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
      1.   To incorporate any new or revised Federal, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
      2.   To address substantial alterations or additions to the user's
operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of
issuance of the wastewater discharge permit;
      3.   In the event a waived pollutant is found to be present, or is
expected to be present, because of changes that occur in the user's operations;
      4.   A change in the user or POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
      5.   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the POTW, Village personnel, or the receiving waters;
      6.   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit;
      7.   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting;
      8.   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment
standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13;
      9.   To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge
permit; or
      10.   To reflect a transfer of either the facility ownership or operation
to either a new owner or operator as provided by Section
4-19-6-5.
   B.   The Coordinator will notify the user of the permit modification, and
the user may appeal the Coordinator's decision to modify the permit pursuant to
Section
4-19-6-3. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-6-5: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT TRANSFER:
A wastewater discharge permit shall not be transferred, assigned, or sold to a
new owner or new user in a different premise or to a new or different operation
in the same or different premise without the expressed written approval of the
Coordinator. If the premises are sold or otherwise transferred by the current
permitted user to a new owner or user who will maintain the operation in the
same premises, the permit held by the current permitted user and/or owner shall
be reissued by the village to the new owner and/or user as a temporary
wastewater discharge permit whether or not the current permitted user will
continue to operate the equipment at the site or the equipment is leased to
another user for its operation at the site of the current permitted user;
provided:
   A.   The new owner and/or user notified the village thirty (30) calendar
days in advance of the transaction; and
   B.   The new owner and/or user confirmed to the village, within five (5)
work days of the transaction, the completion of the date of the sale or
transfer or execution of an operating contract; and
   C.   The new owner and/or user shall apply for a new wastewater discharge
permit in accordance with this chapter within sixty (60) calendar days of the
ownership transaction date.
Failure to provide the sale/transfer notification defined in subsections A. and
B. above renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of said sale and/or
transfer date. It is further provided that the temporary wastewater discharge
permit shall only be effective for one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after
the date of sale or transfer. The village shall have the same remedies for
violation of temporary wastewater discharge permits as it has for violation of
other wastewater discharge permits. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-6-6: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REVOCATION:
The Coordinator may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause,
including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
   A.   Failure to timely notify the Coordinator of substantial changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;

   K.   Failure to complete a Wastewater survey or the Wastewater Discharge
Permit application;
   L.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business or
operation ownership of a permitted facility; or
   M.   Violation of any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or any terms of
the Wastewater Discharge Permit or this chapter.
Wastewater Discharge Permits shall be voidable by the Coordinator upon
cessation of operations or transfer of business or operation ownership. Any
existing Wastewater Discharge Permit issued to a particular user is void upon
the issuance of a new Wastewater Discharge Permit to that user.
The Coordinator will notify the user of the Permit modification, and the user
may appeal the Coordinator's decision to modify the Permit pursuant to Section
4-19-6-3. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-6-7: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT RE-ISSUANCE:
A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater
discharge permit re-issuance by submitting a complete wastewater discharge
permit application, in accordance with Section
4-19-5-5 of this chapter, a minimum of ninety (90) calendar days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 2020-33,
11-24-2020)
4-19-6-8: REGULATION OF WASTE RECEIVED FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS:
   A.   If another municipality, or user(s) located within another
municipality, contributes Wastewater to the POTW, the village shall enter into
an intergovernmental agreement with the contributing municipality or an
agreement with the contributing users(s) regarding the discharge of wastewater
to the POTW.
   B.   The village shall request the following information from the
contributing municipality or users(s) at a frequency determined by the village:
      1.   A description of the quality and quantity of wastewater discharged
to the POTW by the contributing municipality or users(s);

      3.   Such other information as the Coordinator may deem necessary.
   C.   An intergovernmental agreement required by subsection A above, shall
contain the following conditions:
      1.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt an
Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Ordinance which is at least as stringent as
this chapter and local limits which are at least as stringent as those set
forth in Section
4-19-3 of this chapter for the area to be served by the village. The
requirement shall specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as
necessary to reflect changes made to the village's ordinance or local limits.
The said agreement shall include a clause in the agreement that states the
users in the contributing municipality will abide by this chapter of the
village code.
      2.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit an updated
user inventory at a frequency determined by the village;
      3.   A provision specifying that pretreatment implementation activities,
including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and sampling, and
enforcement, will be under the jurisdiction of the Coordinator;
      4.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide the
Coordinator with access to all information and documentation that the

4-19-7: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
Each user shall comply with the reporting requirements within this chapter and
such user's wastewater discharge permit. Some reporting requirements may apply
to users that are not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit. (Ord.
2020- 33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-7-1: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-CATEGORICAL USERS:
Should the village find that a user, not subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards, does not meet pretreatment standards and/or
requirements applicable to its discharge, causes or contributes to a WWTP
interference or upset, causes pass through, or creates conditions which are
injurious to the POTW, including treatment processes, or pollutes the natural
waters within the village, its service areas, or the waters of the State of
Illinois, additional pretreatment and/or O&M shall be required of the user to
meet pretreatment standards and requirements. Such facilities as the village
may deem necessary for pretreatment of the wastewaters shall be furnished by
and at the expense of the user as a condition of the discharge of wastewater
into the POTW or to any natural water within the village service area.
   A.   Pretreatment Review: The Pretreatment Coordinator will require the user
to initiate a pretreatment review through a telephone call, letter, or
certified letter to the authorized representative of the user.
   B.   Pretreatment Initiation Meeting. A pretreatment initiation meeting
shall be held between the Coordinator and the user to discuss the problem and
the solution to said problem. If it is determined that changes in operation and
maintenance, plant modifications, and/or the installation of pretreatment
equipment shall occur to resolve noncompliance, a schedule shall be established
with events and completion deadlines agreeable to both parties to resolve the
noncompliance. If appropriate, a compliance agreement defining the agreed upon
schedule shall be sent from the village to the user. The user shall sign the
compliance agreement and return it to the Coordinator. If a schedule for
compliance acceptable to the Coordinator and the user cannot be established,
the matter will be referred for further enforcement action consistent with the
provisions of Section
4-19-11 as appropriate.
   C.   Progress Reports. Progress reports shall be filed by the user on a
schedule agreed to by the coordinator and the user concerning the completion of
major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment
standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation). In the progress report(s), the user shall
identify whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason
for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return
to the established compliance schedule.
   D.   Final Report. A final report shall be filed with the Coordinator by the
user within ninety (90) calendar days from the end of the compliance schedule
deadline to verify the success or failure or the entire schedule. The final
report will appropriate identify the steps being taken by the user to resolve
noncompliance. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-7-2: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL USERS:
In the event that either the Village, a user or IEPA determines that the user
is regulated as a Categorical Industrial user by standards and requirements
promulgated by the IEPA in accordance with Section 307 (b) and (c) of the Act,
the following reports are required to be filed by the user with the Village.
   A.   Baseline Monitoring Reports: Within either one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days after the effective date of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard,
or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR
403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing Categorical Industrial users
currently Discharging to or scheduled to Discharge to the POTW shall submit to
the Coordinator a report which contains the information listed below. At least
ninety (90) calendar days prior to commencement of its Discharge, New Sources
and sources that become CIUs subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the Coordinator a report which contains
the information listed below. A New Source shall report the method of
Pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A New
Source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
Pollutants to be Discharged.
   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below to the
Coordinator:
      1.   Identifying Information. The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.
      2.   Environmental Permits. A list of any environmental control permits
held by or for the facility.
      3.   Description of Operations. A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production, (including each product produced by type, amount,
processes, and rate of production), and standard industrial classification
(SIC) codes of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description
should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of Discharge
to the POTW from the regulated processes.
      4.   Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). The Pretreatment Coordinator may
allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or
feasibility considerations.
      5.   Measurements of Pollutants.
         a.   The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process;
         b.   The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the
categorical pretreatment standard or by the Coordinator, of regulated
pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and
average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample
shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the categorical
pretreatment standard requires a best management practice or pollution
prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the
coordinator or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the
categorical pretreatment standard;
         c.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
complete the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
A maximum of four (4) grab samples may be required to be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, chromium (VI), and volatile organic
compounds.
         d.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow the use of the combined wastestream formula
of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with all pretreatment
standards. Similar methodology may be used to evaluate limits for users that
combine wastestreams after pretreatment but before monitoring, at the
discretion of the Coordinator. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit
has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit
along with supporting data may be submitted to the USEPA or IEPA;
         e.   Sampling shall be performed in accordance with procedures set out
in Section
4-19-4-5 of this chapter and samples shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in Section
4-19-4-6 of this chapter. Where Sections
4-19-4-5 and
4-19-4-6 do not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the Coordinator determines that the listed sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any
other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Coordinator;
         f.   The Coordinator may allow the submission of a baseline monitoring
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial Pretreatment
measures;
         g.   The baseline monitoring report shall indicate the time, date and
place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected
Pollutant Discharges to the Village;
      6.   Compliance Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
Authorized Representative (as defined in Section
4-19-1-6), and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required for the CIU to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements; and
      7.   Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the user will submit the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or
O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
         a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to: hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
         b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) calendar
months;
         c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the Coordinator no
later than fourteen (14) calendar days following each date in the schedule and
the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule;
         d.   In no event shall more than nine (9) calendar months elapse
between such progress reports to the Coordinator; and
         e.   All compliance schedule progress reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section
4-19-5-6 of this chapter.
         f.   Where the user's categorical pretreatment standard has been
modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream
formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance
(40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by paragraph
(b) of this section, the information required by paragraphs A(6) and A(7) of
this section shall pertain to the modified limits.
         g.   If the Categorical Pretreatment Standard is modified by a removal
allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)),
and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the
user submits the report required by part A of this section, any necessary
amendments to the information requested by paragraphs A.6. and A(7) of this
section shall be submitted by the user to the pretreatment coordinator within
sixty (60) days after the modified limit is approved.
      8.   Signature and Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with Section
4-19-5-6 of this chapter.
   B.   Reports On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline:
Within ninety (90) calendar days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of Wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Coordinator a report containing the information described in Section
4-19-7-2(A) of this chapter. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 4-19-5-6 of
this chapter. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-7-3: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS/SELF-MONITORING REPORTS:
   A.   Significant Industrial users (Including CIUs)
      1.   SIUs shall, at a frequency determined by the Coordinator but in no
case less than twice per year (on dates specified by the village in the
wastewater discharge permit, representing the first and second semi-annual
periods) submit a report to the village with a description of the nature,
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards, and the measured or estimated average and daily flows for the
reporting period, in addition to any other reports required by the SIU's
Wastewater Discharge Permit. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section
4-19-5-6 of this chapter.
      2.   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge and comply with the
requirements of Section
4-19-4-5 and Section
4-19-4-6.
      3.   All sampling and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu of
the significant industrial user at the discretion of the Coordinator. In such
cases, the village will issue an attachment to the wastewater discharge permit
that specifies the village will perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at
minimum. The significant industrial user shall reimburse the village for all
costs and expenses incurred for such sampling and analysis in a manner
acceptable to the village.
      4.   In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a
Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the Coordinator or the Pretreatment
Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      5.   If a SIU subject to the reporting requirements in this section
monitors any Pollutant more frequently than required by the Coordinator, using
the procedures prescribed in Section
4-19-4-5 and Section
4-19-4-6 of this Ordinance, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report.
   B.   Categorical Industrial users
      1.   Where the Village has imposed mass limitations on a CIU as provided
for by 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required by Section
4-19-7-3 A.1. shall indicate the mass of Pollutants regulated by the
Pretreatment Standards in the Discharge from the CIU.
      2.   For a CIU subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the Village in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6
(c), the report required by paragraph A.1. of this section shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other CIUs
subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed only in terms of
allowable Pollutant Discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), the report required by Section
4-19-7-3 A.1. shall include the user's actual average production rate for the
reporting period.
      3.   In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a
Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the CIU
must submit documentation required by the Coordinator or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      4.   Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for pollutants found to be not
present and revision of the user's permit by the Coordinator, the CIU must
certify on each periodic report with the statement in Section
4-19-5-6, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the user with the following statement:
      Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR
                   (specify applicable National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard part(s)), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
there has been no increase in the level of the                          (list
the categorically regulated pollutant(s)) in the wastewaters due to the
activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report.
      5.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of Section
4-19-7-3 A.1. or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Coordinator, and notify the Coordinator.
   C.   Non-Significant Categorical users
      1.   NSCIUs as defined in Section
4-19-1-6 shall annually (on dates specified in a wastewater discharge permit),
submit the following certification statement signed by an authorized
representative of the user. The certification must also accompany any
alternative report required by the village.
      Based on the inquiry of the Person or Persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
      , I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that during the
period from                  ,                         to                     ,
                : [months, days, year]
         a.   The facility described as                                  
[facility name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial
user as described in 19.106 of the Village of Minooka Code of Ordinances;
         b.   The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements during this reporting period; and
         c.   The facility never discharged more than one hundred (100) gallons
of total categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
      This compliance certification is based on the following information:
                                                                                                            
   D.   Other Non-Significant Regulated users: Categorical Zero Process
Dischargers, Non-Categorical Zero Process Dischargers, Batch Dischargers, FSEs,
and any firms regulated by individual or general Wastewater Discharge Permit
requirements including but not limited to Best Management Practices shall
submit a periodic report at a frequency defined in the applicable Wastewater
Discharge Permit or at a frequency determined by the Coordinator.
   E.   All other users shall submit periodic reports as required by the
Coordinator: The reports may require sampling and analyses or some other
measure to determine compliance with an issued permit, pretreatment standards
and requirements, or the requirements of this chapter. The user must submit
documentation necessary to determine the compliance status of the user as
defined by the Coordinator or as identified in the wastewater discharge permit.
As the Coordinator deems necessary, a user may be required to analyze for one
or more pollutants not listed in the local limits or pretreatment standards.
(Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-7-4: AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE CHANGE NOTIFICATION:
Any significant industrial user that changes the authorized representative of
its company shall file a change notice with the Village within thirty (30)
calendar days of the effective date of the change. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)

unreported pollutants including changes to the listed or characteristic
hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under
Section
4-19-7-8, introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring waiver had been
obtained, the addition of a new process regardless of waste discharge or lack
of discharge, shutdown of a process, or addition or deletion of a product.
   D.   SIUs and CIUs are required to notify the Coordinator of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-
24-2020)
4-19-7-6: REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
   A.   Initial Accidental Discharge Notification. In the case of any
discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of
a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load
that may cause potential problems for the POTW, any user shall immediately
telephone (within fifteen (15) minutes of gaining knowledge of the discharge),
and notify the Coordinator of the incident. If this notification cannot be made
to the POTW staff during routine business hours, the user shall notify the
Minooka Police Department at (815) 741-3177. This notification shall include
the name of the caller, location of the discharge, physical state of discharge,
chemical composition, concentration and volume, if known, date and time of
discharge as well as duration of the discharge, and corrective actions taken by
the user. The notification shall include what Federal, state and local entities
have also been, or will be, notified by the user.
   B.   The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   C.   Written Accidental Discharge Notification: Within five (5) business
days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the
Coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences.
   D.   Such notifications shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-7-7: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
   A.   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must
notify the Coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. It is acceptable for a consultant acting on behalf of the user to
provide notification to the village. Failure to notify the Coordinator shall be
considered significant noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter and
shall be subject to the enforcement responses and penalties listed herein.
   B.   The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Coordinator within thirty (30) calendar
days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to
resample if the village monitors at the user's facility at least once a month,
or if the village samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user
receives the results of this sampling. If the village performed the sampling
and analysis in lieu of the user, the village will perform the repeat sampling
and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user
to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-7-8: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12 (P) any user who commences the Discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the USEPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
Discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the USEPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous discharge, batch
discharge, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100)
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180)
calendar days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section
4-19-7-5 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this subsection does
not apply to pollutants already reported by CIUs under the self-monitoring
requirements of Section
4-19-7-2 A., Section
4-19-7-2 B., and Section
4-19-7-3 B. of this chapter.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Section
4-19-7-8 A., above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Coordinator, the USEPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substances within
ninety (90) calendar days of the effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this subsection, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   E.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit issued hereunder, or any applicable Federal or state law. (Ord. 2020-33,
11-24-2020)
4-19-7-9: REPORT SUBMITTAL DUE DATES:
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.
For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern. In order to meet deadlines, reports may be faxed or emailed on
the due date to the village. If submitted electronically on the due date, the
original of the fax or email is required to be mailed to the village postmarked
within one (1) work day of the transmission. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-8: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
4-19-8-1: RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The Pretreatment Coordinator and his designee(s), Duly Authorized Agents of the
Village, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA), and the United
States Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as "the above-
named entities", shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any individual or general wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the above-named entities ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, analyses, records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, the above-named entities will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The village shall be permitted to take photographs or videos as needed
to compile sufficient information from inspections. Such photographs and video
files shall be kept confidential upon request of the user.
   C.   The above-named entities shall have the right to set up on the user's
property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations, inspect the premises for
leaks or stoppages, or to place dye in the sanitary pipe as to ascertain
whether or not said sanitary pipe is draining into the proper POTW.
   D.   The village may install monitoring equipment as necessary. The village
retains the ability to maintain the sampling and monitoring equipment installed
by the village at all times, and the user shall provide a safe and proper
operating condition at its own cost and expense. All devices used to measure
Wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at the manufacturer's
recommended frequency to ensure their accuracy.
   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Coordinator and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   F.   If necessary, the user shall provide a knowledgeable guide to assist
with the inspectors' purpose on site by providing all necessary information.
   G.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the above-named entities access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   H.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist, pursuant
to Section
4-19-2-2, the "sampling facility" shall be considered to be the more feasible
location of the following locations based on the sampling conditions and
assurance of compliance: the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to
the point at which the building sewer is connected or the most effective point
of access to wastewater discharge prior to connection to the public sewer, even
if the wastewater discharge at that point does not contain all wastewater from
the user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-8-2: RECORD KEEPING:
Both the village and users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(o). (Ord. 2020-33, 11-
24-2020)
4-19-8-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If any of the above-named entities have been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof of the user, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the above-
named entity may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of
Will, Grundy, or Kendall Counties. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-9: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
4-19-9-1: SUBMITTING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual or general wastewater discharge
permits, and monitoring programs, and the Pretreatment Coordinator inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Coordinator and Village Attorney, that such information is
exempt from the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, as amended, as
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of
the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing
a report that such information is exempt from the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act, as amended, the portions of a report which are exempt from the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act shall not be made available for inspection
by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or Pretreatment
Program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the Person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data"
as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-
2020)
4-19-10: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The Pretreatment Coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12)
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be
applicable to all SIUs and CIUs (or any other user that violates paragraphs C.,
D. or H. of this section and shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of Wastewater Discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the
measurements taken for the same pollutant during a six-month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement as defined in
Section
4-19-1 of this chapter, including instantaneous limits;
   B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits,
as defined by Section
4-19-1 of this chapter multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS,
FOG, and 1.2 for all other Pollutants except pH);
   C.   The six-month timeframe used to determine chronic and TRC SNC status is
assessed on a rolling-quarter basis. A user is evaluated at the end of a
calendar quarter and the six-month period is comprised of the current quarter
and the previous quarter. All sampling results must be used when determining
SNC status, including both compliance samples taken by the village and self-
monitoring samples taken by the user in compliance with USEPA Methods.
   D.   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement
as defined by Section
4-19-1 of this chapter (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit,
or narrative standard) that the Coordinator determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   E.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Coordinator's exercise
of his or her emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   F.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, a compliance schedule, administrative order, or enforcement
compliance schedule for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   G.   Failure to provide within forty-five (45) calendar days after the due
date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   H.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   I.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, that the Coordinator determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 2020-33,
11-24-2020)
4-19-11: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
4-19-11-1: NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
   A.   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may serve upon that user a written
NOV. The user shall respond to the NOV by the deadline defined therein, which
shall be a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days from the postmarked date.
      1.   The user's response shall include an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction of the cause of the violation and
prevention of future violations with specific required actions. The response in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the NOV.
   B.   An NOV may include a fee to recover the cost of generating the NOV. The
user receiving the NOV shall remit payment of the cost recovery fee to the
Village by the deadline defined therein, which shall be a minimum of thirty
(30) calendar days from the postmarked date.
   C.   An NOV may include one or more penalties, as outlined in Section 12 of
this chapter.
   D.   Issuance of an NOV shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-11-2: COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS:
The Coordinator may enter into Compliance Agreements, (i.e. "consent orders",
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for Noncompliance). Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the Noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
4-19-11-4 and
4-19-11-5 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 2020-33,
11-24-2020)
4-19-11-3: SHOW CAUSE ORDER:
The Coordinator may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear for a
hearing before representatives of the village and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken against the user. Notice of such hearing
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the
proposed enforcement action to be taken, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken against the user. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally
or by certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) work days
prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-
24-2020)
4-19-11-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Coordinator
may issue an order to the user directing that the user comply with this
chapter, the wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement within a specified time. If the user
does not comply within the time provided, sanitary sewer service may be
discontinued by the village. Compliance orders may contain other requirements
to address the noncompliance, including the installation of adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or related appurtenances, additional self-monitoring, and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged
to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A user may petition the Coordinator to reconsider a decision to discontinue
sanitary sewer service by submitting a petition within thirty (30) calendar
days of the discontinuation of sanitary sewer service to the Coordinator
indicating the user's objections to the discontinuation. If the Coordinator
fails to act within thirty (30) calendar days, the request for reconsideration
shall be deemed denied. Denial of a request for reconsideration shall be
considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
Parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative decision must do so
by filing a complaint with the Circuit Court of Will County within sixty (60)
calendar days. An appeal of discontinuation does not bar against or prevent the
village and coordinator from taking other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-
33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-11-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the Coordinator may issue an order
to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge of wastewater.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-
24-2020)
4-19-11-6: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The Coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge of wastewater
whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
of wastewater which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Coordinator
may also immediately suspend a user's discharge of wastewater that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Coordinator may
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance,
disconnection, or blocking of the building sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Coordinator that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
section
4-19-11-7 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge of
wastewater presenting imminent endangerment as identified by the Coordinator
shall submit a detailed written statement signed by the authorized
representative of the user, describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Coordinator
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections
4-19-11-3 or
4-19-11-7 of this chapter.
   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-11-7: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in Section
4-19-11-6 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to termination of its wastewater discharge:
   A.   Violation of one (1) or more wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of one (1) or more of the pretreatment standards in Section
4-19-3 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge of
wastewater and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
4-19-11-3 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-12: PENALTIES AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
4-19-12-1: ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS:

escalating enforcement actions and penalties in addition to an administrative
cost recovery fee. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-12-2: RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED:
   A.   Any person or user violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or
who causes damage to or impairs the POTW, shall be liable to the Village for
all expenses, costs, losses, and damages caused directly or indirectly by such
violation. The village may invoice costs and expenses including, but not
limited to, sampling and analyses associated with the investigation, mitigating
impact to the POTW, preparing the administrative enforcement actions such as
notices and orders, investigative and/or correction actions, and review of
response(s) from the user. The village shall invoice the user for the costs and
expenses incurred by the village for any and all cleaning, repair, replacement,
or other investigative and/or corrective action(s) as a response to the
violation. Any user that does not pay to the village all such assessed costs
and expenses shall constitute a violation of this chapter enforceable under the
provisions of Section
4-19-11 of this chapter.
   B.   Liens. If any user refuses to remedy a violation of the provisions of
this chapter and said violations are remedied by the village, a notice of lien
for the cost and expenses incurred shall be recorded in accordance with state
and local law. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-12-3: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Coordinator may fine such user in an
amount not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) and/or be
incarcerated in a penal institution other than a penitentiary for not to exceed
six (6) months (65 ILCS 5/1-2-1). Such fines shall be assessed on a per-
violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after fifteen (15) calendar
days of the date due, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of
the unpaid balance. If the unpaid balance is not paid within forty-five (45)
days after the rendition of the invoice, enforcement actions shall be
escalated, as appropriate. A lien against the user's property shall be sought
for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring reconsideration of such fines must file a written
request for the Coordinator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within thirty (30) calendar days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, the Coordinator may convene a hearing on the matter.
In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-
24-2020)
4-19-12-4: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Village
Attorney may petition the Circuit Court of Will County for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Coordinator
may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-
2020)
4-19-12-5: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual or general wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the village for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
   B.   The Coordinator may recover costs, including but not limited to, filing
fees, witness fees, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated
with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and
the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Village.
   C.   In determining the amount of fines and/or civil liability, the court or
judicial administrator shall take into account all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through
the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of
the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   D.   Issuing a notice of local chapter violation or the filing a suit for
civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-12-6: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
   A.   In addition to remedies available to the village set forth elsewhere in
this chapter, if the village is fined by the State or USEPA for violation of
its NPDES permit or violation of water quality standards as the result of
discharge of pollutants by a user or group of users, then the fine, including
all legal, sampling, analytical testing costs, and any other related costs
incurred by the village shall be charges to the responsible user or group of
users. Such charges shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies the village may have under this chapter, statutes, regulations, at law
or in equity.
   B.   If the discharge from any user causes a deposit, obstruction, or damage
to any portion of the POTW, the Coordinator shall cause the deposit or
obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to be promptly repaired.
The cost for such work, including materials, labor, and supervision, shall be
borne by the person or user causing such deposit, obstruction, or damage. (Ord.
2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-12-7: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Coordinator
may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the village's enforcement response plan. However, the Coordinator may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
Coordinator is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
Noncompliant user. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-13: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
4-19-13-1: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The Pretreatment Coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, a previous individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to
the village, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Coordinator to be
necessary to achieve consistent compliance. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-13-2: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The Coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, a previous individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused
by the user's discharge of wastewater. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)

to the village held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of
the Coordinator. (Ord. 2020- 33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-14: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
4-19-14-1: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "Upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary Noncompliance with Categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of paragraph C., below, are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the Pretreatment
Coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written report must be provided within
five (5) work days):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action is brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-
2020)
4-19-14-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section
4-19-3 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to
know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference or that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the village was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements. (Ord.
2020-33, 11-24-2020)
4-19-14-3: BYPASS:
   A.   For the purposes of this section,
      1.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      2.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of Subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Bypass Notifications
      1.   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Coordinator, at least ten (10) work days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      2.   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the coordinator of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) work days of the time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Coordinator may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty-four (24) hours.
   D.   Village Actions
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Coordinator may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under part C. of this
section.
      2.   The Coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Coordinator determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in paragraph D.1. of this section. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)

nonresidential users is determined by the village to include wastes in addition
to average strength domestic waste, the user shall pay a surcharge cost in
addition to the basic user charge and the basic user rate.
   The surcharge rate for excess strengths are as follows:
      Biochemical Oxygen Demand   =   $0.66/lb BOD (if COD/BOD>2.25)
      Biochemical Oxygen Demand   =   $1.98/lb BOD (if COD/BOD<2.25)
      Suspended solids   =   $0.64/lb suspended solids
      *All rates to increase annually beginning on 5/1 by 3% unless otherwise
identified by the Village Board
   Computation Of Wastewater Service Charge: The daily BOD5 loading subject to
surcharge shall be established by the following calculation (negative values
shall not be included in the calculation):
      BOD5 loading subject to surcharge = ( (Gallons Discharged x (BOD5
Concentration mg/L - 200 mg/L) x 8.345 x 10-6) pounds) X Rate = Surcharge
   The daily TSS loading subject to surcharge shall be established by the
following calculation (negative values shall not be included in the
calculation):
      TSS loading subject to surcharge = ((Gallons Discharged x (TSS
Concentration mg/L - 250 mg/L) x 8.345 x 10-6) pounds) X Rate = Surcharge (Ord.
2020-33, 11-24-2020)

Major industrial waste dischargers, within ninety (90) days of the date of
notification by the village, shall install and maintain at their expense
acceptable water meters or flow metering devices, samplers and manholes as
required to determine waste characteristics discharged to the public sewers.
Flow metering devices, installed in monitoring manholes on service lines, will
be required for measurement of the volume of waste discharged to the sewers
when volumes cannot otherwise be determined from metered water consumption
records. This determination shall be made by the village.
The industry shall install and maintain waste samplers and hire an approved
laboratory to complete waste testing when directed by the village. Waste
sampling and testing shall be completed by the discharger as often as may be
deemed necessary by the village, and all certified test results shall be
forwarded to the village. The village shall reserve the right to sample and
test all dischargers at any time and bill the dischargers for all involved
costs. The village shall establish discharge loads. (Ord. 2020-33, 11-24-2020)

5-3-16:   ANTI-MONOTONY STANDARDS:
   A.   The purpose of these requirements is to preserve the aesthetically
pleasing character of development by promoting such character, protecting and
enhancing property values, and to promote the easy identification of houses, by
encouraging dwelling units of distinctive design and discouraging excessive
similarity among adjacent dwellings.
   B.   All residential construction in the village is subject to the following
standards:
      1.   No two (2) single-family dwellings or single-family attached
buildings of substantially similar front elevation or facade shall be
constructed or located adjacent to one another, nor shall there be constructed
or located more than twenty-five percent (25%) of buildings of substantially
similar front elevation or facade on any block.
         a.   For the purposes of these anti-monotony provisions, a "block"
shall be measured as the greater of (i) the space between two intervening cross
streets or (ii) six hundred sixty feet (660') from lot line to lot line.
         b.   For the purposes of these anti-monotony provisions, a "front"
elevation or facade shall include every elevation or facade facing a street or
public way, such as the front and rear faces of a building on a through lot or
the front and side faces of a building on a corner lot.
      2.   A building on a corner lot shall not be considered substantially
similar to another building in the same block if the front elevations of the
buildings face different streets. On cul-de-sac turnarounds, no building shall
have a front elevation or facade which is substantially similar to any other
building on the cul-de-sac.
      3.   A building shall not be considered substantially similar to another
building if a preponderance of the front elevations of the two buildings are of
different color and the front elevations of the two buildings differ as to two
or more of the characteristics set forth below (a-i).
         a.   Roof type (e.g. gable, hip, mansard, gambrel, flat, combination,
etc.).
         b.   Roof height.
         c.   Approximate dimensions (height and length) of the front
elevation.
         d.   Shape of the front elevation silhouette.
         e.   Relative locations and sizes of windows in the front elevation,
including the addition of bay window(s).
         f.   Siding type (e.g. brick veneer, lapped horizontal siding, half-
timber, board and batten, shakes, etc.) on the front elevation.
         g.   Relative locations and dimensions of garage door(s), if included
on the front elevation.
         h.   Reverse elevations.
         i.   Housing styles (e.g. ranch, bi-level, tri-level, 1½ , 2, and 3
story).
   However, a change in roof color shall not constitute a factor of
dissimilarity.
      4.   If the building and zoning administrator, or person acting in that
capacity, finds that the dwelling for which a building permit is requested is
substantially similar to a dwelling for which a building permit has been issued
for a dwelling located adjacent to it, or located in any block with more than
twenty-five percent (25%) of buildings of substantially similar front elevation
or facade, if issued, the building and zoning administrator shall deny the
permit request for noncompliance with this chapter.
      5.   An applicant for a building permit that has been denied based on the
provisions of this chapter may:
         a.   Alter the dwelling plans so that the proposed dwelling is no
longer substantially similar to the other dwelling(s), according to the
criteria specified in this chapter.
         b.   Appeal the decision of the building and zoning administrator, or
person acting in that capacity, to the village board of trustees.
      6.   In appealing the interpretation of this chapter to the village board
of trustees, an applicant for a building permit shall present evidence
sufficient to demonstrate conformity with this article, such as, but not
limited to architectural drawings. (Ord. 2024-57, 12-17-2024)

a period of six (6) consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be renewed, and
any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of the
district in which the land is located.

triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape, area and dimensions of
the lot to be built upon, the exact size and location on the lot of the
existing buildings and accessory buildings, and the lines within which the new
buildings or structures shall be erected, the existing and intended use of each
building or structure, the number of dwelling units or lodging rooms a building
is designed to accommodate, location and number of off-street parking and off-
street loading spaces, and such other information with regard to the lot and
neighboring lots and performance standards as may be necessary to determine and
provide for the enforcement of this Title. One copy of such plans shall be
returned to the owner when such plans shall have been approved by the Building
Officer and Inspector. The lot and location of the building thereon shall be
staked out on the ground before construction is started. (Ord., 5-15-1974)
5-11-5: CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
   A.   Occupancy Permit Required.
      1.   No land shall be occupied or used in a manner different than that
existing on the effective date hereof, and no building or structure hereafter
erected or altered shall be occupied or used in whole or in part for any
purpose whatsoever until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by
the Building Officer and Inspector stating that the building, structure or land
improvement complies with all the building and health laws and the provisions
of this Title.
      2.   No change of use shall be made in any building, structure or land
improvement or part thereof, now or hereafter erected or altered, without an
occupancy permit having been issued by the Building Officer and Inspector, and
no permit shall be issued to make such change unless it is in conformity with
the provisions of this Title and amendments thereto.
      3.   No zoning certificate or occupancy permit for a change of use in an
existing building, structure or land improvement shall be issued until the
premises have been inspected and certified by the Building Officer and
Inspector to be in compliance with applicable requirements for the zoning
district in which it is located.
      4.   The Building Officer and Inspector shall not issue any permanent
occupancy permit for any new construction, whether residential, commercial,
industrial, or otherwise, prior to the completion of the construction and
installation of all required facilities therein, but the Building Officer and
Inspector may issue temporary occupancy permits in as permitted by this
Section, below.
      5.   Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the continuance of the present
occupancy or use of any existing building, structure, or lane improvement,
except as may be necessary for the safety of life and property.
      6.   Application for a certificate of occupancy shall be made coincident
with the application for a zoning certificate and shall be issued within ten
(10) days after the erection or alteration of the building or structure has
been completed. A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file
in the office of the Building Officer and Inspector and copies shall be
furnished on request to any person having proprietary or tenancy interest in
the land, building or structure affected. A fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall
be charged for each original certificate, and one dollar ($1.00) for each copy
thereof.
   B.   Temporary Occupancy Permits. Pending the issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy, a temporary permit may be issued to be valid for a
period not to exceed six (6) months from its date, during the completion of any
building, structure or land improvement or during partial occupancy thereof.
Application for a temporary permit shall be accompanied with a statement
covering the items of work to be completed and the reasons the temporary permit
is requested.
      1.   Upon receipt of an application for a temporary occupancy permit, the
Building Officer and Inspector, shall review the application and the status of
construction to determine whether permitting temporary occupancy, in light of
the outstanding work required to complete construction, would pose a threat to
or otherwise affect the health, safety and welfare of the occupants of such
buildings or of other persons who may be on the premises and site of such
buildings. If the Building Officer and Inspector determines that allowing
temporary occupancy would not pose a threat to or otherwise affect the health,
safety and welfare of the occupants of such buildings or of other persons who
may be on the premises and site of such buildings, he may issue a temporary
occupancy permit. Otherwise, he shall deny the application in a writing setting
out the reason for the denial. Examples of incomplete items that the Building
Officer and Inspector may (but is not required to) consider safe in issuing an
occupancy permit when construction is not complete include, but are not limited
to, the following: gutters, down spouts, patios, decks, cabinets, fixtures,
yard grading, driveways, unfinished bathrooms, unfinished second floors in two
(2) story homes, damaged sidewalks, window well drains, exterior caulking and
interior trim.
      2.   No temporary occupancy permit shall be issued unless and until the
applicant therefore has provided the Building Officer and Inspector with a
complete list of outstanding items necessary for the completion of
construction, as well as financial surety to ensure completion of all such
items. The financial surety may be in any form acceptable to the Building
Officer and Inspector, including without limitation a cash deposit, bond, or
letter of credit, and may be required to be in the name or account of the owner
of the building, the construction contractor thereof, or both as determined by
the Building Officer and Inspector. The amount of the financial surety shall be
sufficient to complete the construction of said building, the installation of
all required facilities therein, and/or the completion of any and all land
improvements required by code, plus twenty five percent (25%). In the case of a
cash deposit, said deposit shall be held in a separate account by the Village
and shall be returned to the person depositing the same upon the Building
Officer and Inspector's written statement that the unfinished construction for
which such deposit was required has been completed in accordance with the
provisions so stipulated by ordinance. All construction work for which said
deposit is being held must be completed no later than six (6) months from date
of the temporary occupancy permit. Any portion remaining unfinished after the
six (6) month period shall be just cause for the forfeiture of the total amount
deposited.
      3.   In the event that any temporary occupancy permit issued pursuant to
this Section expires before all outstanding construction items have been
completed and a permanent occupancy permit has been granted, all occupancy of
the structure in question must immediately cease. Continued occupancy of the
structure following expiration of the temporary occupancy permit and prior to
the issuance of a permanent occupancy permit is a violation of this Code, and
the penalty for the same is seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00). Each day
that the violation continues is and shall be deemed a separate offense.
      4.   No temporary occupancy permit may be extended beyond six (6) months
except upon good cause shown, and then only if approved by resolution of the
Corporate Authorities of the Village.

5-11-6: VARIATIONS:
   A.   Authority: The Board of Trustees shall decide all applications for
variations of the provisions of this Title after a public hearing held before
the Planning and Zoning Commission 1. See Title 2, Chapter 1 of this Code.1 .
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold public hearings upon all
applications for variations and shall report its recommendations to the Board
of Trustees. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend a variation
only after they have made a finding of fact specifying the reason or reasons
for recommending the variation. Such findings shall be based upon the standards
prescribed in subsection D of this Section. No variation shall be granted to
the Board of Trustees without such findings of fact. When the Planning and
Zoning Commission fails to recommend a variation, it can only be adopted by an
ordinance with the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of Trustees.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review all applications for variations
for conformity of the applications with the Comprehensive Plan, the provisions
of this Title, and to generally accepted standards of land use policy. (Ord.,
5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1988-19, 12-12-1988; Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
   B.   Initiation: An application for a variation may be made by any
governmental office, department, board, bureau or commission or by any person
having a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, an
option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest applicable to the land
or land and improvements described in the application for a variation. (Ord.,
5-15-1974)
   C.   Application For Variation And Notice Of Hearing: An application for a
variation shall be filed with the Village Clerk, who shall forward a copy of
the same to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Village Board of
Trustees without delay. The application shall contain such information as the
Planning and Zoning Commission may from time to time by rule provide. No
application shall be considered complete until all exhibits called for in the
application have been filed, and the filing fee paid. No more than ninety (90)
days after the filing of such application, a hearing shall be held on the
application, except that if the application is not complete at least twenty
(20) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the hearing shall be continued over
to another scheduled meeting. Notice of such hearing shall be published at
least once, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days
before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation within the village.
The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as
the planning and zoning commission may by rule provide. The filing fee for the
application shall be in the amount of one hundred twenty five dollars
($125.00), and shall be paid at the time an application for variation is filed.
The filing fee, once paid, is nonrefundable. (Ord. 1994-4, 1-11-1994)
   D.   Standards For Variations: The planning and zoning commission shall not
recommend a variation of the regulations of this title, as authorized herein
unless it shall have made findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
      1.   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the district in which it is located;
      2.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
      3.   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality; and
      4.   For the purpose of implementing the above rules, the planning and
zoning commission shall also, in making its determination whether there are
practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the
extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been
established by the evidence: (Ord., 5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
         a.   The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
         b.   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable, generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
         c.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by the
owner of the property, or by a previous owner;
         e.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; and
         f.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood. (Ord., 5-15-1974)
   The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the board of trustees
may require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a
variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this
section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other
property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the general intent of
this zoning title. (Ord., 5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
   The planning and zoning commission shall file its written recommendations on
each application for variation with the village clerk. The village clerk shall
forward a copy of the written recommendations to the board of trustees, and the
applicant. (Ord. 1988-19, 12-12-1988; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
   E.   Authorized Variations: Variations from the regulations of this zoning
title shall be granted by the planning and zoning commission only in accordance
with the standards set out in this section and may be granted only in the
following instances, and in no others: (Ord., 5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-
24-1993)
      1.   To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback required
by the applicable regulations;
      2.   To permit the use of a lot or lots of record on the effective date
hereof for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or
width of the lot or lots;
      3.   To permit the same off street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses, provided that substantial use of
such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week; and
      4.   To reduce the applicable off street parking or loading facilities
required by ten percent (10%) of the applicable regulations. (Ord., 5-15-1974)
      5.   To permit the construction of:
         a.   Signs with a total aggregate sign area per lot in excess of that
permitted by Section
5-13-6, provided that the total such sign face area permitted shall not exceed
an aggregate total of 1,320 square feet per lot; and
         b.   commercial ground or pole signs with a height in excess of that
permitted by Section
5-13-6, provided that under no circumstances shall any ground sign be permitted
to exceed a total height of twenty feet (20') above the normal finished grade
beneath it to the top of the sign or any pole sign be permitted to exceed a
total height of eighty feet (80') above the normal finished grade beneath it to
the top of the sign; and
         c.   commercial ground and pole signs with aggregate sign areas (per
sign) in excess of those permitted by Section
5-13-16, provided that under no circumstances shall any ground sign be
permitted to have an aggregate sign face (per sign) in excess of (200) square
feet or any pole sign to have an aggregate sign face (per sign) in excess of
six hundred thirty-six square feet (636 ft2).
   But only if such signs are located in B or M zoning districts and located
within one thousand seven hundred fifty feet (1,750') of the right of way of
Interstate 80.
      6.   To permit patios, terraces and decks in front or side yards for
property located in the residential zoning districts, provided the patios,
terraces and decks do not interfere with existing public utility and drainage
easements.
      7.   To permit the construction and maintenance of fences in residential,
business and industrial districts that are taller than permitted by the rules
and regulations of Chapter 12 of this Title, provided that no such fence may be
permitted to be in excess of eight feet (8').
      8.   To permit variances to the maximum height of nonresidential
structures, not to exceed fifty feet (50'). (Ord. 2007-42, 9-11-2007; amd. Ord.

grounds thereof and he shall forthwith transmit to the Planning and Zoning
Commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
   B.   An appeal stays all the proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to
the Planning and Zoning Commission, after the notice of appeal has been filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in
his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property in which case proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by a court of record on application,
on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   C.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall fix a reasonable time, not to
exceed ninety (90) days, for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice
thereof to the parties and decide the same within a reasonable time. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion
ought to be made on the premises and to that end shall have all the powers of
the officer from whom the appeal was taken. (Ord., 5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1993-
12, 8-24-1993)
5-11-8: AMENDMENTS:

Planning and Zoning Commission and a report of its findings and recommendations
has thereafter been submitted to the Board of Trustees.
   B.   Initiation Of Amendments: Amendments may be proposed by the Board of
Trustees, Planning and Zoning Commission and by any person having a freehold
interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual

exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land
which is described in the application for an amendment. (Ord., 5-15-1974; amd.
Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
   C.   Application For An Amendment And Notice Of Hearing: An application for
an amendment shall be filed with the Village Clerk, who shall forward a copy of
the same to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Village Board of
Trustees without delay. The application shall contain such information as the
Planning and Zoning Commission may from time to time by rule provide. No
application shall be considered complete until all exhibits called for in the
application have been filed, and the filing fee paid. No more than ninety (90)
days after the filing of such application, a hearing shall be held on the
application, except that if the application is not complete at least twenty
(20) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the hearing shall be continued over

The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as
the planning and zoning commission may by rule provide. The filing fee for the
application shall be in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), and shall
be paid at the time an application for amendment is filed. The filing fee, once

   D.   Decisions:
      1.   The board of trustees, upon report of the planning and zoning
commission and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed
amendment in accordance with applicable Illinois statutes, or may refer it back
to the planning and zoning commission for further consideration. (Ord., 5-15-
1974; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
      2.   In case a written protest against any proposed amendment is signed
and acknowledged by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to
be altered, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage
immediately adjoining or across the alley therefrom, or by owners of twenty
percent (20%) of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be altered, is
filed with the village clerk, the amendment cannot be passed except on the
favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members of the board of trustees.
(Ord., 5-15-1974)
5-11-9: CONDITIONAL PERMITTED USES:
   A.   Purpose: The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive ordinance is
based on the division of the entire village into districts in each of which are
permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such
permitted, compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses
which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which,
on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public
facilities, need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or
operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this
title as "conditional permitted uses" and fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated
utilities, or uses traditionally affected by public interest;
      2.   Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their
peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public,
and their possible damaging influence on the neighborhood, may have to be
established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be
allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the zoning regulations. (Ord.,
5-15-1974)
   B.   Initiation: Conditional permitted uses may be proposed by the Board of
Trustees, Planning and Zoning Commission and by any person having a freehold
interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual
interest which may become a freehold interest, an option to purchase or any
exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land
which is described in the application for a conditional permitted use. (Ord.,
5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
   C.   Application For Conditional Permitted Use And Notice Of Hearing: An
application for a conditional permitted use shall be filed with the Village
Clerk, who shall forward a copy of the same to the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the Village Board of Trustees without delay. The application
shall contain such information as the Planning and Zoning Commission may from
time to time by rule provide. No application shall be considered complete until
all exhibits called for in the application have been filed, and the filing fee
paid. No more than ninety (90) days after the filing of such application, a
hearing shall be held on the application, except that if the application is not
complete at least twenty (20) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the hearing
shall be continued over to another scheduled meeting. Notice of such hearing
shall be published at least once, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than
fifteen (15) days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation
within the Village. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional
form of notice as the Planning and Zoning Commission may by rule provide. The
filing fee for the application shall be in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00), and shall be paid at the time an application for conditional
permitted use is filed. The filing fee, once paid, is nonrefundable. (Ord.
1994-4, 1-11-1994)
   D.   Decisions:
      1.   The Board of Trustees, upon report of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed
conditional permitted use in accordance with applicable Illinois statutes, or
may refer it back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further
consideration. (Ord., 5-15-1974; amd. Ord. 1993-12, 8-24-1993)
      2.   In case a written protest against any proposed conditional permitted
use signed and acknowledged by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage
proposed to be altered, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the
frontage immediately adjoining or across the alley therefrom, or by owners of
twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be
altered, is filed with the Village Clerk, the conditional permitted use cannot
be passed except on the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members of
the Board of Trustees. (Ord., 5-15-1974)
   E.   Effective Period: No conditional use permit shall be valid for a period
longer than one year from the date it is granted, unless a building permit or
certificate of occupancy is obtained within such period and the erection or
alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within such period.
The Board may grant one extension of this period, valid for no more than one
hundred eighty (180) additional days, upon written application to the Board for
the request for extension to be placed on a Village Board agenda for action and
good cause shown by the applicant. No notice or hearing is required for the
granting of such an extension. If any conditional use is abandoned or
discontinued for a continuous period of one year, the conditional use permit
for such use shall become void, and such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished unless a new conditional use permit is obtained. (Ord. 1997-08,
5-27-1997)
5-11-10: PENALTY, ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, refuses to comply
with, or who resists enforcement of any of the provisions of this Zoning Title
shall, upon conviction, be fined as provided in Section
1-4-1 of this Code for each offense. Each day that a violation is permitted to
exist shall constitute a separate offense.
   B.   The Building Officer and Inspector is hereby designated and authorized
to enforce this Title. However, it shall also be the duty of all officers,
citizens and employees of the Village to assist the Building Officer and
Inspector by reporting to him any new construction, reconstruction, improved
land uses, or upon any seeming violation. (Ord., 5-15-1974)

directed or he shall be in violation of this code, and the village attorney
shall cause a complaint to be issued and processed against said owner or
occupier in accordance with rules of the circuit court of Grundy County or Will

5-13-18: OFF-PREMISES SIGNS PROHIBITED; CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FOR COMBINATION
SIGNS:
   A.   In general, no sign authorized in any district under this chapter is or
shall be deemed a permitted principal use of a lot. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section, all signs permitted by this chapter must be installed
or constructed as an accessory to the existing use of the lot upon which the
sign is located.
   B.   As an exception to the foregoing, combination signs may be permitted in
the commercial districts as a conditional permitted use under section
5-11-9 of this title.
   C.   The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend, and the village
board shall not approve, a conditional use permit for a combination sign unless
it finds full compliance with all of the following in addition to any other
findings required by section
5-11-9 of this title:
      1.   Both the lot upon which the combination sign is proposed and all
other lot(s) served thereby (that is, lots that are authorized to place signage
on said sign) must be included in the zoning application for the conditional
use permit, and the owners of all such lot(s) must consent to approval.
      2.   Approval to place signage on a combination sign is in lieu of the
same type of sign on the served lots. That is, if a lot is authorized to
include signage on an off-premises ground or pole sign, the lot may not also
have a separate on-premises ground or pole sign (as appropriate).
      3.   The sign area of the sign cabinet assigned to and approved for any
particular served lot shall count against the aggregate signage allowed on that
served lot pursuant to section
5-13-6 of this chapter.
      4.   The nearest lot line of each served lot must be located within seven
hundred seventy-five feet (775') of the combination sign structure, measured
from the outside edge of its base.
      5.   The owner and/or occupant of every lot authorized to include signage
on a combination sign must be granted adequate rights to access and maintain
the combination sign. All such owners/occupants are and shall be jointly and
severally liable for the maintenance and code compliance of the entire
combination sign.
      6.   In the event that the owner or occupant of any lot having signage on
an approved combination sign ceases to operate its business, it shall remove
its signage from the sign within one hundred and eighty (180) days. In the
event that the owner/occupant in question fails to do so, all other users of
the combination sign shall be jointly and severally responsible and liable to
the removal and costs of removal. (Ord. 2025-6, 5-27-2025)
5-13-19: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
   A.   All permanent signs which are legally in existence at the time of
passage of this chapter, but which do not conform to one or more provisions of
this chapter, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be
continued only as provided in this title.
   B.   Any nonconforming sign rendered nonconforming by the provisions of this
chapter may be continued in use, provided there is no physical change other
than necessary maintenance and repair, except as otherwise permitted herein.
   C.   Whenever a nonconforming sign has been discontinued for a period of six
(6) consecutive months, or whenever there is evidently a clear intent on the
part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming sign, such sign shall not, after
being discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished, and the sign thereafter
shall be brought into conformity with the regulations of this chapter. Any such
discontinued sign shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent, or
person having the beneficial use of the structure upon which such sign may be
found within ten (10) days after written notification from the building
commissioner, and upon failure to comply with such notice within the time
specified in such order, the building commissioner may cause removal of such
sign, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the
property to which such sign is attached.
   D.   Normal maintenance of a nonconforming sign is permitted, including
necessary nonstructural repairs or incidental alterations which do not extend
or intensify the nonconforming features of the sign.
   E.   No structural alteration, enlargement or extension shall be made in a
nonconforming sign, unless the alteration will result in eliminating the
nonconforming use.
   F.   If a nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the
extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value at that time, or
fifty percent (50%) or more of the physical structure, whichever is least, the
sign can be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming use and in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. In the event the damage or
destruction is less than fifty percent (50%), the sign may then be restored to
its original condition and the use may be continued which existed at the time
of such partial destruction until the nonconforming sign is otherwise abated by
the provisions of this chapter. In either event, restoration or repair must be
started within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of damage or
destruction, and diligently prosecuted to completion.
   G.   Existing temporary mobile signs shall be removed or permitted hereunder
no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of this chapter. (Ord.
1998-1, 1-13-1998)
5-13-20: DUTIES:

subdivision or lot divisions. Subdivisions or lot divisions containing no lots
less than one acre in area and located in the unincorporated areas within one
and one-half (1 1/2) miles of the corporate limits of the Village may be served
with water supply from individual wells, except that individual wells shall be
permitted in subdivisions annexed to the Village after the effective date
hereof only after being specifically approved by the Village Board when it is
determined that connection with a public or community water supply system is
not practicable, or there is an agreement between the subdivider and the
Village and a guarantee by the subdivider that all lots in the subdivision will
be served with a public or community water system within a specified period of
time.
   B.   All water distribution systems shall be constructed in accordance with
standards approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Village
Engineer.
      1.   There shall be no physical connection between a potable and non-

as water, sewer and gas mains, house services connections therewith, and all
underground conduits for electric and telephone lines shall be completely
installed in place and approved.
      4.   When considered necessary by the Village Engineer, settlement of all
trench backfill shall be accelerated by means of water introduced through holes
jetted into backfilled trenches to a point approximately two feet (2') above
the top of the sewer pipe. The holes shall be jetted not greater than six feet
(6') apart unless otherwise directed by the Village Engineer. The jetting
process shall conform to the standards set forth in the State of Illinois
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, section 603.08. Any
depressions which develop within the street right of way due to settlement of
backfilling material shall be refilled and repaved at the subdivider's expense
for the trenching, in a manner acceptable to the Village Engineer.
      5.   The surface course of the roadway pavement shall not be laid until
backfilling of all trenches dug across the roadway has completely settled or
compacted to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. Said trenches shall be
backfilled with suitable material, mechanically tamped in eighteen inch (18")
lifts, and brought to the required grade. The surface course shall not be laid
until at least six (6) months after the base course is completed.

6-5-1: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES OR FOR PAYMENTS OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, each subdivider or
developer may be required to dedicate land for school sites to serve the
immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or cash
contributions in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at
the option of the village, when in the discretion of the village the
development will impact the applicable school districts, in accordance with the
following criteria and formula: (Ord. 2006-34, 8-22-2006)
   A.   Criteria For Requiring School Site Land Dedication:
      1.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to
be generated by the subdivision shall bear directly upon the amount of land
required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement
shall be determined by obtaining a ratio of: a) estimated children to be served
in each school classification over the b) maximum recommended number of
students to be served in each school classification as stated herein, and then
applying such ratio to the c) minimum recommended number of acres for a school
site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof
shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school
sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school
classification.
      2.   School Classification And Size Of School Site: School
classifications and size of school sites within or serving the village shall be
determined in accordance with the following criteria:
 
                                             Minimum
                           Maximum Number   Number Of
                           Students For     Acres Of Land

By Grades                   Classification   Site For Such
                                             Classificati on
Elementary schools,
grades kindergarten through 600 students     17 acres
5 (K-5)
Junior high schools,        900 students     30 acres
grades 6 through 8 (6-8)
High schools, grades        1,500 students   60 acres
9 through 12 (9-12)
 
      3.   Location: The location of the site to be dedicated shall be
determined by the village board of trustees upon recommendation of the board of
education of the school district having or to have jurisdiction of the school
to be erected on the site taking into account the comprehensive school plan
and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district as a guideline in
locating sites. The village board of trustees shall not select the site without
allowing opportunity for the board of education of the school district affected
to make a recommendation with respect thereto. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
   B.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of School Sites:
      1.   Requirement And Use Of Contributions: Where the development is
small, as used herein, and the resulting site is too small to be practicable or
when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, and it is
determined by the village not to require the dedication of land, the village
may require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
the land dedication. In considering whether a development is small, as used
herein, the village may consider whether the total number of the proposed
dwelling units will produce less than the maximum number of students for one
school of each school classification in accordance with this chapter. The cash
contributions in lieu of school sites shall be paid to the village prior to the
issuance of building permits, and shall be determined based on the fair market
value of land, the demographic information and school site size requirements in
effect at the time of application for the building permit. The village shall
turn over any and all funds actually collected for such fees to the appropriate
school districts annually. Such contributions shall be used solely for the
acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate and future needs
of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement to any
existing school sites and buildings which serve such needs. Improvement under
this section shall be liberally construed and shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the development of parking lots; sidewalks; traffic signals;
arterial streets; collector streets; internal roadways; connections with sewer,
water and electrical lines; playgrounds; recreation grounds; and athletic
fields. Improvement shall also include the purchase of any material, goods or
equipment necessary to said development and construction. Improvement shall
further include the construction of buildings; additions to existing school
buildings; remodeled or renovated noninstructional spaces in classrooms and the
purchase of prefabricated classroom units to be used at a school site. (Ord.
2006-34, 8-22-2006)
      2.   Fair Market Value As Basis Of Contribution: The cash contributions
in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in
the area improved as specified in this section that otherwise would have been
dedicated as school sites. It has been determined that the present fair market
value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is forty five
thousand dollars ($45,000.00) per acre and such figure shall be used in making
the calculation for school contributions unless the subdivider or developer
files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection the
subdivider or developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value
of such improved land in the area of his subdivision or other evidence thereof
and final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved
land shall be made by the village board based upon such information submitted
by the subdivider and from other sources which may be submitted to the village
board by the school districts or others. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995; amd. Ord.
2002-16, 5-28-2002; Ord. 2006-27, 6-27-2006; Ord. 2012-21, 8-28-2012)
   C.   Criteria For Requiring Land Dedication And A Contribution: There will
be situations in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a
contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise
when:
      1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid,
and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional
land that would have been required to be dedicated.
      2.   A major part of the school site has already been acquired and only a
small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The
remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in
lieu thereof shall also be required to fulfill the obligations of that
development. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-2: DENSITY:
The following table of population is generally indicative of current and short
range projected trends in family size for newly constructed residential units
as determined by the Illinois school consulting service and shall be used in
calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash
contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by
the subdivider. In the event a subdivider files a written objection to the
table of estimated ultimate population listed below, he shall submit his own
demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated
from the subdivision, and, in that event, final determination of the density
formula shall be based upon such demographic information submitted by the
subdivider, and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board,
and upon consideration of such information as most accurately and fairly
represents current demographic trends. It is recognized that population
density, age distribution, and local conditions change over the years, and the
specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.

Note:   There are only 3 significant categories provided in this chart. Because
of the similarity of yields of all types of attached single-family dwelling
units, only 1 category is provided. The same is true with apartments; thus only
1 category. Because of the relatively short history of some newer types of
detached and attached single-family units, individual evaluations may be
necessary.
(Ord. 2002-16, 5-28-2002)
6-5-3: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES:
Nothing herein contained shall limit the authority of the village to require
the designation and reservation of school sites, or other public lands as a
condition to approval of any plat of subdivision where such land is to be
acquired by condemnation within one year from final plat approval as set forth
under division 12 of article 11 of the Illinois municipal code1. 65 ILCS.1.
(Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-4: COMBINATION WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENT:
Where the subdivision is less than forty (40) acres, a school site which is to
be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from
adjoining subdivisions in order to produce usable school sites without hardship
on a particular subdivider. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-5: TOPOGRAPHY AND GRADING:
The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its
surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose. Grading on sites
dedicated for school uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. (Ord.
1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-6: IMPROVED SITES:
All school sites donated pursuant to this chapter shall be fully improved by
the subdivider. All property dedicated shall be in a fully improved condition
ready for service of electricity, gas, water and sewer service; streets,
including sidewalks, enclosed drainage, curbs and gutters shall be installed in
compliance with the ordinances of the village. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-7: PREREQUISITE TO ANNEXATION AGREEMENT:
The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof or combination of
both as required by this chapter may also be required as a condition to the
annexation of any land to the village when in the discretion of the village the
development will impact the applicable school districts, and provisions
therefor shall be incorporated in any annexation agreement governing such land.
Additionally, the village shall notify the appropriate school districts when a
party submits a proposed annexation agreement to the village and the village
determines there will be an impact, so that the school districts may discuss
dedication issues with said party. (Ord. 2006-34, 8-22-2006)
6-5-8: TIME OF PAYMENT:
The dedication of land shall be made at the time of final plat approval by the
board of trustees of the proposed subdivision. Cash contributions shall be made
at the time of the issuance of the building permits for the subject residential
dwelling units. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-9: METHOD OF PAYMENT:
The cash contributions required hereunder shall be made by check payable to the
village and shall be deposited with the village. The village clerk shall keep a
record of these receipts. (Ord. 1995-29, 9-26-1995)
6-5-10: INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS AND RELEASE:

6-6-1: DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS OR FOR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, each subdivider or
developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreation purposes to
serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or
cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both,
at the option of the village in accordance with the following criteria and
formula: (Ord. 2003-07, 2-25-2003)
   A.   Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreational Land Dedication:
      1.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be twenty five (25) acres of land per
one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following
classifications:
 
Types Of           Size Range       Minimum Acres
Recreation Areas                    Per 1,000 People
a. Play lot        Minimum 12,000   Not applicable
                   square feet
b. School-park     Minimum park
(neighborhood      of 5 acres       5.83
playground)
c. Neighborhood    Minimum 31/2     4.17
park               acres
d. Districtwide    Minimum 4 acres  5.83
park or play field up to 30 acres
e. Community wide  Minimum 12 acres 9.17
recreation park    up to 30 acres                     
                                    25 acres of land
                                    per 1,000 people
 
   (Ord. 2003-07, 2-25-2003; amd. Ord. 2006-18, 4-11-2006; Ord. 2013-25, 9-24-
2013)
      2.   Location: The location of the site to be dedicated shall be
determined by the board of trustees upon recommendation of the planning and
zoning commission taking into account the suitability of the site for park and
recreational purposes or development and its relationship to population
concentrations. A park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less
than five (5) acres shall be considered a requirement. A central location which
will serve equally the entire development is more desirable. In large
developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to
the village of Minooka comprehensive plan.
      3.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: When
subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and
facilities, it may have the effect of reducing the demand for local public
recreational services. The reason for this policy is understood to be the
village's concern that such private open space is difficult or impossible to
develop and maintain, irrespective of the developers' assurances, since
ownership usually is surrendered to the adjacent owners or a homeowners'
association, who may not have the personnel or the financial resources for
maintenance and improvement. There may, nevertheless, be instances in which the
public is better served by providing for private open space in lieu of public
open space. Credit for private open space may be allowed only where a
determination has been made by the village board of trustees that private open
space or recreational areas, in lieu of or in conjunction with publicly
dedicated open space or recreational areas will, by reason of the type of
development, better serve the interests of the public than where wholly public
dedications are required. Where allowed, a substitution of private open space
for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and
the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the
developer, as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including
specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village,
and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or
developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be
permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal
documents. Private swimming clubs and any other private recreation facilities
are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation acres
is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication
that would have been required from the subdivision and then subtract the credit
to be given. In all cases the extent of credit to be given by private open
space shall be determined by the village board of trustees.
   B.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Park And Recreational
Land Dedication:
      1.   Requirement And Use Of Contributions: Where the development is small
and the resulting site is too small to be practicable or when the available
land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes, the village shall
require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the
land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation
land dedication shall be paid to the village prior to or upon the issuance of
building permits for any building or structure in the subdivision, and shall be
determined based on the fair market value of land, the demographic information
and park site size requirements in effect at the time of application for the
building permit. Such contributions shall be used solely for the acquisition of
park and recreation land as hereinabove classified, which will be available to
serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or for
the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already
serves such needs. (Ord. 2003-07, 2-25-2003)
      2.   Fair Market Value As Basis Of Contribution: The cash contributions
in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in
the area improved as specified in this section that otherwise would have been
dedicated as park and recreation sites. It has been determined that the present
fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is forty
five thousand dollars ($45,000.00) per acre and such figure shall be used in
making any calculation herein unless the subdivider files a written objection
thereto. In the event of any such objection the subdivider shall submit an
appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of
his subdivision or other evidence thereof and the final determination of the
fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village
board based upon such information submitted by the subdivider and from other
sources which may be submitted to the village board. (Ord. 2003-07, 2-25-2003;
amd. Ord. 2005-60, 11-22-2005; Ord. 2012-21, 8-28-2012)
      3.   Criteria For Requiring Land Dedication And A Contribution: There
will be situations in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a
contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise
when:
         a.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as a
location of a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land
that would have been required to be dedicated.
         b.   A major part of the park site has already been acquired and only
a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site.
The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and cash contribution
in lieu thereof shall be required. (Ord. 2003-07, 2-25-2003)
6-6-2: DENSITY:
The following table of population is generally indicative of current and short
range projected trends in family size for newly constructed residential units
as determined by the Illinois school consulting service and shall be used in
calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash
contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by
the subdivider. In the event a subdivider files a written objection to the
table of estimated ultimate population listed below, he shall submit his own
demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated
from the subdivision, and, in that event, final determination of the density
formula shall be based upon such demographic information submitted by the
subdivider, and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board,
and upon consideration of such information as most accurately and fairly
represents current demographic trends. It is recognized that population
density, age distribution, and local conditions change over the years, and the
specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.

6-7-7: CHANGES:
A planned unit development shall be constructed in complete accordance with the
approved preliminary and final plat of planned unit development and all
supporting data. Major changes to an approved preliminary or final plat of
planned unit development require the resubmission and reconsideration of the
planned unit development according to the process set forth herein for
preliminary and final plat approval. With the aid of the following criteria,
the Zoning Officer shall be responsible for determining whether a change is
classified as major or minor. Minor changes shall, at the direction of the
Zoning Officer, be brought before the Planning and Zoning Commission for final
action but shall not require a new public hearing.
   A.   Criteria For Major Change: A major change is one that alters the
concept or intent of the planned unit development. This includes, but is not
limited to:
      1.   For A Residential PUD:
         a.   Any change in the location, size or type of dwelling units or
land uses.
         b.   Any increase in the number of dwelling units from that in the
approved preliminary plat.

6-7-8: DESIGN INCENTIVES:
To further creativity and excellence in design, the following incentives are
offered in planned unit developments:
   A.   Varied Zoning Requirements: Bulk requirements of the underlying zoning
district(s) may be varied provided that it can be demonstrated that the
variations conform to all of the review criteria contained herein as well as
those established for conditional uses and those established for subdivision
plats.
   B.   Varied Subdivision Requirements: Dimensional and design standards for
subdivisions and subdivision improvements such as streets, blocks, sidewalks,
and parkways may vary from Village and IDOT standards established or referenced
in the Village subdivision regulations provided that it can be demonstrated
that the variations conform to all of the review criteria contained herein as
well as those established for conditional permitted uses and those established
for subdivision plats. Required subdivision improvements may not vary from the
required construction improvement specifications.
   C.   Mixed Uses: A PUD may include a variety of land uses designed and
planned as part of a unified development provided that the underlying zoning
conforms to the uses being proposed. A residential PUD in an R District may
include up to ten percent (10%) of the gross site area devoted to uses
permitted in the B1 Zoning District.
   D.   On-Site Density Transfer: The density permitted in a given portion of a
total site may be transferred to another portion of the site in order to
preserve environmentally sensitive areas and to achieve excellence in design
provided that the gross density does not exceed the maximum allowed herein for
the underlying zoning district.
   E.   Density Bonuses: Design excellence in the provision of site amenities
such as exceptional landscaping, recreational facilities, preservation of
architectural and historic sites, and the preservation of environmentally
sensitive areas may allow the granting of an increase in density of up to five
percent (5%).
Flexibility to suspend requirements imposed by the Village's zoning and
subdivision regulations is not conferred upon the PUD applicant as a matter of
right, but in all cases subject to the finding by the Village that the
objectives of these provisions are being served by the PUD and that all
applicable review standards are being adhered to. Variations in a PUD from
normally applicable standards shall not be considered as variances as defined
in this Title and shall not be required to conform to the approval criteria
herein provided for variances. (Ord. 1997-08, 5-27-1997)
6-7-9: DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

feet (15').
      3.   The minimum distance between buildings greater than twenty four feet
(24') in height shall be equal to the height of the taller building.
   C.   Yards: The required yards along the periphery of the PUD shall be at
least equal to that of the underlying zoning district. (Ord. 1997-08, 5-27-
1997)
6-7-10: REVIEW CRITERIA:
The Planning and Zoning Commission's review of the preliminary and final PUD
applications shall be based on the following criteria:
   A.   The PUD shall not in any way be deemed to be detrimental to the public
health, safety, comfort or general welfare.
   B.   The plan of the area proposed for the PUD shall be in general
conformance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan of the Village.

otherwise held liable for such damage unless the village proves that the person
failed to comply with any of the protective measures set out in the approved
tree preservation plan. If the village proves that the person failed to comply
with any of the protective measures set out in the tree preservation plan, the

the peace and quiet of any person. For the purpose of this section, unusual or
prolonged noise shall include, but not be limited to, animal noise which
continues in a substantially uninterrupted manner for ten (10) minutes or more
or which occurs more than five (5) times in one hour. The mailing of a notice
to a keeper of an animal that such animal has engaged in unusual or prolonged

shall be the duty at the owner's expense to have the animal examined by a
physician or licensed veterinarian at the commencement and termination of the
ten (10) day period. If such animal, during this period, shall die or shall
show definite signs of illness, it shall be the duty of the owner or person
having custody of the animal to turn the dog over to the police chief or his
designee or animal control department so that it can be determined whether or
not the dog has rabies. Inoculated animals may be quarantined in the home of
the owner if the bite is below the shoulders, and, after inspection by the
police chief or his designee or animal control department, the location is
deemed satisfactory for confinement. (Ord. 2006-36, 10-10-2006)
8-4-12: VICIOUS DOG:
   A.   Vicious Dog Determination: In order to have a dog deemed vicious, the
police chief or his designee or animal control department must give notice of
the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner, conduct a
thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the owner, gather
any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or behavioral
evidence, and make a detailed report recommending a finding that the dog is a
vicious dog and give the report to the state's attorney's office and the owner.
The police chief or his designee, animal control department, state's attorney,
or any citizen of the county in which the dog exists may file a complaint in
the circuit court to deem a dog to be a vicious dog. Testimony of a certified
applied behaviorist, a board certified veterinary behaviorist, or another
recognized expert may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the
dog's behavior was justified. The petitioner must prove the dog is a vicious
dog by clear and convincing evidence. The police chief or his designee or
animal control department shall determine where the animal shall be confined
during the pendency of the case. If a dog is found to be a vicious dog, the dog
shall be spayed or neutered within ten (10) days of the finding at the expense
of its owner and microchipped, if not already, and is subject to enclosure. A
dog found to be a vicious dog shall not be released to the owner until the
police chief or his designee or animal control department approves the
enclosure. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog
without court approval. Whenever an owner of a vicious dog relocates, he or she
shall notify the police chief or his designee and animal control department and
the administrator of the county animal control where he or she has relocated.
   B.   Justified Conduct: A dog shall not be declared vicious if the court
determines the conduct of the dog was justified because:
      1.   The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the
time was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog,
or upon the property of the owner or custodian of the dog;
      2.   The injured, threatened, or killed person was tormenting, abusing,
assaulting, or physically threatening the dog or its offspring, or has in the
past tormented, abused, assaulted, or physically threatened the dog or its
offspring; or
      3.   The dog was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself,
its owner, custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
   C.   Exceptions: No dog shall be deemed vicious if it is a professionally
trained dog for law enforcement or guard duties. Vicious dogs shall not be

that shall not injure the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration.
   B.   Justified Conduct: A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the police

      2.   The threatened person was tormenting, abusing, assaulting, or
physically threatening the dog or its offspring;

determination. The proceeding shall be conducted as a civil hearing pursuant to

discovery provisions. After a hearing, the court may make a determination of
dangerous dog upon proof by clear and convincing evidence. The determination of
the circuit court may be appealed pursuant to the civil appeals provisions of

times during the appeal process, the owner shall comply with the requirements
set forth by the police chief or his designee, animal control department or the
court. (Ord. 2006-36, 10-10-2006)

8-7-5: PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING:
If the owner of a motor vehicle seized pursuant to this chapter requests a
probable cause hearing, said owner must make a request for said probable cause
hearing within forty eight (48) hours of the seizure and impoundment. Said
request shall be made in person and in writing at the police department
administrative offices, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, nine o'clock
(9:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. using the probable cause tow hearing
request form. If the request for a probable cause hearing is timely filed, the
chief of police or his designee shall conduct such probable cause hearing
within twenty four (24) hours after the request, or by a date mutually
agreeable to the parties, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, nine
o'clock (9:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. All interested persons shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the probable cause hearing. The
formal rules of evidence will not apply and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible. If, after the probable cause hearing, the chief of police or his
designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle
is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the chief of
police or his designee shall order the continued impoundment of the motor
vehicle, as provided in this chapter, unless the owner of the motor vehicle
posts with the village a cash bond as set forth in section

proceedings, the village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal service, the owner of record of the date, time and
location of an administrative hearing, unless the owner affirmatively waives
the right to a hearing. The notice shall state the fees that may be imposed,
and that a motor vehicle not released by cash bond and remaining in the village
may be sold or disposed of by the village in accordance with applicable law.
The hearing shall be conducted and held, unless the motor vehicle was subject
to successful forfeiture proceedings pursuant to applicable state or federal
forfeiture laws, no later than forty six (46) days after the motor vehicle was
seized, unless continued by the owner or by order of the hearing officer; or
unless the motor vehicle was subject to unsuccessful forfeiture proceedings, in
which case the hearing shall be conducted and held, unless continued by the
owner or by order of the hearing officer, no later than forty six (46) days
after the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings. The hearing officer shall
be an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Illinois for a minimum
of three (3) years. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date,
the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to
appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not
apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the
hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the
motor vehicle, operated with the permission, express or implied, of the owner,
was used in the commission of any of the violations set forth in this chapter,
and that none of the exceptions apply, the hearing officer shall enter an order
finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the village
for an administrative fee in the amount as set forth in section
8-7-3 of this chapter, which shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
village. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing
officer shall enter a default order finding the owner of record of the motor
vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount
as set forth in section
8-7-3 of this chapter, which shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
village, and a copy of which default order shall be sent to the registered
owner via certified mail, return receipt requested. If a cash bond has been
posted, the bond shall be applied. If a motor vehicle has been impounded when
such administrative fee is imposed, the village may seek to obtain a judgment
on the debt and enforce such judgment against the motor vehicle as provided by
law. However, if the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the
hearing officer shall order the return of the motor vehicle or cash bond, but
the owner shall be responsible for any towing and storage charges. All final
decisions of the hearing officer shall be subject to review under the
provisions of 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., the
administrative review law. (Ord. 2011-30, 12-20-2011)
8-7-7: FAILURE TO PAY:

   B.   Within thirty five (35) days after entry of an administrative fee
against an owner of record after an administrative hearing and the owner did
not file a petition for administrative review, or
   C.   Within thirty five (35) days after an action seeking administrative
review has been resolved in favor of the village,
the village shall be authorized to dispose of said vehicle (including contents
and license plates) in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed motor vehicles. (Ord. 2011-30, 12-20-2011)

10-1A-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights of way and the village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased storm water runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public
rights of way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   E.   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   H.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 2007-56, 12-19-2007)

rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.
   D.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. 2007-56, 12-19-2007)
10-1A-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village clerk within ninety
(90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or
plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with section 10-1A-21 of this chapter.
If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord.
2007-56, 12-19-2007)
10-1A-8: INSURANCE:
   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or
constructing any facility in the right of way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
consultants, agents, representatives, and employees as additional insureds on
the policies listed in subsections A1 and A2 of this section.
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village clerk within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies

deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and
appointed officers, officials, consultants, agents, representatives, and
employees harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands,
judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and
costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise
out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions,
failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of
facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering
service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct
or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives. (Ord. 2007-56, 12-19-2007)
10-1A-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village
clerk in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the village board, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the village board. Any surety bond or letter of credit
provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village clerk and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the superintendent of public works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs, including attorney fees, that the
village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform
such restoration. The reasonably estimated cost as described above shall be
multiplied by one hundred twenty five percent (125%) to establish the security
fund amount. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each
phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase
or phases, the superintendent of public works may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall
be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any
single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2007-56, 12-
19-2007)

structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         d.   The proposed method of attachment;
         e.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         f.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;

to the risk involved.
   H.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right of way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed. (Ord. 2007-
56, 12-19-2007; amd. Ord. 2020-8, 2-25-2020)
10-1A-16: CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS:

misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or
upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights of
way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;

with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
superintendent of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The superintendent of public works
may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the superintendent of public works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Denial Of A Variance: A permit shall be deemed rejected and, if
applicable, the forty five (45) day time period as set forth in section 10-1A-
5 of this chapter shall be immediately tolled, upon the right of way manager's
denial of a request for a variance.
   F.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the
superintendent of public works under the provisions of this chapter, shall have
the right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as
the village board may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted
in writing to the village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such
order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence
its consideration of the appeal at the village board's next regularly scheduled
meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The
village board shall timely decide the appeal by a vote of a majority of the
commissioners present at said meeting. (Ord. 2007-56, 12-19-2007)

any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine not less than
one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code; and a separate violation shall be deemed committed for each
violation, and on each day during and on which a violation occurs or continues.
There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including
third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties
under its permit and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the
utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review
or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may
be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord.
2007-56, 12-19-2007)
10-1A-23: ENFORCEMENT:

requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. If the
applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant shall
provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits
or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria
in this paragraph.

wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
      1.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of- way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
      2.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
   I.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height for a
new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the
small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply
for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth
in section
10-1A-21 of this title in the case of construction/installation within the
Village right-of-way and in cases in industrial or commercial districts outside
of the Village right-of-way as provided in section

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability. (Ord. 2018-25, 8-28-2018)

wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to
the collocation of any wireless facility. A wireless provider may self-insure
all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by
the Village. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the
extent of the self- insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of
additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to

      3.   Commercial Business Rate:
         a.   Population Equivalent To Be Provided: Each applicant for a
commercial business tap or connection shall provide the Village with an
estimate of the population equivalent of the anticipated commercial use. One
“population equivalent” is defined to be the use of one hundred (100) gallons
of water per day.
         b.   Minimum Fee: A minimum fee of four thousand nine hundred dollars
($4,900.00) shall be charged for any tap or connection with an estimated
population equivalent of up to and including 3.5 (i.e., an anticipated use of
up to 350 gallons per day). In the event that the estimated population
equivalent exceeds 3.5, an additional fee of one thousand four hundred dollars
($1,400.00) shall apply for each estimated population equivalent, or portion
thereof, in excess of the aforementioned 3.5 (this fee shall not be pro-rated).
Once the applicant pays the tap or connection fee based upon their submitted
estimated population equivalent, the applicant’s “estimated population
equivalent” shall become the “allocated use” associated with the premises,
subject to the change in use provision set forth in subsection A3c of this
section. The amount of this fee shall automatically increase by five percent
(5%) annually beginning on May 1, 2025.
         c.   Change In Use:
         (1)   If, at any time after the owner of any premises has paid the
connection fee and established a commercial water service tap for said premises
as provided for in subsection A3b of this section, the owner of said premises
applies for a subsequent building permit for any project that will likely
result in a water use population equivalent in excess of the allocated use
associated with said premises, such building permit shall not be approved or
issued until the applicant pays any required change in use fee as set forth in
subsection A3c(3) of this section.
         (2)   In the event that the Building Officer and inspector for the
Village determines that the issuance of a building permit is likely to increase
the population equivalent of the actual use on any given premises above the
allocated use associated with said premises, the Building Officer shall, before
granting or issuing said permit, instruct the applicant to provide the Village
with an estimate of the population equivalent of the anticipated use on the
premises after the project for which the building permit has been requested has
been completed.
         (3)   In the event that the applicant’s estimated population
equivalent, as set forth in subsection A3a of this section, exceeds the
allocated use associated with the premises, the building inspector shall assess
a change in use fee in the amount of one thousand four hundred dollars
($1,400.00) for each population equivalent, or portion thereof, that the
estimated population equivalent exceeds the allocated use associated with the
premises (this fee shall not be pro-rated). The amount of this fee shall
automatically increase by five percent (5%) annually beginning on May 1, 2025.
         (4)   Once the applicant pays any change in use fee, as required by
subsection A3c(3) of this section, the estimated population equivalent that
gave rise to said fee shall become the new “allocated use” associated with the
premises.
      At the time an application is made for a building permit for a single-
family residence, tap on fee shall be paid to the Village Clerk.
      The expense of labor and materials to install said tap or connection, to

discharge of up to 350 gallons per day). In the event that the estimated
population equivalent exceeds 3.5, an additional fee of one thousand four
hundred dollars ($1,400.00) shall apply for each estimated population
equivalent, or portion thereof, in excess of the aforementioned 3.5 (this fee
shall not be pro-rated). Once the applicant pays the tap or connection fee
based upon their submitted estimated population equivalent, the applicant’s
“estimated population equivalent” shall become the “allocated capacity”
associated with the premises. The amount of this fee shall automatically
increase by five percent (5%) annually beginning on May 1, 2025.
         c.   Change In Use:
         (1)   If, at any time after the owner of any premises has paid the
connection fee and established a commercial sewerage service tap for said
premises as provided for in subsection B3b of this section, the owner of said
premises applies for a subsequent building permit for any project that will
likely result in a sewage discharge population equivalent in excess of the
allocated capacity associated with said premises, such building permit shall
not be approved or issued until the applicant pays any required change in use
fee as set forth in subsection B3c(3) of this section.
         (2)   In the event that the Building Officer and inspector for the
Village determines that the issuance of a building permit is likely to increase
the population equivalent of the actual discharge generated by any given
premises above the allocated capacity associated with said premises, the
Building Officer shall, before granting or issuing said permit, instruct the
applicant to provide the Village with an estimate of the population equivalent
of the anticipated rate of discharge that will be generated by the premises
after the project for which the building permit has been requested has been
completed.
         (3)   In the event that the applicant’s estimated population
equivalent, as set forth in subsection B3a of this section, exceeds the
allocated capacity associated with the premises, the building inspector shall
assess a change in use fee in the amount of one thousand four hundred dollars
($1,400.00) for each population equivalent, or portion thereof, that the
estimated population equivalent exceeds the allocated capacity associated with
the premises (this fee shall not be pro-rated). The amount of this fee shall
automatically increase by five percent (5%) annually beginning on May 1, 2025.
         (4)   Once the applicant pays any change in use fee, as required by
subsection B3c(3) of this section, the estimated population equivalent that

   A.   Purposes: The purpose of these rules and regulations is:
      1.   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system.
      2.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water system and
nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources of systems containing
substances of unknown or questionable safety.
      3.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer's potable water systems.
   B.   Application: These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the Village.
   C.   Policy: The owner or official custodian of premises served by the
public potable water supply system of the Village shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the Superintendent or his authorized
representative, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the
safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent shall give notice
to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention device at each
service connection to the premises. The consumer shall immediately install such
approved device or devices at his own expense; failure, refusal or inability on
the part of the consumer to install such device or devices immediately shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such
device or devices have been installed. The consumer shall retain records of
installation, maintenance, testing and repair as required in subsection
10-4-9-5D4 of this Chapter for a period of at least five (5) years. The
Superintendent may require the consumer to submit a cross-connection inspection
report to the Village to assist in determining whether or not service line
protection will be required. All cross-connection inspections shall be
conducted by a cross-connection control device inspector certified by the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. (Ord. 1992-3, 2-11-1992)
