effectiveness of ordinances included in said official Village Code. All
ordinances of a special nature, such as tax levy ordinances, bond ordinances,
franchises, vacating ordinances and annexation ordinances shall continue in
full force and effect unless specifically repealed or amended by a provision of

Village to be misrepresented thereby.

or in conflict with this ordinance are hereby repealed. If any of the

and any member of the Board of Trustees of the village ("Board") may attend any
open or closed meeting of the Board via electronic means (such as by telephone,
video or internet connection) provided that such attendance is in compliance
with these rules and any applicable laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Board may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The member should notify the Village Clerk at least three hours
before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance.
      (2)   The member must assert one of the following four reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability;
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the village;
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency;
or
         (d)   The member cannot attend because of unexpected childcare
obligations.
   (C)   Authorization to participate.
      (1)   The Village Clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance
request, shall inform the Board of the request for electronic attendance.
      (2)   After establishing that there is a quorum physically present at a
meeting where a member of the Board desires to attend electronically, the
presiding officer shall state that: (i) a notice was received from a member of
the Board in accordance with these rules; and (ii) the member will be deemed
authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to
the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded and approved by two-thirds
of the members of the Board physically present at the meeting. If no such
motion is made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the required
vote by the members of the Board physically present at the meeting, then the
request by the member to attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed
approved by the Board and the presiding officer shall declare the requesting
member present. After such declaration by the presiding officer, the question
of a member's electronic attendance may not be reconsidered.
   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically
and other members of the Board must be able to communicate effectively, and
members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting
site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the Board shall
provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
offsite attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic
means.
   (F)   Rights of remote member. 
      (1)   A member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express
his or her comments during the meeting and participate in the same capacity as
those members physically present, subject to all general meeting guidelines and
procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The member attending
electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called
during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the Village
Clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member
attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any
member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her
leaving and returning.
      (2)   If the President is attending the meeting electronically, a member
who is physically present shall be chosen by a majority of the corporate
authorities attending the meeting to preside over the meeting. Such member
shall have only the rights and duties of a presiding officer, not Mayor Pro
Tem, and shall be entitled to vote only as a member. The mayor shall retain his
right to vote as provided by applicable law.
   (G)   Committees, Boards and Commissions. These rules shall apply to all
committees, boards and commissions established by authority of the Board.

penalties imposed by the village or other governmental agency resulting from
the licensee's performance or its failure to perform its duties and obligations

      (3)   All new or expanded subdivisions which require approval of the
village pursuant to the provisions of the Village of Mahomet Subdivision
Ordinance, as amended.
      (4)   Generally, any new construction within the village’s area of zoning
jurisdiction, pursuant to the provisions of the Village of Mahomet Zoning
Ordinance, that increases the amount of pervious area of the lot or parcel of
land upon which it is constructed.
      (5)   Except as may otherwise be provided herein, all structures erected
hereafter, all uses of land or structures established hereafter, all
improvements to water courses, all structural alterations or relocation of
existing structures occurring hereafter, and all enlargement of, or additions
to, existing uses which increase the amount of pervious area, occurring
hereafter, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. Therefore,
except as provided in §
51.03, no building permit may be issued, no subdivision or plat of land may be
approved or recorded; no mobile home, independent travel trailer, or
recreational travel trailer park permit may be issued; no planned unit
development may be approved; no watercourse, stormwater drainage system, storm
sewer, or stormwater control structure may be constructed; and no paved or
compacted area designed to be used for loading, open storage, or the parking or
movement of vehicles may be constructed without first having complied with the
applicable provisions of this stormwater management chapter.
   (B)   Whenever storage and controlled release of stormwater is required for
existing developed parcels, and where improvements upon such parcels were
constructed prior to 1972, such storage and the required controlled release
rate shall apply to the net increase in the amount of runoff since January 1,
1972.
   (C)   Any area proposed for development, consisting of a tract of land of
three or more acres in common ownership or interest and upon which phased
development is proposed, shall be required to provide a combination of storage
and controlled release of stormwater runoff for future development of the
entire tract.
      (1)   Where phased development is proposed, the owner may construct,
after receiving site specific approval from the Administrator, one stormwater
detention facility which is built larger than initially needed in order to
anticipate subsequent phases of development and/or is designed to be enlarged
at later dates as additional portions of the overall site are developed. Phased
construction shall include implementation of sufficient and enforceable
covenants upon the land to properly document the phased implementation. The
form of covenant shall be approved by the Village Attorney, and the substance
of the covenant shall reflect the approved overall stormwater detention plan
for the site.
      (2)   Where a subdivision plat or a planned unit development involves new
lots which are more than three acres in size that are zoned for commercial or
industrial purposes, the developer/owner may provide for storage and controlled
release of stormwater runoff for the developed lots by sufficient and
enforceable covenant upon the individual lots. The covenant shall require
construction of on-site stormwater detention facilities upon each lot at the
time of subsequent development of that lot. The form of covenant shall be
approved by the Village Attorney, and the substance of the covenant shall
require construction of on-site stormwater runoff storage and controlled
release of stormwater runoff from each lot in a manner approved by the
Administrator, and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Any property or development falling within the scope of the provisions
of this chapter shall be subject to review by the Administrator in order to
establish and determine, in the opinion of the Administrator,that no adverse
consequences will arise downstream as a result of construction of improvements
under the sought-after permit. Any property located within floodplain areas, as
defined in the flood hazard area development ordinance of the village shall be
governed by such ordinance in the event of and to the extent of conflict with
the provisions of this stormwater management ordinance.
   (E)   All applications for building permits shall contain a statement that
such buildings or structures and appurtenances connected therewith include
facilities for the orderly runoff or detention of rain and melting snow, as
required herein. Plans submitted with said application shall include a signed
statement issued by the owner and by an Illinois professional engineer that the
plans include facilities adequate to prevent hazardous runoff, as required
herein. For single family dwellings to be located in a subdivision meeting the
requirement of this chapter, the signed statement may, in lieu of the above
procedure, be placed on the face of the final plat or upon the required
subsidiary drainage plat for the entire subdivision.
   (F)   Existing conditions. 
      (1)   It is anticipated in this chapter that a land owner shall be
allowed to pass through existing excess stormwater runoff from tributary areas
upstream from that owner’s land without storage or controlled release of such
runoff. It is further anticipated that this chapter will require the controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff resulting from development on an owner’s
land. The controlled release rate of excess stormwater runoff from an owner’s
land shall not exceed the rate of runoff which would have occurred from that
owner’s land prior to the development or redevelopment of that owner’s land.
      (2)   It is presumed by this chapter that prior to development, the
owner’s land had a traditional agricultural use. It is further presumed that
the maximum safe stormwater drainage capacity for downstream stormwater
drainage systems is the capacity required to carry the peak rate of stormwater
runoff from a five year return period storm event prior to December 14, 1981.

liable for a deficiency or failure, regardless of cause, in the supply of water
or in the pressure, nor any damage caused thereby or by the bursting or
breaking of any main or service pipe or any attachment to the village’s
property. All customers having boilers upon their premises depending upon the
water pressure in the village’s water mains to keep them supplied are cautioned
against danger of collapse in the event of interruption of service. All damage
occasioned by any collapse must be borne exclusively by the consumer or
customer.
   (D)   The village shall have the sole right to determine the size of meters,
valves, service lines and connection necessary to give the service applied for.
   (E)   A temporary supply of water for building construction, lawn watering
or other similar purposes must be specifically applied for.
   (F)   All use of water other than by the applicant or for any purpose or
upon any premises not stated or described in the application, must be prevented
by him or her. The applicant will be liable for the amount of water used in
conformity with the schedule of rates of the village as may be established from
time to time.
   (G)   Service may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   For the use of water for any other property or purpose than that
described in the application;
      (2)   For misrepresentation in the application as to property or fixtures
to be supplied;

village.
   (H)   If a customer, whose service has been discontinued for nonpayment of
bills or for violation of the rules and regulations of the village, desires a
reconnection, the reconnection will only be made after the customer has:
      (1)   Made a deposit to assure future payment of bills (in cases only
where no deposit was originally made);
      (2)   Paid all unpaid bills for water service;
      (3)   Paid a reconnection fee as set from time to time by resolution of
the Village Board of Trustees; and
      (4)   Has corrected any condition found to be in violation of the rules
and regulations of the village.
   (I)   When weather conditions cause the water in the customer’s service line
to freeze, the village is not obligated to thaw the frozen water line to
restore water service to the customer or owner. Repair of damage to a service
line due to freezing or other external causes or repair of damage caused by
customer will be made by customer at customer’s expense.
   (J)   The village recognizes that at times the customer’s service line and
plumbing system is used as an electrical grounding electrode for electrical
circuits and devices. This method of grounding involves an element of danger
and is highly discouraged by the village. The village will not be liable for
the adequacy of this electrical grounding system and reserves the right to make
any structural or material changes it so desires in the installation of the
village’s water mains, water service connections and meters without regard to
the effect the changes may have on the overall adequacy of an electrical
grounding system utilizing the customer’s service line and plumbing system.
   (K)   The village will not permit anyone except an authorized employee of
the village to make any connection to or disconnection from the water main of
the village. The village also will not permit any unauthorized individuals to
set, change, remove, interfere with, bypass or make any connection to the
village’s water meter or other property. The customer and/or owner shall be
responsible for any violations of this rule and the consequences thereof,
including costs to repair damage to the village’s property.

§ 52.022 METERED WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   (1)   For new connections the village will provide at the customer’s
expense a suitable meter and remote meter reading device for each customer’s
water service connection. The village will determine the size and type of
meter. The meter and remote meter reading device will remain the sole property
of the village. The meter shall be installed by the customer’s plumber at the
customer’s expense in compliance with the village requirements and the Illinois
Plumbing Code. The village is not responsible for improper installations.
      (2)   Secondary meters for outside water use must be applied for and will
be furnished at a cost as set from time to time by resolution of the Village
Board of Trustees.
   (B)   Meters shall be conveniently located at the point approved by the
village. A curb stop shall be installed by the village at a point determined by
the village. A gate valve shall be installed by the customer on the village’s
side of the meter adjacent to the meter. A suitable check valve shall be
installed by the customer on the customer’s side of the meter if required by
the village. The owner and/or customer will provide at his or her expense a
clean, dry, safe place, not subject to a great variation in temperature, so
that the meter will be properly protected from freezing and other hazards, so
located as to control the entire supply, and as to be easily accessible for
installation, maintenance, reading and disconnection. The customer shall cause
to be placed, at the customer’s expense, a stop and waste valve on the service
pipe at or near the influent side of the meter and another stop or waste valve
on the service pipe at or near the effluent side of the meter. A backflow
prevention device may be required at the customer’s expense in accordance with
IEPA regulations and State Plumbing Code requirements. If so required, it will
be inserted at some convenient point on the customer’s plumbing to protect the
meter from excess pressure due to heating water or other circumstances.
   (C)    (1)   Acceptable meter locations, so long as they meet the preceding
requirements, include basements, utility rooms, furnace rooms, meter rooms and
garages. Unacceptable locations include closets, and under lavatory or kitchen
sinks. Meter boxes are acceptable only for mobile homes without permanent
foundations, buildings without heat; existing buildings that did not have water
service and do not have an adequate location for a water meter, and lawn or
garden watering systems.
      (2)   When one water service connection supplies one meter, the meter
must be located so that access to the customer’s meter is through the
customer’s own premises only. When one water service connection supplies
multiple meter installations, the meters must be located in a meter room (a
room specifically constructed for the meters) accessible from a common hallway,
separate outside entrance on grade, or outside of the customer’s premises.
      (3)   Where there are multiple meter installations located in a meter
box, a key box furnished by the village at its expense will be installed near
the door to the meter room. The building owner will furnish at the owner’s
expense a key to the door to the meter room which will be placed in the key
box.

at some convenient point on the house piping to relieve any excess pressure due
to heating water or other circumstances.
         (b)   Meters will be maintained by the village so far as ordinary wear
and tear is concerned, but damage due to hot water or external causes shall be
paid for by the customer. Meters and remote meter reading devices will be owned
and maintained by the village at the village’s expense for normal maintenance
requirements. Repair of damage due to freezing, hot water or external causes
which could have been prevented by ordinary precautions on the part of the
customer and repair of damage caused by the customer, will be paid for by the
customer. The amount charged for repair will be the actual cost of maintenance
and labor including removal, testing and overhead expenses.
         (c)   No water meter shall be placed in service, nor be allowed to
remain in service if it registers more than 102% or less than 98% of the water
which passes through it.
   (D)   The village reserves the right to remove and test any meter at any
time, and to substitute another meter in its place. In case of a disputed
account involving a question as to the accuracy of a meter, the meter will be
tested upon the request of the customer without charge, providing a
satisfactory test can be made in service. If removed for test, a charge as set
from time to time by resolution of the Village Board of Trustees must be
payable in advance of the test. In the event that the meter so tested is found
to have an error in registration in excess of 2%, the fee advanced for testing
will be refunded, and the bills shall be corrected accordingly on the basis of
one-fourth the time since the previous test. This correction shall apply both
for over and under registration.
   (E)   Where water is furnished by flat rate, the village shall have the
right to install, maintain and inspect a meter to determine the quantity
supplied and the applicant shall provide a suitable location therefor. The
village reserves the right to change from flat rate service to metered service
at any time under uniform, nondiscriminatory rules.

billing charge, a special charge, a capital improvement charge, a debt service
charge, and a user charge.
 
Billing charge
+ Special charge
+ Capital improvement charge
+ Debt service charge
+ User charge
Wastewater charge
 
   (B)   Billing charge. All users shall be assessed a separate charge per bill
to recover the costs of meter reading, processing bills, mailing costs, and
costs of collection. The billing charge shall be sufficient to recover the
costs related to billing the users of the wastewater facilities and shall be
charged as a fixed amount per bill.
   (C)   Special charge. Any user may be assessed a separate charge to recover
costs on a monthly basis for special circumstances or individual situations.
Items for which a special charge may be assessed include, but are not limited
to: costs of monitoring, inspections, sampling or testing assessed to a non-
residential user; capacity fees; local improvement project payments; past due
wastewater charges; finance charges from unpaid bills; and account
establishment charges. A special charge will be assessed and included on the
bill for wastewater charges only by arrangement between the village and the
individual user and will be clearly indicated on the bill.
   (D)   Capital improvement charge. All users shall be assessed a separate
charge to provide for capital improvements to the wastewater facilities for the
improvement, extension, construction or reconstruction of the wastewater
treatment works and collection system. The capital improvement charge shall be
computed by apportioning the annual amount to be accrued on the basis of a
fixed charge per user per month; or, by multiplying the capital improvement
rate by a user’s monthly billable flow. The capital improvement rate shall be
in units of cost per 100 gallons of billable flow and computed by dividing the
annual amount to be accrued by the annual billable flow.
   (E)   Debt service charge. All users shall be assessed a separate charge to
retire any and all debts, charges or costs of financing including principal and
interest payments, depreciation and reserve funds, bond maintenance,
assessments or other charges which have been incurred for the construction of
the wastewater facilities. The debt service charge shall be computed by
apportioning all annual costs of financing or debt service of all outstanding
loans, bonds, or obligations to be accrued on the basis of a fixed charge per
user per month; or, by multiplying the debt service rate by a user’s monthly
billable flow. The debt service rate shall be in units of cost per 100 gallons,
and computed by dividing the annual amount to be accrued by the annual billable
flow.
   (F)   User charge. All users shall be assessed a separate charge for the
operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the wastewater facilities
based on actual usage of the facilities (proportionate share of flow to the
facilities) and the relative strength of the wastewater discharged to the
facilities. The user charge shall be computed by multiplying the user rate by a
user’s monthly billable flow. The user rate shall be in units of cost per 100
gallons of billable flow and computed by dividing the annual amount to be
accrued by the annual billable flow. The wastewater usage charge shall be
increased by a waste strength multiplier for certain types of use. Users which
discharge non-domestic strength wastewater shall pay a wastewater usage charge
that is the standard charge multiplied by the waste strength multiplier set
forth in §
54.020.
(Ord. 18-04-01, passed 4-24-2018)
§ 54.017 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.

shall be owned by the village, but shall be installed and maintained in proper
working order by the user. The village shall designate the location of the
water meter and shall inspect its installation. Following village approval of
the water meter installation, the meter shall not be removed or altered without
the consent of the village.
   (C)   Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater discharged to the
wastewater facilities of the village may be required by the village if the
volume of water consumption cannot otherwise be determined from water meters or
metered water records.
   (D)   Non-metered residential users shall be assigned a monthly billable
flow of not less than 10,000 gallons per month.
   (E)   Non-metered commercial use shall be assigned a monthly billable flow
of not less than 15,000 gallons per month.

approved flow measuring devices as modified by a waste strength adjustment
procedure.
(Ord. 18-04-01, passed 4-24-2018)
§ 54.019 WASTE STRENGTH ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE.
   In order to more accurately apportion the costs of the wastewater facilities
of the village among its users, the relative strength of wastewater discharged
to the facilities must be considered. The base waste strength against which all
users shall be compared shall be normal domestic sewage. All users shall be
assigned a waste strength multiplier which, when multiplied by the adjusted
actual flow, will produce the user’s billable flow. For non-industrial users,
the waste strength multiplier shall be based on the biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) and suspended solids (SS) characteristics of the waste stream only. The
waste strength multiplier of industrial users may be based on other
considerations and waste constituents and shall be determined by the village on
an individual basis. A user’s waste strength multiplier shall not be less than
1.0 and shall be determined by one of the fo1llowing methods:
   (A)   Standard classification system. The village shall assign all non-
industrial users a waste strength multiplier in accordance with an officially
adopted classification schedule.
      (1)   Schedule.

      (2)   The Village Engineer shall determine the waste strength multiplier
for any use classification not listed herein based upon industry standards or
via sampling and testing of the wastewater.
   (B)   Sampling and testing method. Any user disagreeing with the village’s
assignment of a waste strength factor from the standard classification system
may request an individual determination of actual waste strength based on
sampling and testing. The user requesting the individual determination shall
pay all costs associated with sampling and testing of the wastewater strength
including, but not limited to: access to waste piping including installation of
a manhole; acquisition of appropriate grab samples or composite samples;
testing for constituent concentrations; staff, Village Engineer or other
designated representative’s time; and all related expenses. The village shall
establish appropriate policies and procedures in advance of sampling and
testing. The waste strength multiplier to be assigned to a user based on
sampling and testing shall be determined in accordance with the following
relations:
 
Waste strength multiplier = BOD ratio + SS ratio         >1.0
                            2
Where:
BOD ratio =                 Concentration of BOD in mg/l >1.0
                            200 mg/l
SS ratio =                  Concentration of SS in mg/l  >1.0

      (3)   Industries. The number of units shall be determined by applying to
the approved flow estimates made by the Engineer for the industry, and as
reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer and the Village Administrator.
The standard shall be of 0.2 pounds of biological oxygen demand and 100 gallons
of flow per one unit per day. Adjustments may also be made based upon suspended
solids and other elements of the wastewater. The capacity fee shall be the
number of units determined multiplied by the charge per unit. In the case of
industry, each charge is to be reviewed and adjusted at the end of the first
three years of full operation of the industry to the average annual operation
experience and settlement, therefore, shall be made within six months
thereafter.
      (4)   Multiple uses.
         (a)   Whenever a building or structure includes a combination of
multiple uses of more than one type of use (example - a bowling alley with a
bar) the capacity fee shall be determined by combining the estimated units for
each type of use and multiplying the number of units determined by the charge
per unit.
         (b)   Whenever a commercial property includes a building or structure
that is intended to contain a combination of multiple uses of more than one
type within several individual suites, than not less than the minimum capacity
fee shall be due at the time of initial building construction. As subsequent
suites within the building are occupied and the use within that suite
determined, an additional capacity fee shall be due and payable consistent with
the actual use of that suite.
      (5)   Other uses. All other uses not herein above classified are to be
determined by the Village Administrator with the recommendation of the Village
Engineer. The number of units shall be determined by considering the amount of
flow for the user and utilizing the standards of 0.2 pounds of biological
oxygen demand and 100 gallons of flow per one unit per day. The Village
Engineer shall use standard estimates of usage as published by the Illinois EPA
or other reputable sources when making his estimates of usage. The capacity fee
shall be the number of units determined multiplied by the charge per unit.
      (6)   Appeal of determination. In the event that the user disagrees with
the determination of the Village Administrator, the user may appeal that
decision to the Village of Mahomet Board of Trustees. The decision of the
Trustees shall be final.
   (B)   Minimum capacity fee. Regardless of the actual use of a building or
the actual wastewater usage therein, the minimum capacity fee shall be based
upon a minimum wastewater usage of not less than two units.
   (C)   Annual review. The Board of Trustees will review and consider an
increase to the capacity fee, annually, prior to May 1. If an increase is found
to be necessary, such increase would be effective May 1.
   (D)   Existing connections. A credit shall be given to the applicant for the
number of units being served through an existing private sewer connected to the
village facilities at the time the reconstruction or remodeling of the building
then served and/or to be served is commenced. This credit is to be applied
against the capacity fee charged. When the credit exceeds the capacity fee to
be charged, no refund of the excess will be issued.
   (E)   Permits. No connection of a private sanitary sewer extension or
building sewer shall be made to an existing village public sanitary sewer or to
another existing private sewer or building sewer draining to the village
wastewater treatment plant until the plans and specifications of said sewer
extension have been approved by the Village Administrator, or a designated
representative; a written permit for the connection has been issued by the
village; and the capacity fee therefore has been paid in full by the applicant
to the Treasurer of the Village. See the Chapter 53: Sewer Regulations for
further details concerning application for and issuance of connection permits.

§ 54.051 PRIVATE WATER SERVICE CONNECTION FEES.
   (A)   Connection fees. There shall be a connection fee required to connect a
new private water connection to the village’s public water supply system. The
connection fee shall be determined per service type, and shall be as set from
time to time by the Village Board of Trustees.
 
Service Type
3/4 to 1 inch service lines
1-1/4 to 1- ½ inch service lines
1-3/4 or 2 inch service lines
Per unit of usage per day for service lines larger than 2 inches in diameter
Fire service line
Temporary service connection
   
   (B)   Determining units of water usage. A UNIT of water usage shall consist
of 75 gallons of flow per day. The number of units of water usage shall be
determined by applying the approved flow estimates made by the Engineer for the
industry or business, and as reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer and
the Village Administrator. The Village Engineer may consult with published
industry standards to determine an estimate of water usage. The connection fee
shall be the number of units determined multiplied by the charge per unit. In
the case of industry, each charge is to be reviewed and adjusted at the end of
the first three years of full operation of the industry to the average annual
operation experience and settlement, therefore, shall be made within six
months.
   (C)   Multiple uses. Whenever a commercial property includes a building or
structure that is intended to contain a combination of multiple uses of more
than one type within individual suites, then each individual suite shall be
separately metered for water use. The connection fee due at the time of
building construction shall be not less than the fee needed for the water
service line extended to each suite of that building.
   (D)   Appeal of determination. In the event that the user disagrees with the
determination of the Village Administrator, the user may appeal that decision
to the Board of Trustees of the Village of Mahomet. The decision of the Board
of Trustees shall be final.
   (E)   Existing connections. A credit shall be given to the applicant for the
number of units being served through an existing private water service
connected to the village facilities at the time the reconstruction or
remodeling of the building then served and/or to be served is commenced. This
credit is to be applied against the connection fee charged. When the credit
exceeds the connection fee to be charged, no refund of the excess will be
issued.
   (F)   Permits. No connection of a private water service line or building
water service line shall be made to an existing village public water main or to
another existing private water service line connected to the Mahomet public
water system until the plans and specifications of said water service line
extension have been approved by the Village Administrator, or a designated
representative; a written permit for the connection has been issued by the
village; and the connection fee therefore has been paid in full by the
applicant to the Treasurer of the Village of Mahomet. See the
Chapter 52: Water Use Regulations for further details concerning application
for and issuance of connection permits.

§ 54.052 SPECIAL PROJECT CONNECTION FEES.
   (A)   Special project connection fees.
      (1)   From time to time as may be warranted, the village may deem it
necessary to participate in the extension of sanitary sewer facilities or
public water main facilities to areas not currently served by village sanitary
sewers or water mains. Such extensions may be by participation in a local
improvement project, by agreement with some or all of the owners of the
properties to be served, or by other means.
      (2)   The Village of Mahomet may establish, by resolution of the Board of
Trustees, special project connection fees, which shall be charged in addition
to the normal connection fee outlined elsewhere herein. The special project
connection fee established shall be for the purpose of distributing the costs
of the water main extension or sanitary sewer extension to those properties
benefited by the extension in a fair and equitable manner.
      (3)   The special project connection fee may include the costs incurred
by the village on behalf of the property owners, including interest costs
incurred to the date of application. The properties that are benefited by the
facility extension and to which the special project connection fee is
applicable shall be identified by the village at the time of the establishment
of the fee.
      (4)   No connection of a private sanitary sewer extension or building
sewer shall be made to an existing village sanitary sewer until such time as
any special project connection fee due to the village has been paid. No
connection of a water service line shall be made to an existing village water
main until such time as any special project connection fee due to the village
has been paid. When the property benefited and to which the special project
connection fee is applicable includes land that is to be subdivided or
otherwise developed, the developer or subdivider of the property shall be
responsible for payment of all applicable special project connection fees prior
to connection of private sewers, public sanitary sewers, or building sewers to
the village public sanitary sewer system and prior to connection of water
service lines to the village water mains.
   (B)   Use of connection fees and capacity fees. Connection fees, capacity
fees and special project connection fees collected by the village shall be
deposited by the Treasurer of the Village in a Wastewater Capital Improvement
Fund or a Water System Capital Improvement Fund, as applicable for use in
extension, construction or reconstruction of the wastewater treatment works and
sanitary sewer collection system of the village or for use in the extension,
construction, or reconstruction of the village public water supply facilities.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 91.01 SUB-STREET UTILITY EXCAVATION AND TRENCH BACKFILL POLICY.
   The village sub-street utility excavation and trench backfill policy is
hereby established. The policy shall become effective as of January 1, 1995 and
shall consist of the following provisions.
   (A)   Beginning on January 1, 1995 and thereafter, all street open cut
trenches made either to existing pavements or sidewalks or in future pavement
areas shall be backfilled utilizing one of two recommended methods: those being
the use of controlled low strength materials (CLSM) or, alternately, the
placement of thin (six-inch maximum) mechanically compacted lifts of CAS or
CA10 aggregate materials as approved by the village. Water jetting of the
aggregate backfill material will not be permitted. The proper backfill material
shall extend not less than two feet in each direction from the edge of the
pavement.
   (B)   CLSM is defined as a mixture of Portland Cement, fly ash, fine
aggregate and water. The mix shall be proportioned to provide a backfill
material which is self-compacting and capable of being excavated with hand
tools, if necessary, at a later date. Materials and proportioning shall comply
with the State Department of Transportation’s Special Provision for Controlled
Low-Strength Material as adopted on January 1, 1990 and revised on March 1,
1990, as amended from time to time.
   (C)   For both the CLSM and granular backfill methods, the top 12 inches of
the excavation shall be filled with soil of similar composition to that of the
adjacent subgrade. The 12 inches of soil shall be compacted to at least 95% of
maximum dry density. (AASHTO T99) with no more than 110% optimum moisture.
   (D)   For both the CLSM, operation limitations, measurement methods and
basis of payment, if applicable, shall all be in compliance with the IDOT
Special Provision for Controlled Low-Strength Material as adopted on January 1,
1990 and revised on March 1, 1990.
   (E)   When a trench is cut into an existing pavement or sidewalk, the
pavement shall be replaced in kind with a total thickness two inches greater
than existing to a maximum of ten inches. When restoring Portland Cement
concrete pavement, the entire slab into which the trench was cut shall be
removed and replaced. If the surface is either asphalt or oil and chip, a six-
inch thickness Portland Cement concrete base shall be installed and two inches
of bituminous concrete surface course shall be placed over the base.
Replacement pavement shall be installed no less than a distance of two feet in
each direction beyond the edge of the excavation trench.
   (F)   All utility structures (i.e., shut-off valves, vault boxes, lids,
poles, lines, markers and the like) that pose a threat to public safety shall
be replaced when directed by the Village Administrator or Water/Sewer
Superintendent. Failure to make the repairs within the approved time frame will
result in a penalty of $75 per day.

(Ord. 13-07-02, passed 7-23-2013)
§ 94.02 TREE COMMISSION; ESTABLISHMENT, COMPOSITION, APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS,
DUTIES.
   (A)   Establishment. There is hereby created the Village Tree Commission,
hereinafter referred to as the “Commission.”
   (B)   Composition. The Commission will consist of three residents of the
village area, appointed annually by the Village President, by and with the
advice and consent of the Board of Trustees. These three Commissioners shall
serve without pay. Two of the Commission members shall be selected from among
persons experienced in forestry, horticulture, plant physiology, landscape
architecture, ecology or similar fields. The remaining Commissioner shall be a
citizen who has demonstrated an active interest in trees and/or other
improvements related to the community environment.
   (C)   Duties.
      (1)   Once a year, by the end of April, the Commission shall submit to
the Board of Trustees any plan it may have for planting and maintaining
publicly acquired trees for the following planting season. Plans submitted will
be for spring and fall planting. At the same time, the Commission shall give an
annual performance report on previously executed plans.
      (2)   The Commission shall advise the Public Works Director, who will
then be responsible for applying for any and all forms of assistance in
acquiring trees and maintenance of the existing street trees. The Commission
shall supervise the planting, maintenance, care and protection of all trees
planted in accordance with any plan approved by the Board of Trustees.
      (3)   The Public Works Department and the Village Building Inspector are
hereby made available to provide manpower, inspections, vehicles and equipment
as necessary to deliver, plant, inspect and maintain the trees under the
Commission’s supervision as allowed with the current budget.
(Ord. 13-07-02, passed 7-23-2013)
§ 94.03 PERMITS.
   (A)   Scope of requirement. No person(s) except the Commission, the Public
Works Department or designee may perform any of the following acts without
first obtaining from the village a permit, for which no fee shall be charged.
All acts must follow International Society of Arboriculture’s best management
practices.
      (1)   Plant on village-owned property, or treat, prune, remove or
otherwise disturb any tree or shrub located on village-owned property, except
that this provision shall not be construed to prohibit owners of property
adjacent to or attached to village-owned property from watering or fertilizing
without a permit any tree, shrub or other plant located on village-owned
property;
      (2)   Trim, prune or remove any tree or portions thereof if the tree or
portions thereof reasonably may be expected to fall on village-owned property
and thereby to cause damage to persons or property;
      (3)   Place on village-owned property, either above or below ground
level, a container for trees or shrubs;
      (4)   Damage, cut, tap, carve or transplant any tree or shrub located on
village-owned property; or
      (5)   Attach any rope, wire, nail, sign, poster or any other human-made
object to any tree or shrub located on village-owned property.
   (B)   Issuance. Within seven days of receipt of the application, the village
shall issue a permit to perform within 30 days of the day of issuance any of
the acts specified in division (A) above, for which a permit is requested
whenever:
      (1)   The acts would result in the abatement of a public nuisance;
      (2)   The acts are not inconsistent with the development and
implementation of the general plan for optimizing the tree and shrub resources
of the village;
      (3)   An application has been signed by the applicant and submitted to
the Village Office detailing the location, number, size and species of trees or
shrubs that will be affected by the acts, setting forth the purpose of the acts
and the methods to be used, and presenting any additional information that the
Commission may find reasonably necessary to a determination of whether the acts
are consistent with this chapter;
      (4)   The applicant agrees to perform the work for which the permit is
sought in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and with the
regulations and standards set forth by the Commission;
      (5)   The applicant certifies that he or she has read and understands
those provisions of this chapter which are pertinent to the work for which the
permit is sought;
      (6)   The applicant has made himself or herself familiar with Table I set
forth in Appendix A to this chapter, which contains a list of tree species or
the varieties acceptable and approved for planting on village property, with
approval of the Tree Commission;
      (7)   The applicant has made certain that the tree(s) or plants for which
he or she has secured an application are not of the unacceptable tree species
or their varieties contained in Table II, set forth in Appendix A to this
chapter, which shall not be planted on village property; and
      (8)   If the work for which a permit is issued entails the felling of any
tree or part thereof, located on private property, which, as a result of the
felling reasonably may be expected to fall upon village-owned property, and if
the felling is done by one other than the owner of the property on which the
felling is done, then the applicant shall agree to indemnify and to hold the
village harmless for all damages resulting from work conducted pursuant to the
permit, and shall deposit with the Village Clerk a liability insurance policy
in the amount of $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident for bodily injury
liability and $50,000 aggregate for property damage liability, which policy
shall name the village as an additional insured.
   (C)   Maintenance. Watering, fertilization, insect control and pruning are
the responsibility of the Public Works Department or designee. Maintenance is
described as follows:
      (1)   Watering. Ample soil moisture shall be maintained following
planting. A thorough watering once in five to ten days, depending on soil type
and drainage provisions, is usually adequate during the growing season. A soil
auger can be used to check the adequacy of moisture in the soil ball and/or
backfill;
      (2)   Pruning. Pruning shall follow ISA or equivalent pruning standards.
Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead, broken or injured
branches; the suppression of rank, uneven growth that affects form. Water
sprouts shall be removed when they reach the diameter of a pencil. Pruning
shall be practiced as often thereafter as needed to assure sturdy crotch
development. Occasionally a tree will develop double leaders known as co-
dominant stems. These can lead to structural weaknesses, so it is best to
remove one. Any tree or shrub which overhangs any sidewalk, street or other
public place in the village in such a way as to impede or interfere with
traffic or travel on the public place shall be trimmed by the owner of the
premises on which the trees or shrubs grow so that the obstruction shall cease.
Tree crowns should be elevated as growth characteristics and location dictate.
Newly planted trees need not have lower branches removed until they are well
established;
      (3)   Excavations. In making excavations in street or other public
places, proper care shall be taken to avoid injury to the roots of any tree or
shrub, wherever possible.
      (4)   Tree topping. It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any
person, firm or village department to top any street tree, park tree or other
tree on public property. TOPPING is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs
to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a
degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely
damaged by storms or other causes, or certain other causes or certain trees
under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are
impractical may be exempted from this section at the determination of the Tree
Commission.
      (5)   Removal of stumps. All stumps of street and park trees shall be
removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not
project above the surface of the ground.
   (D)   Public utility companies. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to exempt public utility companies or their agents from any of the requirements
of this chapter.
   (E)   Visibility. Please refer to current zoning regulations for details.
(Ord. 13-07-02, passed 7-23-2013)
§ 94.04 PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   (A)   Public nuisances. The following are hereby declared PUBLIC NUISANCES
under this chapter:
      (1)   Any dead or dying tree or shrub, whether located on village-owned
property or on private property;
      (2)   Any otherwise healthy tree or shrub, whether located on village-
owned property or private property, which harbors insects or diseases which
reasonably may be expected to cause injury or substantial harm to any tree or
shrub;
      (3)   Any tree, shrub, or portion thereof, whether located on village-
owned property or on private property, which by reason of location or condition
constitutes an imminent danger to the health, safety or welfare of the general
public;
      (4)   Any tree, shrub or portion thereof, whether located on village-
owned property or on private property, which obstructs the free passage of
pedestrian or vehicular traffic or which obstructs a street light or traffic
control sign; or
      (5)   Any tree, shrub or portion thereof, whether located on village-
owned property or on private property, which dangerously obstructs the view in
the visibility triangle (refer to current zoning regulations for details).
   (B)   Prohibited acts. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter
for any person to do any of the following:
      (1)   Deposit, store or maintain on village-owned property any stone,
brick, sand, concrete, lumber, tile, pipe, other materials or vehicles that
will over time compact the soil causing an impediment to the free passage of
water, air and nutrients to the roots of any tree or shrub;
      (2)   Cause any gaseous, liquid or solid substance which, because of the
nature or amount, reasonably may be expected to be toxic or otherwise harmful
to trees, shrubs or other plants, to be located where the substance reasonably
may be expected to affect trees or shrubs located on village-owned property.
   (C)   Abatement. The following are the prescribed means of abating public
nuisances under this chapter.
      (1)   Any public nuisance under this chapter which is located on village-
owned property shall be pruned, removed or otherwise treated by the Public
Works Department or designee in whatever fashion is required to cause the
abatement of the nuisance within a reasonable time after its discovery.
      (2)   Any public nuisance under this chapter which is located on private
property shall be pruned, removed or otherwise treated by the property owner or
his or her agent in whatever fashion is required to cause the abatement of the
nuisance. No property owner may be found guilty of violating this provision
unless and until the following requirements of notice have been satisfied:
         (a)   The Commission shall direct the Public Works Department to send
a written notice to be sent by registered or certified mail to the owner of the
property upon which the nuisance is found;
         (b)   The notice shall describe with particularity the tree or shrub
which has been declared to be a public nuisance;
         (c)   The notice shall state with particularity the alternative
actions that the property owner may undertake to abate the nuisance;
         (d)   The notice will require the elimination of the nuisance within
30 days after receipt of the notice by the property owner; unless a more
appropriate timeframe is otherwise established by the village and agreed to by
both parties;
         (e)   The notice shall set forth the procedures by which the property
owner may be heard by the Tree Commission to protest the requirements that he
or she act to abate the nuisance; and
         (f)   If the property owner cannot be located following diligent
inquiry by the Commission, the notice shall be served upon the occupant or
person in charge of the property upon which the nuisance is located. In the
event that the nuisance is not abated within 30 days following receipt of
notice by the property owner, the Commission is authorized to cause the
abatement of the nuisance, and the reasonable cost of the abatement shall be
filed as a lien against the property on which the nuisance was located, and the
property owner of the property upon which the nuisance is located shall be
subject to prosecution under §
94.99. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to exempt any person from
the requirements of obtaining permits under §
94.03.
      (3)   The provisions of divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section
notwithstanding, the Commission is hereby empowered to cause the immediate
abatement of any public nuisance under this chapter, provided that the nuisance
is declared by the Commission to threaten imminent and serious danger of injury
or death to any person, and provided that the owner of the property on which
the nuisance is located cannot be found through the diligent efforts of the
Commission.
      (4)   The Commission is hereby empowered to seek from any court of
competent jurisdiction an order directing the immediate abatement of any public
nuisance under this chapter.

(Ord. 13-07-02, passed 7-23-2013) Penalty, see §
94.99
§ 94.06 LIEN.
   (A)   The cost of any work performed by or on behalf of the village pursuant
to a property owner’s failure to comply with this chapter shall be a lien upon
the owner’s real estate. Whenever a bill for the work remains unpaid 30 days
after it has been rendered to the property owner, the Village Clerk shall file
within 60 days after the cost and expense of the work is incurred with the
Recorder of Deeds of the county, a notice of lien. The notice shall consist of
a sworn statement setting out:
      (1)   A description of the real estate sufficient for identification
thereof;
      (2)   The amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred or
payable for the work; and
      (3)   The date or dates when the cost and expense were incurred by the
village.
   (B)   A copy of the notice shall be mailed by the Village Administrator or
his or her designee to the owner of the premises at his or her last known
address, if his or her address is known, otherwise to the owner at the address
of the premises.
   (C)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid bills shall be sold for
nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay
the charges, after deducting costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, as in
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. The Village Attorney is hereby
authorized to institute the proceedings in the name of the village, in any
court having jurisdiction over the matter, within two years from the date the
costs and expense were incurred.
(Ord. 13-07-02, passed 7-23-2013)

§ 94.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or who fails to comply
with any notice issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, upon being
found guilty of violation, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor
more than $200 for each separate offense. Each day during which any violation
of the provisions of this chapter shall occur or continue shall be considered a
separate offense, and is subject to a fine. If, as the result of the violation
of any provision of this chapter, the injury, mutilation or death of a tree or
shrub located on village-owned property is caused, the cost of repair or
replacement of the tree or shrub shall be borne by the party in violation.
Replacement trees may be required; the size and number determined by the
Commission. All requests are reviewed by the Commission.

   Medium sized trees are better suited for planting on normal village parkways
than their larger counterparts. Large trees require more living space, and for
this reason it is recommended that they be planted on the private side of the
sidewalk whenever possible. The overall objective of proper tree selection is
to select the right tree for the right location in order that one may benefit
from the tree without being subject to future maintenance liabilities or
hazards.
   (C)   Small trees.

   Small trees are appropriate in parkway locations where, due to space
limitations, larger trees cannot be properly utilized without creating
conflicts with existing trees. Height limitations imposed by overhead utilities
also necessitate the use of appropriate small trees to avoid line conflicts and
the necessity of excessive utility trimming that results in disfigured trees.
On the whole, small trees which tend to be more ornamental than their larger
counterparts can create an added aesthetic dimension to the streetscape.

TABLE II: TREES NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR PLANTING.
   (A)   The following is a listing of trees more or less common to the area
that are not suitable as street or parkway trees. Their lack of suitability is
based on undesirable growth habits, fruiting habits, form, susceptibility to
serious diseases, propensity to storm damage, and a host of other limitations
too numerous to mention. The limitations listed for each tree or species group
are not all-inclusive, and lists only the more serious problems encountered
locally. In essence, there are far too many superior street or parkway trees
listed in Table I to warrant the use of any of the trees listed in Table II
except under special circumstances.
   (B)   Though many of the trees listed in Table II are presently growing on
our parkways as the result of previously unrestricted plantings, they do
constitute a maintenance liability to the village and as such, upon removal,
should be replaced with species listed in Table I.

   (K)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The provider shall comply with
applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning
the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the
requirements include a waiver, variance, exception or other process that
addresses provider requests for exception, waiver or variance and do not
prohibit the granting of such exceptions, waivers or variances.
   (L)   Undergrounding regulations. A provider shall comply with local code
provisions or regulations concerning requirements that require the underground
placement of utility cables and/or prohibit the installation of new or the

§ 116.01 PURPOSE; FINDINGS AND RATIONALE.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens of the village, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the village. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.

Daytona Beach, Florida-2003; Various Media Articles; and "Rural Hotspots: The
Case of Adult Businesses," 19 Criminal Justice Policy Review 153 (2008); the
Village Board of Trustees finds:
         (a)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses,
are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but
not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and
lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
         (b)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm which the village has a substantial government interest in preventing and/
or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary
effects, which is the village's rationale for this chapter, exists independent
of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, the village's interest in regulating sexually
oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either
current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the village.
The village finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter
are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (C)   The village hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings
and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to
such secondary effects.
   (D)   The village notes that the City of Metropolis, Illinois passed a
similar ordinance, which ordinance was upheld as constitutional by the Federal
District Court of the Southern District of Illinois in the case of Metro Pony
LLC v. Metropolis IL, Case No. 2011 CV 144 (S.D.111. 2011) and this chapter is
modeled after and substantially the same as the Metropolis ordinance.

act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of
that employee's license shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business

of license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if an officer, director, or
general partner, or a person who managed, supervised, or controlled the
operation of the business premises, knowingly or recklessly allowed such act to
occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability that the person to
whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

owner of record is informed of his right to a hearing and signs a written
waiver, in which case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made
when the village receives the written waiver.

treasurer, the impounded motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record
upon the payment of any applicable towing and storage fees to the towing agent.
If an administrative fee is imposed for any violation, the cash bond will be
forfeited to the village; however, in the event a violation is not proven by a
preponderance of the evidence, the cash bond will be returned to the person
posting the bond. All bond money to be forfeited to the village pursuant to
this section shall be held by the village treasurer until 35 days after an
administrative fee is imposed by the hearing officer under this section, or, if
there is a judicial review, until a final judgment is rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

   If the administrative fee and applicable towing and storage fees are not
paid within 35 days after an administrative fee is imposed under this chapter
against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the vehicle
impoundment hearing, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed
vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and applicable towing
and storage fees are not paid within 35 days after the expiration of time at
which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be
sought, or within 35 days after an action seeking administrative review has
been resolved in favor of the village, whichever is applicable, the motor
vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles; provided that, if
the motor vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to state or federal drug
asset forfeiture laws and proceedings have been instituted under state or
federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the motor vehicle may not be disposed of by
the village except as consistent with those proceedings.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. The term does
not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of

variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
      (1)   No variations shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
floodplain;
         (b)   A significant hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
         (c)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
         (d)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety,
or creation of a nuisance;
         (e)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities or other
public facilities;
         (f)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique or unusual and do not
establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
         (g)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
      (2)   The Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of §
151.26 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
         (a)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage;
         (b)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
         (c)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
      (3)   Historic structures. Variances to the building protection
requirements of §
151.26 which are requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in §
151.02 of this code may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of §§
151.26 and
151.27, subject to the conditions that:
         (a)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and
         (b)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
      (4)   Agriculture. Any variance granted for an agricultural structure
shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the
building’s unique circumstances. In order to minimize flood damages during the
100 year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following
conditions shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural
structures that are constructed at grade and wet floodproofed:
         (a)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate
location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the agricultural
structure. Residential structures such as farm houses cannot be considered
agricultural structures;
         (b)   Use of the structures must be limited to agricultural purposes;
         (c)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures,
the exterior and the interior building components and elements (i.e.,
foundation, wall framing, exterior and finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base
flood elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance
with §
151.26 of this code;
         (d)   Agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with §
151.26. All of the building’s structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces;
         (e)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with §
151.26;
         (f)   The NFIP requires that enclosures or foundation walls, subject
to the 100 year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry
and exit of floodwaters in accordance with §
151.26(B);
         (g)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of §
151.25. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any
designated floodway; and
         (h)   Wet floodproofing techniques must be viewed and approved by the
Village Administrator and a licensed professional engineer or architect prior
to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.
      (5)   Upon application for a variance, a public hearing shall be held by
the Village Board of Appeals. No less than 15 days’ and no more than 30 days’
notice shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The
Plan and Zoning Commission shall review the request for a variance, and shall
submit its advisory opinion on the application. The Board of Appeals shall fix
a reasonable time for the hearing of the variance request. Every decision of
the Board of Appeals shall be by resolution, each of which shall contain a full
record of the findings of the Board in a particular case. Each resolution shall
be filed with the Village Clerk.
(Ord. 13-09-1, passed 9-10-2013)
§ 151.31 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village, or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 13-09-1, passed 9-10-2013)
§ 151.32 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the village to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including Ord.
87-3-1 and Ord. 02-12-03. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements,
covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 13-09-1, passed 9-10-2013)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or
failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Upon due investigation, the Village Administrator may determine that a
violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The Village
Administrator shall notify the property owner in writing of such violation.
      (1)   If such owner fails after ten days of notice to correct the
violation:
         (a)   The Village Administrator may make application to the circuit
court for an injunction
requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court
deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter.
         (b)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not less than $50 nor more than $500 for each offense; and
         (c)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day
during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
         (d)   The Village Administrator may record a notice of violation on
the title to the property.
         (e)   The Village Administrator may implement proceedings to revoke
any site development permit, zoning use permit, or building permit for the
site.
      (2)   The Village Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
      (4)   The Village Administrator is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of any development in violation of this chapter. The stop work
order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall
order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop
work order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the floodplain
development permit.
      (5)   No site development permit, zoning use permit, or building permit
shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Board
of Appeals.
         (a)   Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee
and shall state the following:
            1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
            2.   The time and place of the hearing.
         (b)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his or her behalf.
      (c)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Appeals shall
determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.

§ 152.049 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Specific area, height and yard regulations for certain public and
quasi-public utility uses, including public utility substations and
communications towers, may be established by the Village Plan and Zoning
Commission and Board of Trustees on a case-by-case basis through the

   (B)   These regulations shall supersede those in §
152.090.
   (C)   These regulations shall be set forth with consideration of
circumstances unique to the utility uses, including the following.
      (1)   Required lot areas may be minimal due to the typically small size
of utility substation buildings and equipment enclosures. A lot size of 4,000
square feet is a suggested minimum.
      (2)   Required lot widths may also be minimal due to the small size of
buildings and enclosures. A lot width of 40 feet is a suggested minimum.
      (3)   Lot frontage on a public street may not be necessary since utility
substations and communications towers are generally only visited for routine
maintenance purposes. In those cases, access may be provided by easement across
adjacent lands.
      (4)   In cases where a lot is replatted for utility use, yard setbacks
may be measured from the exterior lot lines of the larger lot. Setbacks may be
reduced so long as minimum setbacks along public streets are maintained,
visibility along all roadways is maintained, and minimum side yard separation
is maintained from other existing or potential structures. Setback requirements
may be increased for yards adjacent to residential zoning or uses.
      (5)   Heights for communications towers may be allowable up to 200 feet,
so long as associated distances from residentially zoned or used properties are
maintained, and appropriate permits from federal and state agencies are
obtained.
      (6)   Site fencing may be required.
      (7)   Site landscaping and buffering from adjacent uses may be required.
      (8)   Minimum distances from residentially zoned or used properties may

installation of fencing.
      (1)   Fences, hedges or walls not more than four feet in height may
project into or enclose any front yard between the right-of-way line and the
established front yard setback line. Corner lots are considered to have two
front yards for the purposes of these fencing regulations. Fences that project
into or enclose any front yard must not be more than 50% opaque.

      (1)   Changed to another nonconforming sign;
      (2)   Structurally altered as to prolong the life of the sign;
      (3)   Expanded;
      (4)   Subsequently re-established or replaced after its having been

time of the damage or destruction;
      (6)   Routinely maintained where the cost of the repair or maintenance is

nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any sign or part thereof declared to be unsafe
by any official charged with protecting the public safety; or
      (7)   Relocated, unless relocation brings the sign into conformance with
all the requirements of this chapter, except that where a nonconforming sign is
located within a right-of-way taken or acquired by a public body for street
improvement purposes, then the relocation of such a sign is permitted.
   (C)   All permanent nonconforming signs shall be removed or brought into
conformity with this chapter by January 1, 2009 (approximately ten years of the

temporary or portable signs shall be removed within 30 days of adoption of this
chapter.
   (D)   The Zoning Board of Appeals after receiving the recommendation of the
Plan and Zoning Commission shall have the power to grant a variance from the
provisions of division (B) above, so as to permit change, alteration, re-
establishment or more than routine maintenance of a nonconforming sign, where
the change, alteration, re-establishment or maintenance shall not increase the
size of the sign, make it radiate or reflect more light, or otherwise make it
visually more objectionable. No variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall in any way postpone the time for removal of the nonconforming sign as
provided in division (C) above beyond the time when the original sign, which
was permitted to be changed, altered, reestablished or maintained hereunder,
would have been required to be removed.

administrating official, forthwith in the case of immediate danger and in any
case within not more than ten days, make the sign safe, eliminate the dangerous
condition or remove it. If the owner does not improve or remove the sign, then
the village reserves the right to do so and to seek reimbursement from the
owner for related expenses.
   (B)   An abandoned sign, including any support pole, mounting base, mounting
brackets and the like, must be removed by the owner of the property upon which
the sign is located. If the owner does not remove the sign, then the village
reserves the right to do so and to seek reimbursement from the owner for
related expenses.
   (C)   The owner of any sign shall ensure that the sign be kept in good
repair and shall provide that the sign is properly painted or otherwise cleaned
and washed, and that all parts and all supports of the sign be cleaned or
painted, unless the same are galvanized or treated to prevent rust.

within 500 feet of the right-of-way of the highway; and more than 500 feet from
any residential district, school, park, hospital, nursing home or other OAS,
then the sign may be erected to a height as to be visible from a distance of 1/
2-mile on the highway or a maximum height of 45 feet, whichever is less, and
the sign may have an area not greater than 300 square feet. These regulations
apply only to OASs facing Interstate Highway 74; they do not apply to OASs
facing Federal Aid-Primary Highways.
(11) For purposes of determining separation measurements, the following shall
apply:
a. Separation measurements between OASs shall be measured along same side of a
street.
b. Measurements from wall OASs shall be made from the closest edge or
projection of the OAS to the structure from which it is being separated.
c. Measurements from freestanding OASs shall be made from the closest ground
projection or support of the structure to the structure from which it is being
separated.
(12) Compliance with these regulations, or those contained in the Illinois

§ 152.091 AREA AND HEIGHT MODIFICATIONS.
   The height and area regulations specified in the foregoing are modified as
specified below.
   (A)   Lot area and width. Any lot of record at the time of passage of this
chapter having less area or width than herein required may be used for a
single-family dwelling. In the R-2 and R-3 Zoning Districts, any lot which was
of public record and platted on or before May 8, 1978, on which there is
proposed to be erected a single-family dwelling shall contain an area of not
less than 7,500 square feet. In the R-2 and R-3 Zoning Districts, any lot which
was of public record on or before November 10, 1986 upon which there is
proposed to be erected a single-family, two-family or multiple-family dwelling
shall have a lot width of not less than 65 feet. Minimum lot widths are as
established in the table of area, height and yard regulations in §
152.090. For regularly shaped lots, the lot width shall mean the average
distance between the side lot lines, measured at right angles to the depth of
the lot along the lot frontage. For irregularly shaped or wedge-shaped lots,
the lot width shall be the arc at the points of intersection of the front
setback line with the side lot lines. For irregular shaped or wedge-shaped lots
only, such as along a cul-de-sac, the front yard setback line may be adjusted
to increase the front yard setback through the subdivision plat review process
to meet the minimum lot width requirement, but in no case shall the lot
frontage at the front lot line be less than 40 feet. The minimum lot area
requirements shall be reduced to 5,000 square feet for any lot of record within
a commercial or industrial district and existing on or before January 1, 2002
and which is proposed to be utilized for a permissive or conditional use
consistent with that district as set forth in division (B) below.
   (B)   Front yard. Where 30% or more of a block front is improved with
buildings, then no part of any new building shall project beyond a line joining
the two adjacent corners of the buildings on either side thereof, or where
there is a building on only one side, beyond a line projected from the
corresponding adjacent corner of the building except that no building shall be
required to provide a front yard greater than 50 feet in any event. Where an
official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a
street upon which a lot abuts, then the depth of a front or side yard shall be
measured from the official line.
   (C)   Side yard. The required side yard shall be maintained on each side of
a dwelling, but the side yard may be reduced to 10% of the lot width on lots of
less than 65 feet in width, provided, however, that no side yard shall be less
than five feet.
      (1)   The required side yard on the street side of a corner lot shall be
the same as the required front yard on the street, except that the building
width shall not be reduced to less than 32 feet, and no accessory building
shall project beyond the required front yard on either street.
      (2)   For the purpose of side yard regulations, a two-family dwelling,
group house or multiple dwelling shall be considered as one building occupying
one lot.
   (D)   Rear yard. The required rear yard may be reduced to 20% of the depth
of the lot on any lot not exceeding 125 feet in depth. An accessory building,
including guest quarters, may be built within a required rear yard when located
at least five feet from the rear lot line and when occupying not more than 30%
of the area of the required rear yard. Accessory, open and uncovered swimming
pools, home barbecue grills and home incinerators may occupy a required rear
yard, provided they are not located closer than five feet to the rear lot line
nor closer than two feet to a side lot line.
   (E)   All yards. The ordinary projection of roof over-hangs, cornices and
ornamental features may be permitted but the projections shall not exceed 48
inches into any required yard.
      (1)   Filling station pumps and pump islands may occupy the required
yard, provided, however that they are not less than 15 feet from street lines.
      (2)   One directional or name sign or sign advertising products sold on
the premises may occupy required yards in a district where the sign is
permitted by the use regulations of this chapter, provided the sign is of not
more than 25 square feet in area.
      (3)   Fences, hedges or walls. See §
152.050(D).
      (4)   Where a lot or tract is used for multiple-family, commercial or
industrial purposes, more than one main building may be located on the lot or
tract, but only when the buildings conform to all open space requirements
around the lot for the district in which the lot or tract is located.
      (5)   Required front yards shall be devoted entirely to landscaped area
except for guest parking and the necessary paving of driveways and sidewalks to
reach parking or loading areas in the side or rear yard.
      (6)   Where an official line has been established for the future widening
or opening of a street or major thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, then the
depth of a front or side yard shall be measured from the official line to the
nearest line of the building.
      (7)   Trailers, including camping and boat trailers, pick-up camper
bodies, and boats shall be stored only in established rear yards.
   (F)   Height.
      (1)   Chimneys, cooling or water towers, elevators, bulkheads, fire
towers, monuments, stacks, stage towers or necessary mechanical apparatuses may
be erected to any height not in conflict with any other ordinance of the
village.
      (2)   Public, semi-public or public service buildings, hospitals,
institutions, churches and schools, when permitted in a district may be erected
to exceed height limits specified for the district, provided all required yards
are increased by one foot for each foot of building height above the specified
height limit.
      (3)   Buildings in the R-3, C and I Districts may be increased in height
one foot for each foot the building is set back from all yard lines up to a
maximum height of 100 feet, provided that the gross floor area provided
exclusive of enclosed garages, does not exceed the number of square feet of
land area of the lot on which the building is placed.
   (G)   Row house building.
      (1)   In districts where row house buildings are permitted and row houses
are to be constructed for sale, each on its own lot, to individual owners, the
row houses shall not be subject to the minimum lot requirements of §
152.090 but instead shall be subject to the minimum requirements specified in
this section.
      (2)   Minimum lot area for a row house lot shall be not less than 5,000
square feet.
      (3)   Minimum frontage of a row house lot on a public street shall be not
less than 30 feet on a standard lot and not less than 50 feet on a corner lot.
      (4)   (a)   No side yard shall be required along any side lot line which
is common to two attached row houses, whether they be on interior or exterior
row house lots.
         (b)   On side yard, conforming to the least width required by §
152.090 shall be required along the side lot lines of an exterior row house lot
where the lot line is not common to that of any other attached row house.
      (5)   Front yard and rear yard requirements as established in §
152.090 shall be provided for all row house dwellings.
      (6)   A minimum lot width of 40 feet shall be provided for all interior
and exterior row house lots.
      (7)   Row houses shall be developed on subdivided lots with no more than
three units per building; nor shall the building exceed 120 feet in length.
      (8)   The maximum lot coverage for row house lot shall be 40% and not
less than 1,800 square feet of open space shall be provided on each row house
lot.
      (9)   Exterior treatment of attached row houses shall be integrated.
Exterior of buildings shall be maintained in their original color and treatment
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the affected lot owners.
      (10)   (a)   An unobstructed easement shall be provided across the side
and rear eight feet of each exterior row house lot (triplex), when adjacent to
an interior row house lot, for ingress and egress of adjacent interior row
house lot owners for maintenance purposes.
         (b)   The access easement shall be unobstructed and physically
passable at all times. This easement shall be incorporated into each deed
transferring title to the property.
      (11)   A party wall agreement shall be included in the subdivision
covenants for each row house lot setting forth provisions for repair of common
walls, repair of common utility service connections, reconstruction of the
common building in the event of damage or destruction of one or all of the
dwelling units and common maintenance and repair of joint facilities.
      (12)   The coincident property walls (party wall) of each row house shall
be constructed in a manner which complies with the standards for common walls
established by the BOCA Building Code of 1990, in that each common wall shall
have a minimum fire resistance rating of two hours.

agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
   (D)   Severability. If any part or provision of these regulations or the
application of these regulations to any person or circumstances is judged
invalid by an court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment shall be confined
in its operation to the part, provision or application directly involved in the
controversy in which the judgment shall be rendered, and it shall not affect or
impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations.
(Ord. 15-12-01, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.006 SUBDIVISION REQUIRED.
   (A)   Subdivision required when land divided. Whenever land is divided

extraterritorial jurisdiction boundary of the village, these regulations apply
for that land, unless another municipality has subdivision approval authority
pursuant to a boundary agreement with the village.
   (B)   Conveyance of large sections prior to development. A single tract of
at least ten acres may be conveyed from a parent parcel of 30 acres or more
without approval of a preliminary or final plat, provided that an area general
plan is approved for the parent tract by the Plan and Zoning Commission and
that the single tract so created is intended for further subdivision as a part
of the overall development plan for the parent tract. Under these circumstances
no further development shall be permitted upon the conveyed tract until it has
complied with the regulations set forth in this chapter.
   (C)   Activity prohibited prior to subdivision approval.

request that Champaign County refuse to issue a building permit or zoning use
permit for any parcel, tract, or lot that is in violation of these regulations.
(Ord. 15-12-01, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.007 SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically
unsuitable should not be subdivided for residential purposes, nor for such
other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property, or aggravate
erosion or flood hazards. The village belongs to the Federal Flood Insurance
Program and has a map indicating flood prone areas. This map may be obtained
from the Village Clerk.
   (B)   The Village Plan and Zoning Commission shall not approve the
subdivision of land if upon adequate investigation conducted by the Commission
it has been determined by the Commission that in the best interest of the
public the site is not suitable for the subdivision and development of the kind
proposed. In making this evaluation the Village Plan and Zoning Commission
shall make reference to the applicable portions of the Village Comprehensive
Plan, the Village Zoning Ordinance, the Champaign County Zoning Ordinance, the
Champaign County Comprehensive Plan, and other general standards of the
community. The Village Plan and Zoning Commission may further make reference to
investigations of soil suitability or effects on sensitive habitats, the

COMMISSION OF THE VILLAGE OF MAHOMET, ILLINOIS THIS  __  DAY OF
                            , 20          .
                                                         
CHAIRPERSON
   (I)   The approval of the area general plan by the Plan and Zoning
Commission of the village shall be in effect for a period of at least five
years from the approval date, but the approval is subject thereafter to
withdrawal by the Village Plan and Zoning Commission upon notice to the
developer after that date.
   (J)   The approval of the area general plan shall confer upon the developer
the right to proceed with the subdivision platting process set forth in this
chapter for the lands depicted on the area general plan.
(Ord. 15-12-01, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.036 PRELIMINARY PLAT PHASE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary plat phase, insofar as
possible, is to assist the subdivider and the reviewing authorities in
determining whether the proposed subdivision conforms to the standards and
requirements of these regulations and the approved area general plan, and the
pertinent standards and regulations of affected municipal departments. The
preliminary plat phase is intended to establish lot design for the subdivision,
establish utility layout and street and intersection design, and identify
waivers from the subdivision regulations. The preliminary plat phase helps
assure that the final plat design is consistent with the overall plan for the
area. Outside agency review is included at this stage, so that utility and
street issues are addressed early in the development process, and the
subdivider can be assured that factors affecting approval of the final plat
have been considered prior to the final design of the public improvements.
Preliminary plat approval by the Village Board of Trustees shall not qualify
the plat for recording.
   (B)   A preliminary plat shall be required for all subdivisions except as
outlined below. The requirement for a preliminary plat shall not apply under
the following conditions:
      (1)   Where any tract of land within the village limits is to be divided
into less than ten lots of less than five acres each.
      (2)   Where any tract of land within the village limits is the entire
parcel owned by the subdivider and the tract is a portion of an approved area
general plan.
      (3)   Where any tract of land is subdivided under the terms and
requirements of the agricultural subdivision process.
      (4)   where any tract of land is subdivided under the terms and
requirements of the rural residential subdivision process.
      (5)   where any tract of land is subdivided under the terms and
requirements of the minor subdivision process.
      (6)   where any tract of land is subdivided under the terms and
requirements of the certificate of exemption process.
   (C)   When a preliminary plat is not required, no further subdivision of
adjacent land owned by the same beneficial interests shall be considered for
subdivision within five years without full compliance with the requirements for
a preliminary plat.
   (D)   When a preliminary plat is not required, the subdivider may proceed
directly with preparation and submission of a final plat, construction plans,
and other subsidiary documents.

subdivision shall be experienced in site/civil infrastructure construction and
shall have not less than 12 months of prior experience as a construction
observer. The qualifications and resume of the construction observer assigned
to the particular subdivision shall be provided to the village not less than
ten business days before the start of any on-site construction activities.
Village staff shall review the qualifications of the proposed resident
observer. If village staff determines that the proposed resident observer is
not qualified or not performing, the village shall notify the subdivider and
the subdivider’s engineer that construction activities may not take place until
a qualified resident observer has been assigned to the subdivision.
      (2)   In the event that the resident observer assigned to a subdivision
must be replaced, the replacement individual shall also be pre-qualified in a
like manner before any replacement occurs. Short substitutions of less than one
week due to illness or other similar disruption shall not require
prequalification of the substitute resident observer.
      (3)   Construction work performed without the physical presence on-site
of the assigned resident observer may be rejected by the village as
unsatisfactory.

§ 154.044 TIME PERIOD FOR CONSTRUCTION.
   The subdivider shall complete construction of all subdivision improvements
within two years of the date the village approves the construction plans and
specifications for the subdivision. At the subdivider’s request, the Village
Planner may extend the time period in which to complete the construction for an
additional one year if the Village Planner finds that such an extension is
consistent with the public welfare.
(Ord. 15-12-01, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.045 APPROVAL OF CONSTRUCTED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The developer’s engineer shall conduct a “punch list” inspection of
the constructed improvements, and shall identify any incomplete work or
deficiencies in the construction work. The “punch list” inspection shall be
attended by the Village Engineer. A copy of the “punch list” which identifies
incomplete, deficient, or defective work shall be prepared by the developer’s
engineer and provided to the village. Upon completion of the construction work
needed to address and correct “punch list” items, the developer’s engineer
shall notify the Village Engineer and Village Planner that the improvements are
substantially complete, and ready for semi-final inspection by the village. The
notification shall be accompanied by the original “punch list” amended to
denote corrective actions taken, pre-final “record” drawings which depict the
constructed improvements, and by any other testing results and documents
required to verify compliance with chapter requirements during construction.
   (B)   Within a reasonable time frame of receipt of the pre-final record
drawings and the notification of substantial completion, the Village Engineer
shall conduct a semi-final inspection of the constructed improvements. The
developer’s engineer shall attend the semi-final inspection. At that time, the
Village Engineer will identify any additional defects, deficiencies, or
incomplete work. The developer shall correct the additional defects,
deficiencies, or incomplete work identified within a reasonable time
thereafter. Upon notification that all corrective work is complete, the Village
Engineer shall make a final inspection of the constructed improvements and
confirm that all previously identified defects, deficiencies, or incomplete
work has been properly corrected.
   (C)   Before the completed improvements are approved or accepted by the
village, the subdivider’s engineer shall furnish the village a completion
certificate stating that the improvements comply with all the requirements of
the approved construction plans and specifications and are free from all
defects or deficiencies. The form of the engineer’s certificate shall be as set
forth in administrative rules.
   (D)   For purposes of this chapter, a defect in a constructed infrastructure
improvement shall include a failure to properly test and/or document testing of
the constructed improvements. A defect shall also be considered construction of
an infrastructure improvement without on-site presence of a village approved,
qualified resident observer.
   (E)   The engineer who will certify the construction of the improvements
shall not have an ownership interest in the subdivision nor be a regular
employee of the subdivider.
   (F)   Before the completed improvements are approved or accepted by the
village, the subdivider shall furnish the village with documentation certifying
that all contractors, subcontractors, and material suppliers have been paid in
full. The form of the documentation shall be as approved by the Village
Engineer.
   (G)   In the event that the semi-final inspection identifies a significant
number (i.e, more than 20 items or more than 20% of the original punch list
items, whichever is greater) of additional defects, deficiencies, or incomplete
work items, the semi-final inspection shall be repeated to verify completion of
the corrective construction activities. In the event that a second semi-final
inspection is required, the Village Clerk shall bill the subdivider for the
village’s cost for the second inspection and any subsequent inspections
necessitated by the subdivider’s failure to construction improvements in
accordance with approved construction plans and specifications in this chapter.
These costs shall be based on the actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
village including staff hourly rates and any consultant fees. The subdivider’s
performance bond and surety shall not be released until the village has been
reimbursed for these costs.
   (H)   After completion of the project and prior to acceptance by the Village
Board of Trustees, the subdivider’s engineer shall furnish the village four
complete full size sets and one half size set of “as-built” plans with each
sheet clearly marked “as-built” and dated in the lower right hand corner. These
plans shall indicate the final locations of all improvements. In addition, an
electronic copy of the “as-built” plans shall be submitted in a format as set
forth in administrative rules.
   (I)   The “as-built” plans shall contain record data concerning the
construction of all public and quasi-public facilities. “As-built” rim
elevations, invert elevations, and gradients shall be provided for all sewers
and drains. The location and invert elevation of all sanitary sewer service
lines shall be provided. Valve boxes shall be located. Operation and
maintenance manuals shall be provided for lift stations or other equipment.
Pavement elevations and gradients shall be shown. Ground surface elevations
along swales and within lots shall be provided. The locations of the
constructed improvements shall be tied to the Illinois State Plane Coordinate
System.
   (J)   Within approximately two weeks of receipt of satisfactory “as-built”
plans, the engineer’s certificate of completion, and all supporting
documentation, the Village Engineer shall submit a recommendation to the
Village Board of Trustees concerning acceptance of the subdivision
improvements. The Board of Trustees shall review the materials and information
submitted within a reasonable time thereafter, and shall conditionally accept
or reject the completed improvements, and shall clearly state the reasons for
their actions.
      (1)   If the improvements are conditionally accepted, the amount of the
surety for the performance bond may be reduced to 20% of the value of the
improvements, and a one year warranty period shall commence.
      (2)   If the improvements are rejected, the Board of Trustees shall
indicate the reasons for the rejection.
      (3)   Use of the improvements by the public or maintenance of the
improvements by any public entity, including but not limited to the village,
the Township Road District, and the Sangamon Valley Public Water District,
shall not constitute acceptance of any or all of the required improvements.
      (4)   The performance bond and surety for improvements that are
constructed for use by another government agency (e.g., Mahomet Township Road
District and Sangamon Valley Public Water District) shall not be released
without concurrence by that agency that the improvements are suitable for their
intended use.
   (K)   Obligation to correct defects for one year. The subdivider shall
maintain all subdivision improvements free from defects for a period of one
year after the date the Village Board of Trustees issues a written notice of
acceptance of all the subdivision improvements. The owner shall promptly
correct any defect of which the owner has notice or which the village
discovers, which defect occurs prior to the release of the performance bond and
surety. The village shall notify the owner of any defects discovered by the
village which occurred during this period and the owner shall promptly remedy
the same.
   (L)   Partial acceptance. If the Village Board of Trustees accepts part but
not all of the subdivision improvements, the part accepted must be maintained
free of defects by the subdivider until the expiration of the maintenance
period for all subdivision improvements.
   (M)   Defects defined and to be repaired. “Free from defects” means that all
subdivision improvements are functioning in accordance with the purpose for
which they were designed and that the improvements have not deteriorated other
than to the extent of normal wear. Non-designed cracks in pavement or sidewalk
shall not be considered normal wear. A defect which may be required to be
repaired is any:
      (1)   Failure of a subdivision improvement to operate in conformance with
this chapter during the maintenance period; or
      (2)   The appearance of any defect in a subdivision improvement which is
discovered during an inspection of the improvement made by village staff within
a reasonable period of time after the owner’s request for the release of the
performance bond and surety or at any time prior to that inspection; or
      (3)   The failure to design and construct a subdivision improvement
required by these regulations and not previously waived, the need for which is
discovered prior to the end of the maintenance period.
   (N)   Project final out. Near the conclusion of the one year warranty period
the Village Engineer shall make such investigations as is deemed appropriate to
determine if the subdivision is free from defects. The following actions shall
then occur:
      (1)   If the subdivision is free from defects the Village Engineer shall
notify the Village Planner and the Village Attorney to release the subdivision
bond and surety to the developer.
      (2)   If any defects are identified, the Village Engineer shall notify
the subdivider of the defect and identify how the defect shall be remedied. The
subdivider shall have 45 days thereafter to remedy the defect.
      (3)   Upon remedy of the defect to the satisfaction of the Village
Engineer, the Village Administrator, the Village Planner and the Village
Attorney shall be notified that the subdivision performance bond and surety may
be released to the developer.
      (4)   If any defects are not remedied within 45 days, the village shall
begin default proceedings against the subdivider, and shall use the proceeds of
the performance bond and surety to correct said default.
   (O)   Maintenance responsibility. The owner/ developer shall be responsible
for all maintenance of all public infrastructure and associated appurtenances
until such time as all of the required subdivision improvements are inspected,
approved, dedicated and officially accepted by the village, via a Village Board
of Trustees resolution.
(Ord. 15-12-01, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.046 ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS BY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.
   (A)   When a subdivision final plat involves the dedication of street right-
of-way, sanitary sewer, water main, storm drain, or other public infrastructure
to another governmental agency a certificate of acceptance shall be provided by
that agency to the village. The form of the certificate shall be set forth in
administrative rules.
   (B)   Upon completion of construction of the required physical improvements/
public infrastructure and inspection and approval by the village an authorized
representative of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public
infrastructure constructed within a subdivision shall furnish the subdivider
and the village a copy of the completed form of acceptance of public
infrastructure as set forth in administrative rules.
(Ord. 15-12-01, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.047 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT BONDS.
   (A)   Subdivision improvement bonds required prior to recording a final
plat. The owner shall execute a performance bond in favor of the village which
guarantees that all subdivision improvements required by these regulations to
be built by owner shall be constructed and maintained as required in these
regulations. The owner shall use the performance bond form approved by the
Village Attorney and contained in these regulations. SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT is
any and all improvements required to be constructed by these regulations or
other village ordinance or as a condition of final plat approval of the
subdivision.
   (B)   The subdivider shall also provide the subdivision guarantee (surety)
as specified herein. The form of the guarantee shall be as set forth in an
administrative rule or as approved by the Village Attorney. Should the
developer fail to perform the developer’s obligation to construct and maintain
public improvements as required by this chapter, the village may liquidate any
performance security in the village’s possession and use the proceeds to
construct or maintain the improvements in whole or in part as the village in
its sole discretion deems appropriate.
   (C)   Bond amounts.
      (1)   The amount of the subdivision improvement performance bond shall be
115% of the estimated cost of construction of all subdivision improvements. The
cost estimate shall be prepared by the subdivider’s engineer and must be
approved by the Village Engineer.
      (2)   The amount of the performance guarantee (surety) shall be based on
the estimated value of the remaining improvements to be constructed at the time
of recording of the subdivision final plat, assuring the village adequate
coverage to secure the satisfactory construction, installation, payment of
contractors, and dedication of the uncompleted portions of the required
improvements. The Village Attorney shall approve the performance guarantee only
after a recommendation of approval of the amount of the guarantee is received
from the Village Engineer.
   (D)   Performance guarantee and surety. The performance guarantee (surety)
shall be in a form as set forth via Administrative Rule and as approved by the
Village Attorney. The surety shall be one of the following:
      (1)   Corporate surety bond as approved by Village Attorney.
      (2)   Certificate of deposit as approved by Village Attorney.
      (3)   Cash.
      (4)   Cashier’s check.
      (5)   Irrevocable letter of credit as approved by Village Attorney.
   (E)   Surety amounts. The amount of the performance guarantee shall be 115%
of the estimated value of the cost of the proposed public and quasi-public
improvements if construction work has not commenced. If construction of the
improvements was commenced subsequent to approval of the subdivision, but prior
to the recording of the subdivision documents, the amount of the surety shall
be as follows:
      (1)   If the improvements are 1% to 75% completed, 150% of the estimated
cost of completing the remaining improvements, but in no case shall the surety
be less than 20% of the cost of all of the public and quasi-public
improvements.
      (2)   If the improvements are more than 75% completed, 200% of the
estimated cost of completing the remaining improvements, but in no case shall
be surety be less than 20% of the cost of all of the public and quasi-public
improvements.
   (F)   Surety reductions. The amount of the subdivision performance guarantee
may be reduced once prior to conditional acceptance of all improvements. Upon
substantial completion of major segments of public improvements with
appropriate documentation submitted by the developer’s engineer, and after
initial tentative acceptance of the completed improvements by the Village
Engineer, the amount of the performance guarantee may be reduced to reflect the
segments completed, but in no case shall the remaining surety be less than 20%
of the cost of completing the entire improvements, all upon approval by the
Village Attorney and the Village Engineer. Evidence of payment of contractors,
subcontractors, and material suppliers shall be provided prior to any reduction
in the amount of the surety.
   (G)   Surety amount upon conditional acceptance. Upon conditional acceptance
of all improvements, the owner may request a reduction in the amount of the
surety to 20% of the estimated cost of construction of all the subdivision
improvements.
   (H)   Final release of subdivision improvement performance bond and security
upon acceptance of improvements. Following the one year warranty period and
upon satisfactory completion of all maintenance work to correct defects on
subdivision improvements required by these regulations, upon request of the
owner, the Village Attorney upon direction from the Village Administrator shall
release the subdivision improvement performance bond and its security in its
entirety. The release of any or all of the bond and its security shall be in
writing on forms approved by the Village Attorney.
   (I)   Performance by the village of owner’s obligations. Should the owner
fail to perform the owner’s obligation to construct and correct defects in
public improvements as required by these regulations or fail to pay
contractors, the village may liquidate any performance security in the
village’s possession and use the proceeds to construct or correct the
improvements in whole or in part as the village in its sole discretion deems
appropriate.
   (J)   Owner to pay village’s actual costs of construction or remedying any
defect.
      (1)   Owner to pay all costs if defective. Notwithstanding the amount of
the subdivision improvement performance bond or surety, the owner of the
subdivision shall pay all costs the village actually incurs in design and
construction of improvements or correcting defects in any improvements the
owner is required to install and maintain pursuant to this chapter but which
the owner fails to design, construct or maintain free from defects in
accordance with this chapter. If the amount of money received by the village
from the subdivision improvements performance bond and its security is
insufficient to pay all such costs, the owner shall reimburse the village for
the remainder within 28 days of the village sending the owner a bill for the
balance due.
      (2)   Attorney fees to be paid. Should the village be required to
institute proceedings in court in order to collect any sum due under this
section or to enforce the provisions of the owner’s subdivision improvement
performance bond or to collect on the security pledged in support of said bond,
the village shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorney’s fees that it
incurs from the subdivider.

fees (if any).
   (F)   Infrastructure development fees.
      (1)   Infrastructure development fees are hereby established in lieu of
the subdivider making roadway improvements, public sanitary sewer improvements,
sidewalk improvements, or public water main improvements. The amount of
infrastructure development fees shall be as established from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Trustees.
      (2)   Fees collected by the village in lieu of construction of public
infrastructure at the time of development shall be placed in an interest
bearing account. Interest earned on such funds shall accrue to the fund. The
funds collected shall only be used to pay for the construction of public
infrastructure at any other locations where fees in lieu of public

shall be conditioned upon the owners recording a subdivision covenant, approved
by the Village Attorney, that states that any current or future owners of the
property will not object to any special assessment for sanitary sewer or water
main construction, if deemed necessary by the village in the future.
Alternatively, an infrastructure development fee as established by resolution
of the Board of Trustees may be paid in lieu of a commitment for future
construction.
      (2)   If sanitary sewers and/or public water mains exist within 500 feet
of a rural residential subdivision the Village Administrative Review Committee
shall deny the application for approval of a rural residential subdivision, and

§ 154.049 CERTIFICATE OF EXEMPTION.
   (A)   Purpose. The certificate of exemption is intended to allow minor
conveyances of property between contiguous land owners through an
administrative review process. This is an administrative procedure; that does
not require review by the Plan and Zoning Commission or Village Board of
Trustees. The proposed exemption is sent for outside agency review, and then it
is administratively approved by village staff.
   (B)   When certificate of exemption may apply. The owner of subdivided land

§ 154.050 AGRICULTURAL SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   Purpose. The agricultural subdivision review and approval process is
intended to expedite and to minimize public and private costs for the review of
subdivisions which have no required public improvements, which have little or
no existing public improvements, which will not negatively impact surrounding
property in a manner significantly different that if the property had not been
subdivided, which are used exclusively for agricultural purposes only, and thus
which do not require the Plan and Zoning Commission and the Board of Trustees
to make policy decisions.
   (B)   Introduction. The agricultural subdivision is used when large parcels
of land are being conveyed in rural areas for agricultural uses. This is an
administrative procedure; it does not require review by the Plan and Zoning
Commission or Village Board of Trustees. The proposed agricultural subdivision
is sent for outside agency review, and it is administratively approved.
   (C)   Eligibility. In agricultural subdivisions all proposed parcels shall
meet the following requirements:
      (1)   All parcels shall be only in agricultural uses, including pasture,
woodland, and farmstead and shall be accordingly zoned.

access to a public street is via an easement shall not be allowed.
   (D)   Form of application and required documents. The owner shall submit an
application for a agricultural subdivision to the Village Planner on forms
provided by the village. A completed application should include the following
items:
      (1)   Names, signatures and addresses of the property owner(s), developer
or subdivider, engineer and/or land surveyor, and developer’s attorney.
      (2)   Four full size, one 11 inch by 17 inch Plat, and one pdf electronic
copy of the Plat of Survey prepared by an Illinois Licensed Land Surveyor. The
plat shall show:
         (a)   The length of all boundary lines of all adjacent streets, lots,
grounds, easements, rights-of-way and information sufficient to derive the
length of these lines. All dimensions shall be shown to hundredths of a foot,
except in the case of riparian boundaries, which may be described to the
nearest foot. A metes and bounds written description of the existing tracts and
identification of the proposed parcels shall be necessary in order for a legal
transaction to take place for the land being conveyed. Parcels shall be
numbered sequentially.
         (b)   The width of all rights-of-way and easements adjacent to,
impacting or serving the tract shall be indicated.
         (c)   The right-of-way of the adjacent township roadways shall be

range, meridian, county, and state.
         (h)   The description and location of all subdivision and public land
survey system survey monuments.
         (i)   Drawn to scale with north arrow and scale bar, with all capital
lettering not less than one-tenth inch in size.
      (3)   An application fee in the amount established from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Trustees.
      (4)   An electronic pdf copy of the plat and all supporting materials.
      (5)   One copy of all supporting materials.
      (6)   The original notarized signed owner’s certificate which shall
include any and all required covenants and public street right-of-way
dedications affecting the subdivision in the form set forth from time to time
via administrative rule.
      (7)   A drainage statement signed by the owner and the owner’s engineer
in the form prescribed in an administrative rule. A complete subsidiary
drainage plat will not be required.
      (8)   Evidence indicating that one copy of the plat of survey has been
mailed to each of the utility companies, and all public or quasi-public
agencies affected by the proposed subdivision. The mailing documents must

days thereafter, and that no comment in the time specified shall be deemed no
adverse comment.
   (E)   Approval procedure. All required documents must be submitted to the
Village Planner who will distribute the documents to the Administrative Review
Committee. The review and approval decision shall be completed no later than 14
calendar days after submission of a complete application in full satisfaction
of the provisions of these regulations. Unanimous approval must be given by the
Administrative Review Committee. Each member of the Administrative Review
Committee shall sign the certificate of approval. Failure of any of these
signatures to appear of the face of the certificate shall constitute denial of
the application. Approval must include affirmative findings that the proposed
subdivision is eligible for approval as an agricultural subdivision. If not
approved, the Village Planner shall notify the owner in writing within seven
days of denial.
   (F)   Limitation on agricultural subdivision approval. After approval of the
documents for a agricultural subdivision, the plat may be recorded by the
subdivider with the Recorder of Deeds, Champaign County, Illinois, within 90

notification of their decision to deny. Such request for appeal shall be made
in writing to the Village Planner. Following the written request for appeal,
the Village Planner shall schedule the appeal request before the Plan and
Zoning Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Plan and
Commission shall recommend to approve or deny the plat, in accordance with the
requirements of this ordinance, and shall forward their recommendations to the
Village Board of Trustees for consideration at their next regularly scheduled
meeting. The Board of Trustees shall approve or deny the subdivision in
accordance with the requirements for an agricultural subdivision, as set forth
elsewhere in this chapter.

§ 154.051 RE-SUBDIVIDING AND REPLATTING RECORDED LOTS AND FOR VACATION OF

   All regulations, procedures and standards made applicable herein to original
subdividing shall also apply to the re-subdividing and replatting of a plat or
parts thereof, as provided by these regulations.
   (A)   Procedure for re-subdivision. For any change of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if the change affects any street layout shown on the
Plat, or area reserved thereon for public use, or if it affects any map or plan
legally reached prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling
subdivision, such parcel shall be approved by the Plan and Zoning Commission
and Village Board of Trustees by the same procedure, rules and regulations as
for review and approval of a subdivision, or if the subdivision is classified
as a minor subdivision, under the procedures as set forth for review and
approval of a minor subdivision or if the subdivision meets the criteria for a
certificate of exception, such regulations and procedures shall apply.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivisions where future re-subdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
the lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller building sites, the Plan
and Zoning Commission and Village Board of Trustees may require that such
parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate
extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and
extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
   (C)   Vacation of plats.
      (1)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated.
      (2)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Board of Trustees in a
like manner as plats of subdivisions. The governing body may reject any such
instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public
uses, improvements, streets or alleys.
      (3)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded and filed, in like manner as plats of subdivision; and being duly
recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alley, and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.
      (4)   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner
herein provided the vacation is approved by all the owners of lots in the plat
joining in the execution of such in writing.

flood levels during the occurrence of the 100 year flood event.
   (D)   When a subdivision or part thereof is located in a flood-prone area as
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for which no base
flood elevation has been provided, or is located near to a waterway with a
watershed tributary area of 640 acres or more, the subdivider shall provide, at
his or her own expense, such hydrologic and hydraulic design data and

§ 154.057 WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS.
   (A)   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
enforcement of the regulations would entail practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships, the Village Board of Trustees by resolution, after
report by the Plan and Zoning Commission, may waive or defer them in such a way
that the subdivider is allowed to develop his or her property in a reasonable
manner, but at the same time, the public welfare and interests of the village
and county are protected and the general intent and spirit of the regulations
preserved.
   (B)   In the event it is deemed desirable to deviate from these subdivision
standards, by waiving or deferring such standard, the developer must submit, in
writing, a request to the Village Planner stating the requested waiver or
deferral, degree of deviation and the reasons why such waiver or deferral is
necessary or desirable. The waiver or deferral must be approved in writing by
the Board of Trustees prior to the final design work and shall apply to that
location and point in time only.
   (C)   Waiver not a matter of right. No waiver is available to a subdivider
as a matter of right. The burden of proving that a waiver is justified is on
the subdivider.
   (D)   Waiver requests. The subdivider shall submit all requests for waivers
in writing to the Village Planner at the time the area general plan,
preliminary plat, construction plans, or final plat is submitted. The
justification for the waiver and all facts relied upon by the subdivider shall
be submitted in writing along with the waiver request.
   (E)   Standard for waiver approval. The Plan and Zoning Commission may
consider and recommend, and the Village Board of Trustees may grant, waivers to
the provisions to these regulations. The waiver shall not be approved unless
the Village Board of Trustees finds that the waiver is justified according to
the following standards:
      (1)   There is substantial hardship in complying with these regulations
provided that the spirit and intent of this chapter shall be substantially
observed, and the public welfare and safety be assured;
      (2)   That the granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property located in the
vicinity of the property in question;
      (3)   The cost or difficulty of complying with the requirements of these
regulations is great compared to the gain such compliance provides to the
public health, safety, and welfare.
   (F)   Specific considerations. In deciding whether to approve a waiver from
this chapter, the Village Board of Trustees may consider, but is not limited
to, the following criteria:
      (1)   Whether the condition upon which the request for a waiver is based
is unique to the property, but not generally acceptable to other properties;
      (2)   Whether the property to be subdivided will be used only for farming
and related residential uses;
      (3)   Whether the property is a planned unit development approved under
the zoning ordinance, and the waivers are an approved part of the planned
development;
      (4)   Whether the waivers are included as part of an annexation or other
development agreement, provided that the standards for granting a waiver are
complied with;
      (5)   Whether conditions may be imposed which mitigate the harm to the
public caused by the failure to comply with these regulations.
   (G)   Conditions may be required. In approving waivers, the Village Board of
Trustees may require such conditions as will in its judgment secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of these
regulations. Conditions imposed for the purpose of mitigating the harm caused
to the public by the failure to comply with the provisions of these regulations
may include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Landscaping;
      (2)   Parking and on-site traffic regulation;
      (3)   Lighting, including the requirement of yard or lot lighting to
replace street lighting;
      (4)   Traffic regulation including, but not limited to, on-street
parking, one-side street parking, and one-way streets;
      (5)   Submission of the remaining tract for preliminary plat or final
plat approval prior to any construction or development.
      (6)   Dedication of additional right-of-way for streets, highways, or
easements for utilities and public infrastructure;
      (7)   Site plan approval;
      (8)   Access regulation;
      (9)   Payment of a fee in lieu of construction.
   (H)   Execution of a covenant. Execution of a covenant providing additional
requirements and/or conditions necessary to the approval of the waiver may be a
condition of a waiver. If a covenant is required as a condition, the covenant
must be approved by the Village Attorney prior to recording.
   (I)   Administrative waivers. The Village Administrative Review Committee
may grant minor waivers of subdivision regulation requirements
administratively, without review by the Board of Trustees. Such waivers may
involve small changes to construction requirements, or document preparation
requirements that do not materially impact the suitability or function of the
subdivision improvements and which do not result in an increase in current or
future costs to be incurred by the village.
   (J)   Deferral or waiver of required improvements.
      (1)   The Board of Trustees may defer or waive at the time of
construction plans or final plat approval, subject to appropriate conditions,
the requirements for construction for any or all public improvements as, in its
judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and
general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or in
existence of connecting facilities. Any determination to defer or waive
construction of any public improvement must be made on the record and the
reasons for deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.
      (2)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Board of Trustees to defer
the construction of any public or quasi-public improvement required under these
regulations because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or
nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall
pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the village prior to
the recording of the final plat.

agreement or subdivision approval requiring owners of benefitted property to
pay a fee for improvements built pursuant to said agreement or subdivision
approval, the village shall provide the owners of the proposed benefitted
property with at least 28 days notice of the hearing on said agreement before
the Board of Trustees. This hearing may be continued from time to time without
further notice to such owners by the Board of Trustees at its sole discretion,
upon request of any property owner subject to the assessment or at the Board of
Trustees direction, to a date certain.
   (D)   Payment of assessment required. Until such time as the owner of
benefitted property has paid to the village the amount assessed to the owner’s
benefitted property as required by adopted ordinance and said agreement or
subdivision approval plus any interest accrued thereon, or such owner has

Village of Mahomet to extend public water lines or sanitary sewers to provide
service to any lands within the applicable subdivision, nor does it obligate
the Village of Mahomet to construct street improvements, storm drainage
improvements, sidewalks, or other public infrastructure within the applicable
subdivision. Further, payment of a fee in lieu of construction does not relieve

      (1)   Throughout the entire permit application review period and the
construction period authorized by the permit, any amendments to information
contained in a permit application shall be submitted by the applicant in
writing to the village for review and village approval two business days prior
to any work effected by the amendment.
      (2)   In the event that the locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village.
         (a)   The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where
the locations of the facilities deviate from the locations approved in the
permit.
         (b)   If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the
requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for deviation in
accordance with this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance,
then the permittee shall modify the facility so that it conforms to the
requirements of this chapter and submit revised drawings or plans.
   (D)   Reimbursement of fees by applicant. Unless otherwise provided by
franchise, license, or similar agreement, all applications for permits pursuant
to this chapter shall be charged an application fee. However, in the event the
village determines that engineering or other outside review of the application
is necessary due to the size, scope, complexity of the proposed project from
review of the application and submittal documents, or if it involves or impacts
storm water management facilities or conflicts with other existing utilities,
the village may forward the permit application and the drawings, plans and
specifications to the Village Engineer's office, and/or other outside
consultants for review and if the Village Engineer deems it necessary, for
field observation and inspection of the work. The applicant shall be
responsible to reimburse the village for all of its out of pocket expenses in
reviewing applications and submittal documents, including, but not limited to,
design documents and for field observation fees charged to the village by the
Village Engineer's office, and/or other outside consultants, if any, charged to
the village and billed at their usual and customary rates charged
municipalities for similar services in assisting the village in reviewing
permit applications under this chapter. No application fee or additional review
fee is required to be paid by any electricity utility that is paying the
municipal electricity infrastructure maintenance fee pursuant to the
Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.
   (E)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the village within
a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to the
requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the
village shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor.
If the village is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements
of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations,
the village shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the village, that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Telecommunications retailers; additional village review of
applications.
         (a)   Pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Telephone Company Act (ILCS Ch.
220, Act 65, §4), a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that
it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The village shall specify the
portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used, and
constructed.
         (b)   In the event that the village fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a)
ten days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction; or
b) 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications
retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
         (c)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to this chapter, the telecommunications
retailer shall submit to the village an application for a permit and any and
all plans, specifications, and documentation available regarding the facility
to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of
this chapter.
      (2)   Holders of state authorization under the Cable and Video
Competition Law of 2007. Additional village review of applications by a utility
that is a holder of a state issued authorization under the Cable and Video
Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after submission to the
village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided the holder has
complied with applicable village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
   (F)   Effect of permit; authority granted; no property right or other
interest created. A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake
only certain activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-
way and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-
way.
      (1)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
      (2)   Preconstruction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting
shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such
village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence, or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
      (3)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations
of other jurisdictions having authority.
      (4)   Deviations. Unless a deviation request is granted, all permitted
work within the right-of-way shall comply with the requirements of this
chapter. All non-compliant facilities shall either be removed from the right-
of-way or modified so the facility is compliant.
      (5)   Inspections. Required inspections will be determined by the village
and communicated as part of the permit application approval. For any required
inspection and when construction is complete, the applicant shall notify the
village that the work is ready for inspection. The inspection will be conducted
by the village. Should the work be found unacceptable, the applicant shall have
30 days within which to upgrade the construction to meet the requirements of
this chapter. If, at the end of that time, the work is still unacceptable, the
village may complete the work and the applicant and/or owner shall reimburse
the village for costs incurred.
      (6)   Permit close out.
         (a)   Completion of permitted work. When the work is completed the
permit holder shall provide the village a complete set of as built plans with
depth information in the form of shape files with Z data or PDF drawn to scale.
The data should be georeferenced to the NAD_1983_StatePlane_
Illinois_East_FIPS_1201_Feet.
         (b)   Punch list inspection. Upon receipt of as-built plans, the
village shall inspect the completed work for compliance with this chapter
within ten days thereafter the permit holder shall complete, modify, repair,
replace all non-compliant work identified by the village.
   (G)   Security.
      (1)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a performance guarantee in a
form and in an amount as set forth in this chapter. The performance guarantee
shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this chapter at the
permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized
under the permit. The performance guarantee shall serve as security for:
         (a)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the
requirements of this chapter;
         (b)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this chapter; and
         (c)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
      (2)   Form. The permittee shall provide the performance guarantee to the
village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the Village Attorney, or an unconditional letter of credit
in a form acceptable to the Village Attorney. The permittee shall be required
to deliver documents and other evidence to the Village Attorney evidencing that
the issuing surety, bank, or financial institution meets the minimum
requirements set forth in this chapter. Any surety bond or letter of credit
provided pursuant to this subchapter shall, at a minimum:
         (a)   Provide that it will not be canceled without 45 day prior notice
to the village and the permittee;
         (b)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection
by the village of any amounts covered by it; and
         (c)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within
the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
      (3)   Amount. The dollar amount of the performance guarantee shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-
of-way and all public improvements to at least as good a condition as that
existing prior to the construction under the permit. The amount of the
performance guarantee shall also include the estimated cost to screen
facilities greater than 40 inches in height with vegetative landscaping and to
maintain and replace any failed landscaping for a period of two years (the
"two-year maintenance period"), as determined by the village, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location ora related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the performance guarantee for phased construction
shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this subchapter for any single phase.
      (4)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subchapter, may withdraw an amount from the performance guarantee,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the 14 day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
         (a)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         (b)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due
and unpaid;
         (c)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs,
or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of
any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
         (d)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount within the
limits of the performance guarantee.
      (5)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from
the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the performance guarantee,
the permittee shall restore the performance guarantee to the amount specified
in this chapter.
      (6)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect
to the performance guarantee are in addition to all other rights of the
village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund
shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with
respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
      (7)   Suitability of security. In the event the permittee elects to post
a surety bond as its security fund, the bond shall be issued by a surety
company or insurance company authorized by the Illinois Department of Insurance
to issue sureties in the State of Illinois. In the event the permittee elects
to post an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or savings and loan
association as its security fund, the issuing bank or savings and loan
association shall be federally insured and shall have assets of not less than
$50,000,000 and a capital asset ratio of not less than 6% unless the corporate
authorities otherwise determine and deem it good and sufficient security.
      (8)   Security not required. The village may determine that it is
unnecessary to provide security for certain projects. It is at the village's
sole discretion to determine when security is required.
   (H)   Permit suspension, enforcement and revocation.
      (1)   Village right to revoke permit. The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
         (a)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
         (b)   Noncompliance with this chapter;
         (c)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of- way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or
welfare;
         (d)   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the terms of the permit and approved plans; or
         (e)   Unexpected or excessive collateral damage to public
improvements.
      (2)   Notice of revocation or suspension. The village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter. The revocation is effective immediately upon receipt by the offending
entity. The revocation intent notice shall state the reason or reasons for the
revocation or suspension and the alternatives available to permittee under this
chapter.
      (3)   Permittee alternatives upon receipt of notice of revocation or
suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the village, the permittee shall have the following options:
         (a)   Immediately provide the village with evidence that no cause
exists for the revocation or suspension;
         (b)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         (c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such
removal to the village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
      (4)   Extension of time period. The village may, in its discretion, for
good cause shown, extend the time periods provided in this chapter.
      (5)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of
revocation or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately
upon discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within this
chapter. Work shall not be resumed after the issuance of a stop work order
except on the written permission of the village, if the stop order is oral, it
shall be followed by a written stop order.
      (6)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. The permittee shall
be liable in all events to the village for all costs of removal. If the
permittee fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the village at
the option of the village may:
         (a)   Correct the deficiencies;
         (b)   Upon not less than 20 days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject property, facilities or equipment; or
         (c)   After not less than 30 days' notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the village.
      (7)   Enforcement actions. The village may serve notice requiring removal
of any facility, obstruction, or encroachment within village right-of-way which
is in violation of this chapter. This notice may be served on the owner or
authorized agent, a tenant, architect, builder, contractor or other person who
commits or participates in any violation. The village may request that the
Village Attorney institute legal proceedings necessary to enforce this chapter
or to prevent or remedy any violations thereof. The village may also request
the assistance of the Village Police in enforcing this chapter. The owner or
tenant of any structure, premises or part thereof and any architect, builder,
contractor, agent or other person who commits, participates or assists in or
maintains any violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and
subjected to the penalties outlined in this chapter.

principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in the applicable IDOT publications, as amended from
time to time.
   (B)   Interpretation of municipal standards and principles. If a discrepancy
exists between or among differing principles and standards required by this
chapter, the village shall determine, in the exercise of sound engineering
judgment, which principles apply, and such decision shall be final. If
requested, the village, shall state which standard or principle will apply to
the construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the future.
   (C)   Traffic control.
      (1)   Minimum requirements. The village's minimum requirements for
traffic protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices and this code.
      (2)   Warning signs, protective devices, and flaggers. The utility is

flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable federal, state, and local
requirements for protection of the public and the utility's workers when
performing any work on the rights-of-way.
      (3)   Interference with traffic. All work shall be phased so that there
is minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      (4)   Notice when access is blocked. At least 48 hours prior to beginning
work that will partially or completely block access to any residence, business
or institution, the utility shall notify the resident, business or institution
of the approximate beginning time and duration of such work; provided, however,
that in cases involving emergency repairs pursuant to this chapter, the utility
shall provide such notice as is practicable under the circumstances.
      (6)   Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility's attention by the village.
   (D)   Location of facilities.
      (1)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements
applicable to specific types of utility facilities, all facilities, regardless
of type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this
subchapter.
         (a)   No interference with village facilities. No facilities shall be
placed in any location if the village determines that the proposed location
will require the relocation or displacement of any of the village's public
improvements or will otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of
any of the village's utility facilities.
         (b)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall
cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way
and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with
the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-
of-way.
         (c)   No interference with travel. No facility shall be placed in any
location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
         (d)   No limitations on visibility. No facility shall be placed in the
vision triangle at an intersection or at any location so as to limit visibility
of or by users of the right-of-way.
         (e)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use
the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals,
and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for
the application.
         (f)   No interference with drainage. No facilities shall be placed in
any location that results in a blockage or disruption of stormwater drainage
runoff.
         (g)   Underground utility lines shall comply with the minimum bury
depths established by the NFPA, NEC or applicable regulatory agency.
         (h)   All utility lines carrying potential contaminants shall be
located not less than two (2.0) feet below a village water line or water
service line, unless other protective measures are implemented.
      (2)   Parallel facilities located within street rights-of-way.
         (a)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may
be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
            1.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
            2.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
            3.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone as defined
by IDOT;
            4.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
            5.   Any ground mounted appurtenance is located within one foot
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way
line.
         (b)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel
facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a village street only
if:
            1.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
            2.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
village street only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with
sound engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing
conduit without disrupting the pavement); and
            3.   In the case of an underground power or communications line,
the facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and
not more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above ground
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
      (3)   Facilities crossing streets.
         (a)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village streets
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
         (b)   Culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities shall not
be located inside culverts or drainage facilities.
         (c)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross
at or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline of the street pavement as
practicable.
         (d)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
            1.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines";
            2.   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line of the highway and outside of the clear zone as defined by IDOT; and
            3.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
         (e)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground
power or communication facility may cross a village street only if:
            1.   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance free service life; and
            2.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs
is provided in the initial installation.
         (f)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker
at each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations.
      (4)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The
village may require that facilities be located within public utility easements
that are not street right-of-way when such a location is consistent with the
best interest of the village.
      (5)   Freestanding facilities.
         (a)   The village may restrict the location and size of any
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way.
         (b)   The village may require any freestanding facility greater than
40 inches in height and having any side greater than 40 inches in width and/or
depth located within a right-of-way to be screened from view with evergreen
vegetative landscaping such as Techny arborvitae, Austrian spruce, Norway
spruce, and as determined by the village after taking into account and
depending upon the suitability of the available space surrounding the
freestanding facility, the terrain, slope, location, access, surrounding uses,
safety, aesthetic and ongoing maintenance requirements and costs.
         (c)   Freestanding facilities greater than 24 inches in height shall
not be located within the visibility triangle of any street intersection or
within the visibility triangle of any driveway approach serving a multi-family,
commercial, or industrial use and the village street.
      (6)   Facilities installed aboveground. Aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
         (a)   No other existing facilities in the area are located
underground;
         (b)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
         (c)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
      (7)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
         (a)   Where practical, facilities may be installed as attachments to
bridges or roadway structures. Other means of construction may include, but are
not limited to, underground, underwater, and cable supports, all of which are
completely separated from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities
transmitting commodities that are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized,
especially those under significant pressure or potential, present high degrees
of risk and such installations are not permitted on bridges.
            1.   Attachment devices shall be made of metal.
            2.   Conduit all utilities shall be in encased in metal conduit or
appropriate equivalent to prevent sagging. Alternative conduit must be approved
by the village.
            3.   If sagging occurs the village reserves the right to cause the
utility that installed or currently owns it to replace with better material.
         (b)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
            1.   The type, volume, pressure, or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
            2.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the
highway structure in the transportation system;
            3.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
            4.   The proposed method of attachment;
            5.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
            6.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and
painting;
            7.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
            8.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as
compared to the risk involved.
      (7)   Appearance standards.
         (a)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
locations in order to preserve visual quality.
         (b)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
   (E)   Construction methods and materials.
      (1)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods are as follows:
         (a)   Boring or jacking.
            1.   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall
be accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the
village from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall be
excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring or jacking operations and
backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking operations are completed.
While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and protected by barricades.
Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced, and maintained so that
it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads that may be imposed upon
it during the boring or jacking operation.
            2.   Wet boring. Wet boring shall not be permitted under the
roadway or pavement.
            3.   Borings with diameters greater than five inches. Borings over
five inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and
following pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside
diameter of the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
            4.   Borings with diameters five inches or less. Shall not be
allowed within established neighborhoods.
            5.   Conduits, casings, carrier pipes six inches in diameter or
smaller shall generally be constructed via horizontal directional drilling or
microtunneling within existing neighborhoods. Extensive open cut trench

Notes:
1   A minimum distance is required from any part of the driveway approach and
the property line extended through the public right-of-way except when a
driveway approach is shared to serve adjacent properties. Shared driveway
approaches may be a maximum of 44 feet wide at both the private property line
and the street curb/pavement edge.
2   A driveway approach width cannot exceed 50% of the lot frontage along the
street for which the driveway approach accesses.
3   The Village Engineer may authorize a minimum separation distance that is
less for driveway approaches located in cul-de-sacs or when other site or
roadway conditions warrant a reduction in driveway approach separation.
 
               b.   All other driveway approaches including multiple-family
residential, commercial, industrial, conservation, and agricultural. Must be
approved by the village as part of site development plan review when applicable
or must be approved on an individual basis. A proposed driveway approach will
be reviewed based the intended use of the land.
            2.   Construction specifications. Driveway approach surface within
street right-of-way must be installed over a compacted subgrade as follows:
               a.   Compacted Crushed Stone Base: CA7 crushed stone or
equivalent as approved by the village, minimum thickness: six inches;
               b.   Preferred surface material: Portland cement concrete,
minimum thickness: six inches; and
               c.   Alternative surface material: bituminous concrete or other
material. Any use of bituminous concrete or other material must be approved by
the village. When bituminous concrete is approved, installation must be three
to four inch minimum thickness of bituminous concrete surface, constructed over
a six inch compacted crushed stone base. Any other approved material and
related construction must be approved by the village.
               d.   Side slopes: maximum: three horizontal, one vertical.
               e.   Driveway approaches shall be formed and poured separately
from driveway, sidewalk, curb or road edge via expansion joint material or
other approved method or material.
               f.   The finished grade of the driveway approach edge which
meets the roadway curb, roadway surface and sidewalk shall be level with the
adjacent roadway surface, roadway curb or sidewalk.
            3.   Drainage and culvert requirements. In no event shall any
driveway interfere with the existing drainage along and upon the right-of-way.
In all cases where the driveway or proposed driveway does or may interfere with
the existing drainage with the right-of-way, culverts shall be installed in
accordance with the following specifications.
               a.   Minimum diameter: 12 inches; larger culverts may be
required by the village for a specific location to provide adequate drainage.
The total cost of the required culvert is the responsibility of the owner. The
village may allow smaller culverts if it can be shown that a smaller culvert is
sufficient for current and future anticipated flows.
               b.   Piping materials may be of the following:
                  i.   Galvanized, corrugated steel pipe, minimum gauge: 16;
                  ii.   Aluminum alloy pipe, minimum gauge: 16;
                  iii.   Reinforced concrete sewer and culvert pipe which is
properly joined;
                  iv.   Corrugated outside/ smooth inside polyethylene culvert
pipe; and
                  v.   Other materials approved by the village.
               c.   Flow line of the culvert shall match the flow line of the
ditch unless requested by the village to be lowered to accommodate existing
conditions and future grading and cleaning. Prior to installation of the
culvert pipe, the ditch shall be graded and shaped as designed or as approved
by the village. The village may direct that the flow line of the culvert be
placed below the flow line of the existing ditch to allow for future grading
and cleaning of existing ditches.
               d.   Culvert length, excluding any end treatments, shall extend
at least one foot beyond the driveway approach surface material but in no case
shall be less than 12 feet in length. Any end treatment or culvert pipe end
section shall extend beyond the intersection of the driveway side slopes and
the flow line of the ditch.
               e.   Unless site conditions warrant a different design, a
minimum of one-half inch of cover excluding the required surface material shall
be required over the culvert pipe.
               f.   All culverts shall be installed with proper end sections
that fit the side slope of the ditch. End section material must match the
material of the culvert pipe installed and shall be securely fastened to the
pipe or placed in a manner to prevent settlement or collapse and/or blockage of
flow. The end of the pipe shall be of the same cross-sectional shape as the
interior of the pipe and shall not be dented or bent so as to reduce the pipe
diameter, width or height at the location by more than 4% (one-half-inch in 12
inches). Pipes failing this requirement will have to be removed and replaced
prior to driveway construction. The use of alternative end treatments such as
headwalls or slopewalls shall be approved by the village. Some end treatments
may not be allowed in areas of high traffic, deep ditches or where existing
conditions prohibit.
            4.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks through all driveway approaches shall be
a minimum of six inches thick Portland Cement concrete and shall be constructed
in accordance with the Village Subdivision Ordinance. Where new driveway
approaches are constructed adjacent to existing sidewalks, any sidewalk not in
conformance with this section shall be removed and replaced and the sidewalk
width shall match the adjacent exiting sidewalk. Driveway approaches shall be
formed and poured separately from sidewalks.
            5.   No village guarantee. While requiring minimum standards for
driveway approach and culvert construction, the village does not guarantee that
these minimum standards are adequate for the intended use of the improvements.
            6.   The village reserves the right to deny direct driveway
approach access to any right-of-way within the village. Any property with
multiple right-of-way frontages may be required to have access off of an alley,
secondary frontage or off of the right-of-way frontage with the lowest roadway
classification.
      (3)   Materials.
         (a)   General standards. The materials used in constructing facilities
within rights-of-way shall be those meeting the accepted standards of the
appropriate industry, the applicable portions of IDOT's "Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction", the Standard Specification
for Water and Sewer Construction in Illinois, the requirements of the Illinois
Commerce Commission, or the standards established by other official regulatory
agencies for the appropriate industry/utility.
         (b)   Material storage on right-of-way. No material shall be stored on
the right-of-way without the prior written approval of the village. When such
storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross arms, or other
materials shall be distributed along the right-of-way prior to and during
installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public or which does not
create an obstacle to right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way
and other property. If material is to be stored on right-of-way, prior approval
must be obtained from the village.
         (c)   Hazardous materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the
village shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the
construction of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
      (4)   Operational restrictions. Construction operations on rights-of-way
may, at the discretion of the village, be required to be discontinued when such
operations would create hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and
welfare. Such operations may also be required to be discontinued or restricted
when conditions are such that construction would result in extensive damage to
the right-of-way or other property. These restrictions may be waived by the
village when emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
      (5)   Location of existing facilities. Any utility proposing to construct
facilities within the village shall contact JULIE and ascertain the presence
and location of existing aboveground and underground facilities within the
rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The village will make
its permit records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying
possible facilities. When notified of an excavation or when requested by the
village or by JULIE, a utility shall locate and physically mark its underground
facilities including service lines within 48 hours, excluding weekends and
holidays, in accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage
Prevention Act.

terms with the village as permitted by law. The electric utility shall provide
appropriate traffic control per MUTCD. The electric utility shall not disrupt
or obstruct the right-of-way.
   (B)   Other utilities; tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
   (C)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (D)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means and methods.
   (E)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in the following subchapter, no utility shall

village as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each
provision of this chapter from which a deviation is requested and the reasons
why a deviation should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant deviations. The village shall decide whether a
deviation is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
deviation request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of deviation. The village may authorize a
deviation only if the utility or applicant requesting the deviation has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility or
applicant (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations, or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a deviation is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a deviation. As a condition for
authorizing a deviation, the village may require the utility or applicant
requesting the deviation to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may
or may not be expressly contained within this chapter, but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility or applicant aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision, or determination, including denial of a deviation, made
by the village under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the Village Board of Trustees. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such

repairing or maintaining a facility must comply with the following
requirements: All open cut trenches made either to existing pavements or
sidewalks or in future pavement areas shall be backfilled utilizing one of two
recommended methods: those being the use of controlled low strength materials
(CLSM) or, alternately, the placement of thin (six-inch maximum) mechanically
compacted lifts of CA6 or CA10 aggregate materials as approved by the village.
Water jetting of the aggregate backfill material will not be permitted. The
proper backfill material shall extend not less than two feet In each direction
from the edge of the pavement.
   (C)   For both the CLSM and granular backfill methods, the top 12 inches of
the excavation shall be filled with soil or granular material of similar
composition to that of the adjacent subgrade. The 12 inches of soil shall be
compacted to at least 95% of maximum dry density (AASHTO T99) with no more than
110% optimum moisture.
   (D)   When a trench is cut into an existing pavement or sidewalk, the
pavement shall be replaced in kind with a total thickness two inches greater
than existing to a maximum often inches. When restoring Portland Cement
concrete pavement, the entire slab into which the trench was cut shall be

carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Building Official shall have
the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the
Building Official shall first find that special individual reason makes the
strict letter of this chapter impractical and the modification is in compliance
with the intent and purpose of this chapter and that such modification does not
lessen health, life, fire safety or structural requirements. The details of
action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the official
department records.
      (1)   Flood hazard areas. The Building Official shall not grant
modifications to any provisions required in flood hazard areas as established
in Table R301.2(1) herein unless a determination has been made that:

characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the site render the
elevation standards of 2021 IRC Section R322 inappropriate;
         (b)   Failure to grant the modification would result in exceptional
hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable;
         (c)   The granting of modification will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws
or ordinances;
         (d)   The modification is the minimum necessary to afford relief,
considering the flood hazard;
         (e)   Written notice specifying the difference between the design
flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced floor elevation and stating that construction below
the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property, has been
submitted to the applicant;
         (f)   A variance of the requirements of
Chapter 151 of the Mahomet Municipal Code has been granted by the Village of
Mahomet Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (2)   Alternative materials, design and methods of construction and

installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of
construction not specifically prescribed by this chapter, provided that any
such alternative has been approved. An alternative material, design or method
of construction shall be approved where the Building Official finds that the
proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions
of this chapter, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the
purpose intended, not less than the equivalent of that prescribed in this
chapter. Compliance with the specific performance-based provisions of the
International Codes shall be an alternative to the specific requirements of
this chapter. Where the alternative material, design or method of construction
is not approved, the Building Official shall respond in writing, stating the
reasons why the alternative was not approved.
         (b)   Where there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, or evidence that a material or method does not
conform to the requirements of this chapter, or in order to substantiate claims
for alternative materials or methods, the Building Official shall have the
authority to require tests as evidence of compliance to be made at no expense
to the village. Test methods shall be as specified in this chapter or by other
recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test
methods, the Building Official shall approve the testing procedures. Tests
