offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform

abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of
the village herein repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances

any right of the village under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at
the time of the adoption of this code.

compel the attendance of absentees, under whatever penalties, including a fine
for a failure to attend, the Board may prescribe by ordinance.
   (B)   Based on the limited number of municipal meetings to accomplish the
work of the village, it is vital to have trustees attend such meetings to be
able to faithfully discharge their duties as trustees. In order to compel
attendance, a fine may be issued in the sum of $25 for each and every meeting a
member of the Board of Trustees fails to attend. Such fines may only be
assessed against those Trustees and in those situations wherein the Board of
Trustees by majority vote determines that the absent Trustee in question is
absent without reasonable notice being given to the Village President or
Village Clerk, and without a reasonable excuse, including, but not limited to,
illness, personal or family emergencies. Further, in such situations whereas a
Trustee has been absent on at least two occasions within any one quarter of the
year and such absences have been determined by the Board of Trustees to be to
the detriment of the operation of the Board of Trustees, the Trustee shall
resign from his or her position.
   (C)   The fine amount stated above may be increased up to the maximum set
forth herein by majority vote of the Board of Trustees, and may be imposed upon
each and every absence again by majority vote of the Board of Trustees.

         (a)   No Trustee shall speak more than once on the same question,

      (19)   Motions to lay on the table and to take from table.
         (a)   A motion simply to lay the question on the table shall not be
debatable, but a motion to lay on the table and publish or with any other
condition shall be subject to amendment and debate.

may be proposed at the same meeting at which such motion or proposition was
laid upon the table, provided two-thirds of the Trustees vote therefor.
         (c)   A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the

attributes so far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone
indefinitely or to a time certain.
      (21)   Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall
take precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.

voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that, where a motion has received
a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the
passage or adoption of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider
may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such
question to be reconsidered.
      (26)   Adoption of Robert’s Rules of Order Revised. The rules of

governing the passage of any ordinance, resolution or motion; provided that,
where the Board consists of an odd number of Trustees, the vote of the majority
of the Trustees shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance. The yeas and nays
shall be taken upon the question of the passage of the designated ordinances,
resolutions or motions and recorded in the journal of the Village Board.

questions of the passage on any two or more of the designated ordinances,
orders, resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes in a single
group, which single vote shall entered separately in the journal under the

“omnibus vote” in the journal in each case in lieu of entering names of the
members of Village Board voting “yea” and those voting “nay” on the passage of
each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolution and motions included in
such omnibus group. The taking of such single or omnibus vote and such entries
of the words “omnibus vote” in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance
with the requirements of this section to all intents and purposes and with like
effect as if the vote in each case had been separately by yeas and nays on the
question of the passage of each order, resolution and motion included in such
omnibus group, and separately recorded in the journal.

she shall sign them. Those of which he or she disapproved shall be returned to
the Village Board, with his or her written objections, at the next regular
meeting of the Village Board occurring not less than five days after their
passage. The Mayor may disapprove of any one or more sums appropriated in any
ordinance, resolution or motion making an appropriation and, if so, the
remainder shall be effective.
      (2)   However, the Mayor may disapprove entirely of an ordinance,
resolution or motion making an appropriation. If the Mayor fails to return any
ordinance or any specified resolution or motion with his or her written
objections, within the designated time, it shall become effective despite the
absence of his or her signature.

(Prior Code, § 38-1-3) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
RATES AND REGULATIONS
§ 50.15 CONTRACT FOR UTILITIES SERVICES.
   (A)   Customer accepts service. The rates, rules and regulations contained
in this public works title shall constitute and be considered a part of the
contract with every person, company or corporation who is supplied with water
and sewer services from the waterworks and sewerage system and every person,
company or corporation, hereinafter called a “customer”, who accepts and uses
village water and sewer services shall be held to have consented to be bound
thereby.
   (B)   Not liable for interrupted service. The Department shall endeavor at
all times to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of service, but in case
the supply of service shall be interrupted or irregular, or defective, or fail
from causes beyond its control, or through ordinary negligence of employees,
servants or agents, the Department shall not be liable therefor.
   (C)   Using services without paying. Any person using utility services from
the village without paying therefor, or who shall be found guilty of breaking
the seal of any meter or appurtenances, or by-pass any meter, shall be guilty
of violating this public works title and, upon conviction, shall be fined a sum
as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (D)   Destroying property. Any person found guilty of defacing, tampering,
injuring or destroying, or in any manner limiting the use or availability of
any meter or any property of the waterworks system and sewerage system, or
erecting signs on the property of the Department without permission shall, upon
conviction for such act, be fined as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (E)   Service obtained by fraud. All contracts for water and sewer services
must be made in the name of the head of the household, firm or corporation
using the established spelling of that person’s or firm’s name. Attempts to
obtain service by the use of other names, different spellings or by
substituting other persons or firms will be considered a subterfuge and service
will be denied. If service has been discontinued because of non-payment of
bills, or any unpaid obligation and service has again been obtained through
subterfuge, misrepresentation or fraud, that service will be promptly
disconnected and the whole or such part of the advanced payment as may be
necessary to satisfy the unpaid obligation shall be retained by the village and
credited to the appropriate account.
   (F)   Failure to receive bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a
customer from his or her obligation to pay within the time specified. Should
the Department be unable to bill a customer for services used during any month,
the following billing shall include the charges for services used during the
unbilled month.
   (G)   Request to discontinue service. Customers shall notify the village ten
days prior to the first day of the new billing month to discontinue services,
if the village is not notified ten days prior to the first day of the new
billing month, the customer shall be responsible for the service provided for
that month.
   (H)   Billing; utility shut-off.
      (1)   The water meters will be read by village representatives on or
about the second week of each month. If weather conditions or other
circumstances prevent the reading of the water meters then each utility bill
will be estimated by the village. All bills for utility services shall be due
and payable upon presentation. If a bill is not paid by the fifteenth day of
the following month, a penalty equal to 20% of the amount due on said bill
shall be added to the bill. This penalty shall be in addition to the charge
heretofore established for the utility services. In the event that any check
presented for payment of utility service is returned not paid to the village
(e.g., for insufficient funds, account closed and the like) a charge in the
amount of $25 for each check delivered shall be assessed. This charge shall not
preclude the village from pursuing any other civil or criminal remedies
available by law.
      (2)   Any customer who fails to pay the utility bills within a week of
presentation shall have the utility services disconnected after notice by the
Collector has been mailed to the customer.
   (I)   Lien notice. Whenever a bill for utility services remains unpaid for
60 days after it has been rendered, the village shall file with the county’s
Recorder of Deeds a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the
legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a
notice that the municipality claims a lien for this amount as well as for all
charges for utility services served subsequent to the period covered by the
bill.
      (1)   If the consumer of utility services whose bill is unpaid is not the
owner of the premises and the village has notice of this, then the notice shall
be mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her address is known to the
village whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after it has
been rendered.
      (2)   The failure of the Collector to record such lien or to mail such
notice, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the
right to foreclose the lien for unpaid utility bills as mentioned herein.
   (J)   Foreclosure of lien.
      (1)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility charges shall be sold
for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to
pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens.
      (2)   The Village Attorney is hereby authorized to institute such
proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over
such matters against any property for which the bill for utility services has
remained unpaid 60 days after it has been rendered.
   (K)   Landowner responsible for water and sewer accounts.
      (1)   All water and sewer accounts shall be the responsibility of both
the tenant and the landowner (joint and severally).
      (2)   The landowner shall be responsible for the deposit and monthly
bills on the water and sewer accounts if after demand has been made to the
tenant, the tenant fails to pay the amount due and payable.
      (3)   Notice of the tenant’s failure to pay shall be forwarded to the
landowner.
(Prior Code, § 38-2-1) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 50.16 CONSUMER LISTS.
   It is hereby made the duty of the village to prepare or cause to be prepared
a complete and accurate list of all premises and properties receiving utility
services, showing the name and address of the occupant and the owner of the
same. The list shall be kept up-to-date and shall be corrected from time to
time to allow changes in the occupancy or ownership of any such property or
premises. It shall be presented at the regular monthly meeting if requested.
Landowners shall notify the village of their current address or any change of
their address. Landowners who rent their property for residential or commercial
use shall provide the name and address of their tenants to the village.
(Prior Code, § 38-2-2) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 50.17 LIABILITY FOR CHARGES.
   The occupant of any lot, parcel of land or premises, receiving utility
services, the user of any such utility services and the landowner shall be

parcel of land or premises.
(Prior Code, § 38-2-3) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 50.18 ESTIMATED CHARGE.
   Whenever any meter, by reason of its being out of repair or for any reason
fails to properly register the utilities passing through, the consumer shall be
charged the average charge of the previous three months’ usage. If no record of
the previous three months exists, then the village shall estimate the amount of
utilities consumed during the time the meter fails to operate and the consumer
shall be charged with such estimated amount. Bills may be estimated whenever it
is impossible to read the meters during inclement weather.
(Prior Code, § 38-2-4) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 50.19 NO FREE UTILITY SERVICE.
   No free utility service shall be furnished to any person, public or private,

and Village Board reserve the right to impose special rates and charges in
cases where particular circumstances render the regular rates inadequate or
unjust.
(Prior Code, § 38-2-5) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 50.20 UTILITY DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Deposit. If the application for utility services is made by the owner
or owners of the real estate, and no other person has an interest in the
property as tenant, lessee, contract purchaser or otherwise, the owner/
applicant shall tender with the application a security deposit in the amount of
$100. If the premises are under lease, or if the premises otherwise have a
tenant, or if any person other than the owner of record has any right, title,
interest or claim in and to use of the premises, the application shall be by
both the owner and the person having some claim as tenant, renter, purchaser
under contract or person having some other interest in the premises, the
application shall be signed both by the owner or owners and the other person
having an interest in the premises, and the application shall be accompanied by
a security deposit in the amount of $300. If the Clerk of the village shall
determine, in his or her absolute discretion, that the deposit herein specified
is not sufficient to adequately protect the Water and the Sewer Department and
therefore village, a greater amount than stated above, may be required with
said amount to be based upon the consumer’s estimate bill for a customary
billing period, the consumer’s history of non-payment for services, consumer’s
history of utility shut-offs, or any other relevant information known to the
Village Clerk.
   (B)   Security for payment; no interest. The deposits made under the
provisions of this public works title shall be held by the village as security
for the payment of utility services used by the applicant upon the premises to
which his application pertains, and may be so applied when any default is made
in the payment in the utilities bill in accordance with this public works
title. The depositor shall earn no interest. If the applicant is the owner of
the property, the deposit may be returned if he or she moves out of town and
all previous bills have been paid.
   (C)   Liability for deposit.
      (1)   The owner of the premises and the tenant thereof shall be jointly
and severally liable to pay the required deposit herein established before
water and sewer facilities shall be made available to the tenant-occupied
premises.
      (2)   In case a portion of the deposit is used as aforesaid, the tenant
and/or owner of the premises shall immediately deposit with the Village Clerk
an amount sufficient to bring the deposit to the established rate of deposit.

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 52.160 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied
by the wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user
charge for operation and maintenance, plus replacement, a debt service charge
and a surcharge, if applicable.
   (B)   The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt
service of all outstanding loans by the number of users. Through further
divisions, the monthly debt service charge can be computed.
   (C)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day, 20°C BOD of 200 mg/l; and
      (2)   A SS content of 250 mg/l.
(Prior Code, § 38-4-20) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 52.161 COMPUTATION OF OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT COSTS.
   The sewer charges shall consist of operation and maintenance costs, plus
replacement, and shall be computed as follows:
   (A)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain
the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all
works categories;
   (B)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by
volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible;
   (C)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated;
   (D)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength; and
   (E)   Compute surcharge costs per 1,000 gallons per mg/l in excess of normal
sewage strength for BOD and SS.
(Prior Code, § 38-4-21) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 52.162 SURCHARGE AND SEWER CHARGES.
   (A)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS
respectively.
   (B)   Section 52.165 of this chapter specifies the procedure to compute a

including replacement costs.
(Prior Code, § 38-4-23) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 52.164 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
100 gallons.
   (A)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type
approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the village.
(Prior Code, § 38-4-24) (Ord. 06-382, passed 12-18-2006)
§ 52.165 COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE.

§ 72.51 NO PASSING ZONES.
   (A)   The Department and local authorities are authorized to determine those
portions of any highway under their respective jurisdictions where overtaking
and passing or driving on the left of the roadway should be especially
hazardous and may by appropriate signs or markings on the roadway indicate the
beginning and end of such zones. Upon request of a local school board, the
Department or local authority which has jurisdiction over the roadway in
questions shall determine whether a hazardous situation exists at a particular
location and warrants a no passing zone. If the Department or local authority
determines that a no passing zone is warranted, the school board and the
Department or local authority shall share equally the cost of designating the
no passing zone by signs and markings. When such signs are markings are in
place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a
vehicle shall obey the directions thereof.
   (B)   Where signs or markings are in place to define a no passing zone as
set forth in division (A) above, no driver may, at any time, drive on the left
side of the roadway within the no passing zone or on the left side of any
pavement striping designed to mark such no passing zone throughout its length.
   (C)   This section does not apply under the conditions described in 625 ILCS
5/11-701(a)2, nor to the driver of a vehicle turning left into or from an
alley, private road or driveway. The pavement striping designed to mark the no
passing zone may be crossed from the left hand lane for the purpose of
completing a pass that was begun prior to the beginning of the zone in the
driver’s direction of travel.
   (D)   Special speed limit areas required under 625 ILCS 5/11-605 in
unincorporated areas only shall also be no passing zones.

      (2)   The driver of a vehicle tending to turn left at any intersection
shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand land lawfully
available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle, and
after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so as to leave
intersection in a lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction
upon the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be
made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
      (3)   The Department and local authorities in their respective
jurisdictions may cause official traffic-control devices to be placed within or
adjacent to intersections and thereby require and direct that a different
course from that specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at
an intersection and, when such devices are so placed, no driver of a vehicle
shall turn a vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required by
such devices.
   (B)   Where a special lane for making left turns by drivers proceeding in
opposite has been indicated by official traffic-control devices:
      (1)   A left turn shall not be made from any other lane; and
      (2)   A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane except when preparing for
or making a left turn from or into the roadway or when preparing for or making
a U-turn when otherwise permitted by law.
   (C)   When a motor vehicle and a mass transit bus are traveling in the same
direction on the same multi-laned highway, street or road, the operator of the
motor vehicle overtaking such bus, which is stopped at an intersection on the
right side of the roadway to receive or discharge passengers, shall pass to the
left of the bus at a safe distance and shall not turn to the right in front of
the bus at that intersection.

otherwise turn a vehicle from a direct course or move right or left upon a
roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable safety. No
person may so turn any vehicle without giving an appropriate signal in a manner
hereinafter provided.
   (B)   A signal of intention to turn right of left, when required, must be
given continuously during not less than the last 100 feet traveled by the
vehicle before turning within a business or residence district, and such signal
must be given continuously during not less than the last 200 feet traveled by
the vehicle before turning outside a business or residence district.
   (C)   No person may stop or suddenly decrease the speed of a vehicle without
first giving an appropriate signal in the manner provided in this traffic code
to the driver of any vehicle immediately to the rear when there is opportunity
to give such a signal.
   (D)   The electric turn signal device required by 625 ILCS 5/12-208 must be
used to indicate an intention to turn, change lanes or start from a parallel
parked position, but must not be flashed as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to
operators of other vehicles approaching from the rear. However, such signal
devices may be flashed simultaneously on both sides of a motor vehicle to
indicate the presence of a vehicular traffic hazard requiring unusual care in
approaching, overtaking and passing.

§ 113.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the village, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually-
oriented business within the village. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually- oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Board, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton vs. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and Excalibur Group, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 116 F. 3d 1216 (CA8
1997) and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to,
Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on finding from the
Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually-
Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the village finds:
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually- oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus-infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States.
      (8)   The surgeon general of the United States in his or her report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection
may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn.
      (9)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (10)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (11)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult”-
oriented films.
      (12)   The findings noted in subsections (1) through (11) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (13)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (14)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually-oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee
is the actual operator of the sexually-oriented business, fully in possession
and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (15)   Prohibiting of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental
interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in
adult theaters.
      (16)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (17)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant government interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (18)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (19)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (20)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (21)   There are certain operational characteristics of sexually-oriented
businesses that have adverse secondary effects (noted herein) on communities,
including but not limited to the advertisement of sexually-oriented business
through the use of large signs, which contribute to the blighting and/or
downgrading of surrounding property.
      (22)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the village will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

Commissioner for a definite period of time for good cause shown. Good cause

conditions.

         (a)   In the event that a Class E license holder does not remove all
refuse, litter, debris and garbage as above required, within the 24-hour
period, or the extension of that period, the village may, after 24 hours’
notice, remove all refuse, litter, debris, garbage and the like from the
property used for the event. The notice shall also state that the failure of
the licensee to remove all refuse, litter, debris, garbage and the like within
the 24-hour period as required by such notice shall be deemed to form a
contract between the village and the licensee for payment of the costs of the
removal of the refuse, litter, debris, garbage and the like. Service of notice
shall be made upon the licensee and the owner of the real property for which
the license was issued. Service shall be by personal service; except that, if
the service cannot be made upon diligent inquiry, service may be made by
posting the notice on the property. The reasonable costs of removal shall be a
lien upon the real estate for which the license was issued.
         (b)   Whenever a bill for the reasonable costs of removal made
pursuant to this section shall remain unpaid for 30 days after it has been sent
to the licensee and owner of record, the Clerk shall file a notice of lien with
the County Recorder. The notice of lien shall be filed within 90 days after the
cost and expense of the removal has been incurred. It shall consist of a sworn
statement setting out a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification thereof, the amount of money representing the cost and expense
incurred or payable for the removal and the date to dates when such costs and
expenses were incurred by the village. The village lien shall not be valid as
to a purchaser whose rights in and to such real estate have arisen subsequent
to removal of the refuse, litter, debris, garbage and the like prior to the
filing of such notice, and the village’s lien shall not be valid as to any
mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lienor whose rights in and to such real
estate arise prior to the filing of such notice. Upon payment of the costs and
expenses after notice of the lien has been filed, the village shall release the
lien and the release may be filed or recorded as in the case of filing a notice
of lien. Costs and expenses under this section shall include, but are not
limited to, the actual costs and expenses for the time of village employees,
use of equipment and materials concerning the action to removal and
transportation to and from the property, title searches or certifications,
preparation of lien documents, foreclosure and other related reasonable
attorney expenses. If the costs and expenses for removal, as aforedescribed,
shall remain unpaid for a period of 30 days after the lien is filed, the
village may institute proceedings to foreclose the lien and the real estate may
be sold under the order of the court. If the payment of the village’s costs of
removal or abatement of the nuisance is not paid to the village within 30 days
of the billing of such costs the attorney for the village is empowered and
directed to commence proceedings in the circuit court seeking a personal
judgment from the licensee and/or owner of the premises. Such action shall be
based upon the implied consent for persons to form a contract for the removal
or abatement of the nuisance.

permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the permittee. The cost of
moving privately-owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee
unless other arrangements are made with the person owning the facility. The
permittee shall support and protect, by timbers or otherwise, all pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by
the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and
protect them under, over, along or across said work. The permittee shall secure
approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility.
   (B)   In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should
be damaged and, for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or devices
are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly
notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the
agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged
to the permittee. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall
assume all liability for damage to facilities and any damage and such
assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only
exception will be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the
negligence of the owning utility. The village shall not be made a party to any
action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the
existence and location of all underground facilities and protect the same
against damage.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-14)
§ 150.075 ABANDONMENT OF SUBSTRUCTURES.
   (A)   Whenever the use of a substructure is abandoned, except the
abandonment of service lines designed to serve single properties, the person
owning, using, controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 30 days
after such abandonment, file with the Street Superintendent a statement in
writing giving in detail the location of the substructure so abandoned.
   (B)   If such abandoned substructure is in the way or subsequently becomes
in the way of an installation of the village or any other public body, which
installation is pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove
such abandoned substructure or pay the cost of its removal during the course of
excavation for construction of the facility by the village or any other public
body.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-15)
§ 150.076 PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.
   (A)   The permittee shall, at all times, and at his or her own expense,
preserve and protect from injury, and adjoining property by providing proper
foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where, in the
protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for
the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall
obtain consent from the owner of such private property for such purpose and, if
he or she cannot obtain such consent, the Street Superintendent may authorize
him or her to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making the
property safe.
   (B)   At the permittee’s own expense, all buildings, walls, fences or other
property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work shall
be shored up and protected, and the permittee shall be responsible for all
damage to public or private property or highways resulting from failure to
properly protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the
permittee to trench through any lawn area, said area shall be reseeded or the
sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required in this subchapter. All construction and maintenance
work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth
and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed
before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any
trees or shrubs which exists in parking street areas without first obtaining
the consent of the appropriate village department or official having
supervision of such property.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-16) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 150.077 PLACEMENT OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   (A)   All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench
or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as to eliminate
danger to those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be a narrow alley, the Street Superintendent shall have the authority to
