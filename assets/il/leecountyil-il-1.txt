or any benefit in consideration for his or her participation in any prohibited
political activity.
   D.   Nothing in this section prohibits activities that are permissible for
an officer or employee to engage in as part of his or her official duties, or

paid in whole or in part by federal funds and that is subject to the federal

employment of the recipient or his or her spouse or immediate family member and

CHAPTER 13
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SECTION:
1-13-1: Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-13-2: Definition Of Sexual Harassment
1-13-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-13-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-13-5: Consequences Of A Violation
1-13-6: Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
1-13-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person on the basis of sex or gender. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of Lee County to prohibit harassment of
any person by any county official, county agent, county employee or county
agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All county officials, county
agents, county employees and county agencies or offices are prohibited from
sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or
lack thereof. The purpose of this policy is not to regulate personal morality
within Lee County. It is to ensure that at Lee County, all employees are free
from sexual harassment. (Ord. 01-18-002, 1-16-2018; amd. Ord. 02-21-003, 2-18-
2021)
1-13-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   A.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   While it is not easy to define precisely what types of conduct could
constitute sexual harassment, examples of prohibited behavior include:
      1.   Unwelcomed sexual advances;
      2.   Requests for sexual behaviors;
      3.   Obscene gestures;
      4.   Displays of sexually graphic photos, calendars, posters, or
magazines;
      5.   Sexually explicit e-mails or text messages;
      6.   Uninvited touching of a sexual nature;
      7.   Sexually related comments;
      8.   Any verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature;
      9.   Sexual joking, vulgar or offensive conversations or jokes; and/or
      10.   Teasing or conduct toward a person because of their gender.
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person." (Ord. 01-18-002, 1-16-2018; amd. Ord. 02-21-003, 2-18-
2021)
1-13-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   B.   If the employee feels they have been subjected to conduct which
violates this policy, they should immediately report the matter to the
Department Head, County Human Resource Representative, or the County Board
Chair. If unable for any reason to contact this person, or if the employee has
not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days after
reporting any incident of perceived harassment, the employee should contact the
County Board Chair. If the person toward whom the complaint is directed is one
of the individuals indicated above, the employee should contact any higher-
level supervisor in their reporting hierarchy.
   C.   Every report of perceived harassment will be fully investigated, and
corrective action will be taken where appropriate. All complaints will be kept
confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted, and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the county.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   D.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the county will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
   E.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time, and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   F.   The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and
effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that
problems can be identified and remedied by the county. However, all county
employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights
(IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information
regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must
be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days of the alleged incident(s) unless
it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within
three hundred (300) days.
   G.   The charge process for violations of the law can be initiated by
completing the form at https://www2.illinois.gov/DHR/Pages/default.aspx or by
contacting the IDHR at IDHR.lntake@illinois.gov, or any of these offices:

18-2021)
1-13-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No county official, county agency, county employee or county agency or
office shall take any retaliatory action against any county employee due to a
county employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   B.   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any county employee that is
taken in retaliation for a county employee's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this policy.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may
not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation, in addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire,
to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 01-18-002, 1-16-
2018; amd. Ord. 02-21-003, 2-18-2021)
1-13-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
county policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per offense, applicable
discipline or discharge by the County and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
County shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics
commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a State or
Federal agency. (Ord. 01-18-002, 1-16-2018; amd. Ord. 02-21-003, 2-18-2021)
1-13-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
   A.   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
county policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   B.   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging
a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous, or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 01-18-002, 1-16-2018;
amd. Ord. 02-21-003, 2-18-2021)

and community development, and the avoidance of work force reduction or

which are reasonably expected to cost in excess of two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000.00) or are reasonably expected to result in the creation or retention
of ten (10) or more jobs.

of the County Board shall be eligible, subject to limitations and provisions of
Zoning and Building Codes.

the limitations of State law, and the County Board may add such further
restrictions, limitations and conditions as it considers necessary.

development benefits, the time of filing and the total aggregate of all
outstanding abatements for application for abatement in any one year.
   F.   Qualification Pursuant To Statute: Reference to commercial or
industrial firms in this policy shall include any person or business entity
that qualifies as an applicant for tax abatement under 35 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 205/162, as the same may hereinafter be amended.
   G.   Project Commencement, Time Limit: All projects must be commenced not
less than ninety (90) days following approval of the application. (1983 Code §
16-33)
3-1-4: ABATEMENT TERMS:
The total aggregate abatement allowed any single applicant shall not exceed the
statutory maximum applicable, and no ordinance adopted pursuant to this policy
shall be construed to allow any excess abatement:
   A.   Amount: Firms that are qualified under Section
3-1-3 of this Chapter may be granted an abatement the amount of which shall not
exceed the following limits:
      1.   New commercial or industrial firms locating within the County or
existing firms expanding their facilities within the County, when such location
or expansion is reasonably expected to result in an increase in the work force
and an increase in the assessed valuation of the premises in question may be
granted an abatement up to one hundred percent (100%) of the additional taxes
which would otherwise arise as a result of the increase in the equalized
assessed value. A minimum abatement of fifty percent (50%) shall be granted
targeted industries.
      2.   Existing commercial or industrial firms expanding their facilities
within the County, when such expansion is reasonably expected to result in an
increase in the assessed value of the premises in question and no increase in
the work force, but is expected to retain existing employees, may be granted an
abatement up to seventy five percent (75%) of the additional taxes which would
otherwise arise as a result of the increase in the equalized assessed value. A
minimum abatement of twenty five percent (25%) shall be granted targeted
industries.
      3.   Existing commercial or industrial firms expanding their facilities
within the County reasonably expected to result in an increase of assessed
value, but no increase in the work force and a reduction in the existing work
force, may be granted an abatement up to fifty percent (50%) of the additional
taxes which would otherwise arise as a result of the increase in the equalized
assessed value.
   B.   Length: Firms that are qualified under Section
3-1-3 of this Chapter may be granted an abatement the length of which shall not
exceed the following limits:
      1.   New commercial or industrial firms locating within the County or
existing firms expanding their facilities within the County, when such location
or expansion is reasonably expected to result in an increase in the work force
and an increase in the assessed valuation of the premises in question may be
granted an abatement for not more than ten (10) years. A minimum abatement of
five (5) years shall be granted targeted industries.
      2.   Existing commercial or industrial firms expanding their facilities
within the County, when such expansion is reasonably expected to result in an
increase in the work force, but is expected to retain existing employees, may
be granted an abatement for not more than seven (7) years. A minimum abatement
of three (3) years shall be granted targeted industries.
      3.   Existing commercial or industrial firms expanding their facilities
within the County reasonably expected to result in an increase of assessed
value, but no increase in work force and a reduction in the existing work
force, may be granted an abatement for not more than five (5) years. A minimum
abatement of one year shall be granted targeted industries.
   C.   Computation:
      1.   Tax abatements shall be computed by:
         a.   Determining the current amount of taxes paid on the property in
question;
         b.   Estimating the increase in assessed value of the property as a
result of the proposed development;
         c.   Calculating the increase in taxes which would result from such
increase in assessed value at current tax rates; and
         d.   Applying the approved percentage and term (length) of abatement
to determine the total approved abatement in dollars.
      2.   The resolution adopting the abatement shall then establish the total
abatement approved and, where applicable, the amount of each installment.
Example: Land currently paying one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) annual tax. The
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) is the base, unabated tax. A qualified project
is estimated to increase equalized assessed value so as to result in three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00) in taxes annually. Tax abatement approved at fifty
percent (50%) over five (5) years. Total amount of abatement is five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00) (50% x $2,000.00 increase x 5 years). Resolution will grant
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) abatement in installments such as:
         a.   One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each year for five (5) years; or
         b.   One thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) in years 1 and two
(2); one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in year three (3), and five hundred
dollars ($500.00) in years four (4) and five (5).
Installments could be flexible. Each year taxpayer will pay the full amount of
the unabated tax ($1,000.00 in the example), and receive a credit in the agreed
amount towards the increase, if any, over the base, unabated tax.
   D.   Targeted Industries: By this Chapter and from time to time by adoption
of amendments hereto, certain industries shall be designated as "targeted
industries" for the purpose of economic development. It is the legislative
purpose of this County Board to determine and identify the types of industries
which are critical to the area's economy and future growth. The general
categories for such retention and growth activities are: food and kindred
products; printing and publishing; cement and concrete products; blast furnaces
and foundries; fabricated metal products and machinery; tourism; plastics;
leather products; manufacturer of retail products; insurance; and health care
and social services. Applicants within such industries shall be encouraged by
entitlement to minimum abatement. A complete schedule of such targeted
industries is attached to this resolution and made a part hereof.
   E.   Limitation: The actual amount and length of the abatement shall be
considered on a firm by firm basis using the guidelines and other criteria
established by the policy. (1983 Code § 16-34)

attorney of the county. The failure of any applicant to appear at the time and
place fixed by the liquor control commissioner for his examination or to
produce books and records requested, unless for good cause shown, shall be
deemed to be an admission that the applicant is not qualified to receive a
license. In the performance of such duties, the liquor control commissioner
maintains the right to hear testimony and take proof for his information in the
performance of his duties and for such purpose to issue subpoenas which shall
be effective in any part of this state. For the purpose of obtaining any of the

         a.   In addition to the foregoing, the applicant shall deposit with

the next fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in expenses. All expenses in
excess of one hundred twenty five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) shall be paid
by the County Board. The filing fee for all other types of PCFs shall be twenty
five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or such other filing fee amount approved by

shall be accompanied by payment of a supplemental fee of ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) 1 .
         b.   The applicable filing fee is intended to defray the reasonable

incident to the consideration of an application, the costs incident to
preparing the record for appeal, and the costs of representing the County on

         c.   If there are funds remaining in the filing fee deposit after
payment of the County costs, such amount shall be refunded to the applicant
upon the final resolution of the application process (including appeals to the
Illinois Pollution Control Board, Appellate Court, Illinois Supreme court,

any and all such additional costs and shall promptly pay over such additional
amount to the County upon request or demand.
      3.   Contents Of Application: The application must be complete and must

considered the official filing date for all time-limit purposes. The
application is not effective unless the application is in strict compliance
with this Chapter, the Articles of Rules and Procedures, and with the Act. At
any time prior to completion by the applicant of the presentation of the
applicant's factual evidence and an opportunity for cross-questioning by the
County Board, County representatives and any participants, the applicant may

shall construct or operate a Private Pipeline without first obtaining both a
special use permit and a building permit from Lee County.
      3.   Special Use. A Private Pipeline may be permitted in all districts,
except within Residential Zoning Districts or Platted Subdivisions, as a
special use, in accordance with the following regulations and performance
standards.
A petition for special use permit for a private pipeline must be on a form
approved by the County Zoning Administrator.
   D.   Performance and Design standards. The performance standards and bulk
regulations listed in §
10-15-1: Lighting of the Lee County Code; §
10-15-8: Fire and Explosion of the Lee County Code, and Chapter 13 Landscaping,
shall be suspended for a Private Pipeline and the following regulations shall
apply instead. All other performance standards and bulk regulations of the
district shall apply.
      1.   Other Standards and Codes. All Private Pipelines shall comply with
any applicable local, state and federal regulatory standards, including but not
limited to the Illinois Gas Pipeline Safety Act (220 ILCS 20).
      2.   The Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreement (AIMA).
         a.   An AIMA shall be executed between the Illinios Department of
Agriculture and operator of the Private Pipeline and shall be minimum standards
applied to all construction and deconstruction activities. The owner and
operator, contractors, and subcontractors must, at a minimum, comply with the

the AIMA. Where those standards conflict with standards outlined within, the
more restrictive shall apply.
         b.   If the Illinois Department of Agriculture does not require the
execution of an AIMA, the AIMA shall still be the minimum standards applied to
all construction and deconstruction activities. The owner and operator,
contractors, and subcontractors must, at a minimum, comply with the Conditions
of the AIMA and Construction Standards and Policies as set forth by the AIMA.

residence or a distance as determined by the pipeline impact radius, whichever
is the more restrictive of the two.
      4.   Pipeline Impact Radius. The pipeline impact radius for a gas
pipeline is similar to the potential impact radius identified by Title 49 of
the Code of Federal Regulations Part 192.903. Potential impact radius as
defined by 49 CFR 192.903 is determined by the formula r = 0.69*(square root of
(p*d2)), where ‘r’ is the radius of a circular area in feet surrounding the
point of failure, ‘p’ is the maximum allowable operating pressure in the
pipeline segment in pounds per square inch and ‘d’ is the nominal diameter of
the pipeline in inches. Maximum allowable operating pressure and nominal
diameter will be provided by the pipeline operator to the County at the time of
the application. The pipeline impact radius indicated in these regulations is
not necessarily the same as the potential impact radius used by the Illinois
Commerce Commission to enforce 49 CFR 192.903. Both the pipeline impact radius
and potential impact radiuses are approximations of the effect of any given
potential failure event.
         a.   The pipeline impact radius for a hazardous liquid pipeline is 150
feet.
         b.   No use, building, or structure established or built after the
effective date of this ordinance shall be located within a pipeline impact
radius expect as provided in paragraph IV.C.3.

accessory building, or accessory structure to a gas pipeline or hazardous
liquid pipeline or a wellhead.
            (3)   Enlargement, repair, and replacement of conforming uses,
buildings and structures that were lawfully established and existed on the
effective date of this ordinance.
            (4)   Uses, buildings, and structures established after the
effective date of this ordinance, on conforming lots of record that existed on
the effective date of this ordinance.
            (5)   Any outlot or street creation in any residential zone or
residential platted subdivision.
            (6)   Any portion of a lot containing a driveway and construction
of a driveway on any lot in any residentially zoned district.
         d.   Notice of pipeline impact radius.
            (1)   The County Zoning Administrator shall provide notice of the
existence of a pipeline impact radius to any landowner that submits a Zoning
Use Permit Application on any of the following:
               (A)   land that is located with a pipeline impact radius; or
               (B)   land that is subject to an easement for underground gas
storage; or
               (C)   land within 150 feet of an easement for underground gas
storage.
         e.   The notice shall include the following information:
               (A)   the approximate location and type of the relevant
pipeline; and
               (B)   the dimension of the pipeline impact radius including the
approximate location on the proposed LOT; and
               (C)   the last known point of contact for the relevant pipeline
operator.
      5.   Signage. All Private Pipelines shall follow the local, state and
federal guidelines for signing and marking an underground pipeline and its
appurtenances.
      6.   Lighting. If lighting is provided at any aboveground facilities,
lighting shall be shielded with a full cut-off fixture to minimize light
pollution on adjacent parcels.
      7.   The Applicant shall comply with all applicable Performance Standards
of the applicable zoning district as provided in §10-15 of the Lee County Code.
      8.   Construction Standards. The Applicant shall comply with all
Construction Standards and Policies as identified in the Agricultural Impact
Mitigation Agreement as provided by the Illinois Department of Agriculture even
if it is determined by the Illinois Department of Agriculture that one is not
required.
      9.   Outdoor Storage. Only the outdoor storage of materials, vehicles and
equipment that directly support the construction, operation and maintenance of
a Private Pipeline shall be allowed. The Zoning Administrator or their designee
shall have the discretion to determine whether outdoor storage complies with
this provision.
      10.   During construction of a Private Pipeline, construction activities
shall commence no earlier than 6:00 A.M. and shall be discontinued no later
than 9:00 P.M.
      11.   Revocation. The Special Use Permit may be revoked by the County at
any time for non-compliance of any of the conditions found within this
Ordinance. Any Lee County Zoning Board of Appeals recommendation to revoke the
Special Use for the inoperable/abandoned Private Pipeline Project facility
shall be forwarded to the full Lee County Board for consideration of the
recommended revocation of the Special Use Petition. Decommissioning of a

completed in a timely manner not to exceed two hundred forty (240) days after
the date of the revocation order by the Lee County Board. Up to one hundred
eighty (180) days of additional time to accomplish decommissioning and
restoration may be granted by the Lee County Zoning Administrator if the Lee
County Zoning Administrator determines that additional time is in the best
interests of Lee County, landowners and area highway authorities.
   E.   Application Requirements. Due to the unique nature and special
requirements of a Private Pipeline and the potential impacts of Private
Pipeline on adjoining properties and government services, the Private Pipeline
shall be required to submit and obtain approval on the following items in
addition to any requirements specified in the special use section of the County
Code or special conditions required by the County Board. The required
information must be submitted either with the application or during the hearing

8-1-13: ANALYSES:
   A.   Disinfection And Analysis: All components of a new water well
construction and/or modification shall be thoroughly disinfected with a strong
chlorine solution which will yield a dosage of at least one hundred (100) parts
per million to the water in the well. After purging the system of any chlorine
residual, a water sample shall be taken and satisfactory bacteriological
results, as confirmed by a certified laboratory, shall be obtained prior to
utilizing the water system for drinking and culinary purposes. Illinois
Department of Public Health requires that all new wells be tested to assure the
water supply is safe. The Lee County Health Department will collect one water
sample for each newly constructed or modified well permit issued. If the water
analysis is satisfactory the results will be sent to the homeowner and they may
consume their well water. If the analysis is unsatisfactory, a chlorination
procedure shall be sent to the homeowner and the well shall be retested until
satisfactory water results are obtained. A fee established by the Lee County
Board of Health will be applied for all retesting requests received by the Lee
County Health Department. This fee shall be paid by the homeowner within thirty
(30) days of service.
   B.   Continuing Analysis: It shall be the duty of every owner of every water
well serving a semi-private water system for more than one residence to have
the water therein bacteriologically analyzed by a certified laboratory as
required by the health authority for the protection of public health. Such
water shall also be bacteriologically analyzed whenever the water lines are
opened for repair, replacement, or extension of the water distribution system.
The water from a semiprivate water system shall meet the nitrate, chemical, and
bacteriological requirements contained in the Drinking Water Systems Code.
   C.   Facilities served by non-community private water wells (not connected
to municipal water systems), are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act and are
required to adhere to the sampling schedule mandated by the Illinois Department
of Public Health (title 77 section 900).
      1.   The Lee County Health Department may provide the option for non-
community water supplies to contract with the health department for the
collection of the facility’s required water samples. Each year the Lee County
Health Department shall provide each Non-Community supply an optional contract
for their supply. This fee amount shall be established by the Lee County Board
of Health. Facilities will have thirty (30) days to pay for this service.
      2.   If facilities elect to sample their own non-community supply, the
Lee County Health Department will upon receipt of a late sample notice for a
facility, mail the facility a notice granting an additional period of fourteen
(14) days in which to complete sampling requirements. If, after this period,
sampling has not been conducted and verified, this department will conduct the
sampling at the expense of the facility in the amount established by the Lee
County Board of Health, plus lab and postage fees. This amount shall be a
marginal increase from the contracted fee. Facilities will have thirty (30)
days to pay for this service.

the public health, safety and welfare of its citizens and to minimize conflict
between farming and other land uses.
   A.   These regulations are specifically designed to:
      1.   Conserve the value of land or buildings throughout the county and to
provide safe and affordable housing to county residents;
      2.   Provide a comfortable and moral environment for the benefit of the
residents of the county and maintain and enhance rural community values;
      3.   Lessen or avoid congestion in public streets and highways;
      4.   Lessen or avoid the hazards to persons and damage to property
resulting from the accumulation or runoff of storms or floodwaters;
      5.   Limit nonagricultural development in areas of prime farmland;
      6.   Encourage, preserve and protect the development and improvement of
agricultural land for the production of food, fiber and other agricultural
purposes and otherwise strengthen and maintain the economic base that
agricultural uses bring to the county;
      7.   Prevent scattered, haphazard or premature urbanization by limiting
new growth to appropriate locations;
      8.   Protect natural resources in the county including air quality,
watercourses, floodplains, wetlands, woodlands, steep slopes, wildlife habitats
and scenic vistas;
      9.   Preserve, encourage and enhance aesthetic considerations in
connection with development of any areas of the county;
      10.   Maintain and enhance the unincorporated towns and neighborhoods
presently existing in the county;

adopted policies.
   B.   To realize these goals this title establishes standards and adopts
objectives to assure orderly growth in the unincorporated and rural areas of
the county of agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial and
institutional uses by providing that:
      1.   All rezoning, special uses, variations, subdivisions and/or

agricultural or other open space uses until such services become available.
      3.   Detailed planning areas (DPA) shall be established from time to time
in areas presenting unique opportunities for economic development as identified
on the comprehensive plan map as (DPA), or as identified as potentially unique
opportunities for economic development in the future. Detailed plans for land
use, community character, utility provision, storm water quantity and quality
management, and economic development are needed before substantial development
is permitted in these areas.
      4.   Access points to development areas will be strictly limited and the
construction of private roads is discouraged in order to promote public safety
and to consolidate access points.
      5.   Extraction of minerals from appropriately identified areas shall be
encouraged subject to rules and regulations designed to protect the public from

      4.   No changes of any nature shall be made on the official zoning
classification map, or matters depicted thereon, except in conformity with the
procedure set forth in this title. Any unauthorized change of any kind by any
person or persons shall be considered a violation of this title, shall not be
construed as a map amendment, and shall be punishable as provided in this
title.
      5.   The official zoning classification map located in the office of the
zoning administrator shall be the final authority as to the current zoning
status of property, buildings and structures in the county, being paramount to
any purported copies thereof.
   C.   Uncertainty As To Boundaries: If uncertainty arises with respect to the
zoning boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning maps, the
zoning administrator shall determine the boundaries in accordance with the
following rules:
      1.   Zoning district boundaries, unless otherwise indicated, are the
centerline of streets, roadways, alleys, railroads or easements; or the
boundary lines of sections, quarter sections, or an even division thereof;
tracts or lots, or such lines extended.
      2.   Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot in single
ownership, the regulations of either zoning district may apply to the entire
lot, but under no circumstances, shall less than fifty feet (50') in an
adjoining district remain isolated in a separate zoning district.
      3.   In areas not divided into lots and blocks, the zoning district
boundary lines on the zoning maps shall be determined by scale to the nearest
fifty feet (50').
      4. In the AG-2 and AG-3 concentrated livestock production overlay
district the boundaries shall be determined by drawing a circle, the radius of
which shall be the applicable setback distance set out in 510 Illinois compiled
statutes 77/35(d) or those distances set forth in the regulations regarding AG-
2 and AG-3 districts.
      5.   In the water and steep slopes district the boundary lines of the
district shall be defined by the SFHA boundaries as herein defined from time to
time and by the soil and water conservation district maps published from time
to time. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-3-3: APPLICABILITY:
All land located in the county shall be classified in one underlying principal
district. The designation of any such land to an overlay district shall not
remove the underlying principal district classification. Overlay districts
impose additional restrictions where they are created over an underlying
principal district and take precedence over the privileges and requirements of
the underlying principal district. A particular parcel may be located in more
than one overlay district and subject to the requirements of several districts.
Designation of a parcel in an overlay district does not of itself eliminate the
applicability of the provisions, performance standards or applicable
regulations, relating to the underlying principal district, and the provisions
of the underlying principal district control except where there is conflict.

10-4-1: STATEMENT OF INTENT:
The intent of this title in establishing a rural/agricultural district is to
allow maximum freedom of operation for bona fide agricultural uses, and to
protect such from encroachment by other unrelated special uses which are
subject to the regulations and requirements specified in section
10-4-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-
22-2-25)
10-4-2: DEFINITIONS; RESIDENTIAL RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Definition:
   BONA FIDE AGRICULTURAL USES: Those uses set forth in the definition
"agriculture, agricultural use"; temporary uses such as roadside farm stands
devoted to the sale of farm products produced upon the land upon which the farm
stand is located with related signage; and farm buildings exempt from county
use and bulk regulations under 55 Illinois compiled statutes 5/5-12001.
   B.   Residential Restrictions:
      1.   One Dwelling Per Lot; Exceptions: Not more than one (1) dwelling may
be permitted on a single lot or farm, unless: a) the dwellings existed at the
time of the passage of this title; b) the dwelling existed as, or was under
construction as, a farm residence, which has been, or may be, converted to a
nonfarm residence; c) the dwellings exist as a special use for itinerant or
permanent farm laborers.
      2.   Parcels Less Than Forty Acres: A dwelling constructed on a parcel
less than forty (40) acres in size, or a parcel of land less than forty (40)
acres in size including a dwelling transferred to anyone, except the owner of
an adjoining farm, purporting to be transferred for agricultural use shall not
be construed to be a farm unless a signed statement shall be presented by the
owner to the zoning administrator, upon a form prescribed by the zoning
administrator and published in the "county development manual" attesting to the
authenticity of the agricultural use. It shall be determined by the zoning
administrator to be agricultural if: a) a majority of the total cash income of
the applicant is or shall be derived from pursuit of the agricultural
activities included in bona fide agricultural uses, on the parcel involved, and
b) the applicant is a member of the immediate family of the owner of an
adjoining farm or the owner of a farm on the opposite frontage to the parcel
involved. Such signed statement shall be filed in the records of the zoning
administrator.
      3.   LESA Report: The zoning administrator shall require a LESA report
before issuing a building or development permit, or allowing a subdivision or
resubdivision, or permitting residential construction or development on any
parcel zoned agricultural, or to rezone a parcel, or grant a special use
permit, or to grant a variation or expand or extend any special use permit on
any parcel zoned agricultural in the county. Should any residential
construction or development, or special use, or any expansion or extension
thereof, be desired on a parcel in an agricultural district with a LESA score
of two hundred twenty five (225) (or such other number which the county board
shall set from time to time), or more, a public hearing shall be required
before the planning commission with the intent of assisting in the decision of
whether to issue a building or development permit, allow a subdivision or
resubdivision, or grant a rezoning, special use permit, variation or expansion
or extension thereof.
      4.   New Dwellings: From and after the date of the adoption of this
title, as revised, in any quarter section by government survey, in an
agricultural district, no more than four (4) new dwelling units can be built,
platted or zoned in any agricultural classification, excepting a farm
residence. The zoning administrator shall note any new dwelling units on the
zoning maps and keep such additional records as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this subsection. Lots, less than forty (40) acres, which are
currently classified as a residential district are exempt from this provision,
except to the extent they are hereafter resubdivided into smaller lots, which
smaller lots shall be subject to the quarter section limitation on new dwelling
units. Dwellings constructed to replace buildings lost to fire or other
casualty are exempt from the provisions of this subsection.
      5.   Encroachment: The provisions of this section are intended to protect
bona fide agricultural uses from encroachment by incompatible uses in violation
of rules and regulations in this district and to restrict the development of
prime farmland. To the extent a parcel qualifies for residential development,
subdivision, construction or rezoning in this district the applicant is
encouraged to cluster residential uses into lots as small as two (2) acres.

classification map and the zoning maps. (Ord. 12-05-001, 12-20-2005; amd. Ord.
2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-8A-3: OWNER'S COMPLIANCE AFFIDAVIT; REVOCATION:
   A.   The continuation of the AG-2 and AG-3 district special use is not a
matter of right but is contingent upon the annual filing of an affidavit and
certification by the concentrated livestock production district owner or
operator, by March 1 of each year, that it continues to meet the requirements
of the district, and that the facility complies with any state laws regarding
the operation of livestock management facilities, if applicable, in such form
as is set out in the "county development manual" from time to time.
   B.   In the event no such annual affidavit and certification is timely
filed, it shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to investigate any such
AG-2 or AG-3 district. If after investigation the zoning administrator
determines that the area has not been used solely for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days in the prior year as a concentrated livestock production
district, said zoning administrator shall petition the zoning hearing officer
to revoke the designation and to rezone the property to AG-1.
   C.   The zoning hearing officer shall thereafter provide notice of hearing
and proceed in accordance with the same requirements applicable to any other
map amendment.
   D.   If the county board revokes the AG-2 or AG-3 designation the zoning
administrator shall remove the district and the noted public policy
restrictions from the official zoning classification map within sixty (60) days
from the date of the county board decision. The zoning administrator shall also
notify the board of trustees of any township in which the property is located,
which has established a plan commission, of any such removal within said sixty
(60) day period. (Ord. 12-05-001, 12-20-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-8A-4: PUBLIC POLICY:
   A.   It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the county that no new
subdivisions, mobile home parks, industrial development, publicly owned
recreation areas or schools shall be allowed within one-half (1/2) mile of any
existing AG-2 district, or one mile of any existing AG-3 district.
      Notwithstanding the aforesaid county public policy, the zoning hearing
officer may grant variations on a case by case basis from the setback
requirements in existing AG-2 and AG-3 districts after a hearing and making
written findings that the public interest and the interest of the livestock
production facility are not adversely affected by the development of any of the
aforesaid uses, and imposing on any such development conditions including
waivers being obtained from any owners or subdividers thereof, binding them,
and running with the land, acknowledging the inherent disadvantages involved
with development in proximity to livestock production facilities and holding
harmless the livestock production facility from claims and/or damages resulting
from the lawful operations of the livestock production facility. In granting
any such variations, the zoning hearing officer shall take into consideration
such factors as prevailing winds, intervening topography, location of waste

The comprehensive plan has identified public or private, existing or potential,
areas within the county as having particular, recreational or tourism
possibilities, or having special historical or archeological significance or as
natural areas desirable to tie into regional recreational, historical or
natural pathway goals. These areas are identified as active or special
recreation (AR) areas on the comprehensive plan. Among these areas are existing
golf courses and campgrounds, picnic areas, the Rock River trail, the Lincoln
Highway, historic Route 2, numerous abandoned railroad rights of way and sites
of historical, geological and archeological significance. It is the policy of
the county to encourage the development of these areas and adjacent areas for
recreational use and the promotion of tourism in the county by further
identifying them and by encouraging their utilization for recreational use at
the appropriate time by providing incentives and facilitations to owners of
said parcels to develop them for such uses or to provide easements for such
uses. The county is unable by itself to dedicate the resources necessary to
accomplish these goals and when necessary will enter into intergovernmental
agreements and public or private partnerships with local or regional
organizations to accomplish them. These areas will be designated on the zoning
maps from time to time, and subjected to special requirements in the event of
their impending development. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006,

10-8D-2: DESIGNATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAN:
The planning commission at the request of the county board shall hold hearings
from time to time to determine the appropriateness of designating areas as
active or special recreation (AR) areas. The planning commission shall consider
such questions as the public good, including benefits to tourism, additional
recreational potential, accessibility to and accommodations for the public,
including the disabled, costs of development, projected revenues to the county,
regional benefits, impact on property in the area, any necessary
intergovernmental or private agreements and any desirable zoning changes to
adjacent properties. The planning commission will file written findings with
the county board within sixty (60) days after the completion of the hearings.
The county board may accept, modify or disregard any such findings. In the
event the county board elects to proceed to designate such areas as active or
special recreation (AR) areas it shall refer to the zoning hearing officer any
matters requiring hearings by the zoning hearing officer under this title. The
zoning hearing officer shall hold hearings in the same manner and with the same
powers as it would in any special use zoning proceeding. The Zoning Hearing
Officer and/or the zoning administrator are encouraged to permit variations,
waivers or other modifications necessary to promote the public good in an
active or special recreation designated area. Upon approval of the designation
by the county board the same shall be reflected on the county zoning maps.

SECTION:
10-10B-1: Application
10-10B-2: Conditions And Restrictions
10-10B-3: Procedures
10-10B-1: APPLICATION:
When a property owner shows that a strict application of the terms of this
title relating to bulk regulations imposes upon him practical difficulties or
particular hardship, then the zoning hearing officer may in the following
instances only, make such variation of the strict application of the terms of
this title as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent when the
zoning hearing officer is satisfied, based upon the evidence heard before it,
that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the
applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable hardship so great as
to warrant a variation:
   A.   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divided a lot in single ownership as shown of record;
   B.   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been
destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its
value, by fire or act of God, or the public enemy, where the zoning hearing
officer shall find some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of
the nonconforming use, but in no case shall a permit be issued if its primary
function is to continue a monopoly.
   C.   To create a variation by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
or shape of a specific lot, or by reason of exceptional topographical
conditions, when the strict application of any provisions of this title would
result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or particular
hardship upon the owner of such property; provided such relief can be granted
without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially
impairing the general purposes and intent of the comprehensive plan as
established by the regulations and provisions contained in this title.
   D.   To waive the parking requirements in the business or industrial
districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking facilities, or where such regulations
would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted
with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
   E.   To permit a building to be erected, reconstructed altered or enlarged
so that the building lines will extend beyond the distance specified in this
title into side yards, or into front yards; provided, that such variation may
not be granted:
      1.   Unless there is a building in the block which extends beyond the
distance from the front street line specified in this title, in which case the
building line may be permitted to extend as near to the front street line as
such nonconforming building; or
      2.   Unless the lot is irregular in shape, topography or size; or
      3.   Unless the street line of the lot is irregular in shape, topography
or size. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)

legal nonconforming use and may be continued, except as otherwise provided
herein. Any legal nonconforming building, structure, sign or lot may be
continued in use provided there is no physical change other than necessary
maintenance and repair, except as otherwise permitted herein. Any building or
structure for which a permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective

may have been originally designed for the prior nonconforming use. Whenever a
nonconforming use of a building or structure, or part thereof, has been
discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or whenever there
is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming
use, such use shall not after being discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished
and the use of the premises thereafter shall be in conformity with the
regulations of the applicable district. Where a structure or a nonenclosed
building is involved, discontinuance of a nonconforming use shall constitute an
abandonment, and such structure or nonenclosed building shall not thereafter be
used in a nonconforming manner. A nonconforming use not authorized by this
title prior to the adoption hereof, shall be discontinued and not
reestablished, unless such use is a permitted use in the district in which it
is located after the adoption hereof. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)

nonconforming building, structure or lot containing adult entertainment
establishments experiencing an undue hardship due to the six (6) month
amortization period may request a longer amortization period by filing a
petition on forms provided by the zoning administrator and paying the fees set
out in the "county development manual" requesting a longer amortization period.
The filing of the petition shall not extend the six (6) month amortization
period. Such period may only be extended by a majority vote of the county board
after a hearing before the zoning hearing officer in the same manner and with
the same requirements as if said petition was a petition for a variation. (Ord.
06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-10C-6: REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS:
So long as a nonconforming building or structure is used, or is eligible for
use, normal maintenance of such building or structure is permitted including
necessary nonstructural repairs, replacement of roofing materials, veneering of
existing outer walls and incidental alterations which do not extend or
intensify the nonconforming use. No structural alteration shall be made to a
building or other structure containing a nonconforming use, except in the
following instances:
   A.   When the alteration is required by law;
   B.   When the alteration will result in the elimination of the nonconforming
use;
   C.   When a building containing residential nonconforming uses, other than
single-family dwellings, may be altered in such a way to improve livability,
provided no structural alteration shall be undertaken which would increase the
number of dwellings or the bulk of the building. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005;
amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-10C-7: ADDITIONS AND ENLARGEMENTS:
A nonconforming building may be enlarged or extended only if the entire
building is thereafter devoted to a conforming use, and is made to conform to
all the regulations of the district in which it is located. No building
partially occupied by a nonconforming use shall be altered in such a way as to
permit the enlargement or expansion of the space occupied by such nonconforming
use. No nonconforming use may be enlarged or extended in such a way as to
occupy any required usable open space, or any land beyond the boundaries of the
lot as it existed at the effective date hereof, or to displace any conforming
use in the same building or on the same lot. A building, structure or sign
which is nonconforming with respect to yards, maximum lot coverage, height or
any other bulk regulation shall not be altered or expanded in any manner which
would increase the degree or extent of its nonconformity with respect to the
bulk regulations applicable to the district in which it is located, unless such
building or structure is exempt under section
10-10C-8 of this article. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-
22-2025)
10-10C-8: EXEMPTED BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES OR USES:
When a lawfully existing building or other structure otherwise conforms to the
use regulations of this zoning ordinance, but is nonconforming only in the
particular manner hereinafter specified, the building and use shall be exempt
from the requirements of sections
10-10C-4 and
10-10C-5 of this article.
   A.   In any R district, where a dwelling is nonconforming only as to the
number of dwelling units it contains provided no such building shall be altered
in any way as to increase the number of dwelling units therein.
   B.   In any R district, where a use permitted in the C-1 district occupies
ground floor space within a multi-family dwelling located on a corner lot.
   C.   Any single-family dwelling which became nonconforming on the effective
date hereof and is nonconforming only as to total lot area, front, side or rear
yard requirements, may be remodeled, extended or structurally altered, if in
the opinion of the zoning administrator such alteration will not adversely
affect the health, safety, value or general welfare of adjoining or neighboring
lots.
   D.   In any C or I district, where the use is less distant from an R
district than that specified in the setback regulation for the district in
which it is located.
   E.   In any district where an established building, structure or use is
nonconforming with respect to the standards prescribed in this zoning ordinance
for any of the following:
      1.   Yards - front, side or rear.
      2.   Off street parking or loading.
      3.   Gross floor area.
   F.   In any AG-1 district where an established nonfarm dwelling was located
on or before the effective date hereof, it shall be deemed a legal use.
   G.   A lot which was established in an agricultural district by recorded
deed or subdivision plat, or was otherwise legally established on or before the
adoption hereof may be used for single-family residential purposes provided
that the yard requirements of the R-1 district are complied with. (Ord. 2025-

would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces located together
shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements for each use.
   C.   Computation: When the required number of off street parking spaces
results in a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half (1/2) shall
be disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as
one parking space.
   D.   Open And Enclosed Parking Spaces: Accessory parking spaces may be open

temporary or special use permit in any residential district within two hundred
feet (200') of and adjacent to any office, commercial or industrial use. (Ord.
06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-11-4: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Scope Of Regulations: The off street parking and loading provisions
shall apply as follows:
      1.   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of property
established after the effective date hereof, accessory parking and loading
facilities shall be provided as required herein or in section
10-11-1 of this chapter.
      2.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity (eighteen (18) inches per seat), or other units of measurement
specified herein, additional parking or loading facilities as required herein
shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
      3.   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter
be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use.
      4.   If the building or structure was constructed, or the use was in
effect, prior to the effective date hereof, additional parking or loading
facilities required under sections
10-11-2 and
10-11-3 of this chapter shall only be required to the extent that such
additional requirements exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the parking and loading
requirements in effect as of the effective date hereof.
   B.   Existing Parking And Loading Facilities: Accessory off street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served, and which were in existence on the effective date hereof, or were
provided voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be reduced
below, or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below, the
requirements of this zoning ordinance for a similar new building or use.
   C.   Permissive Parking And Loading Facilities: The voluntary establishment
of off street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of
property or buildings is encouraged, provided that all regulations set out in
this title or title 11 of this code governing the location, design, improvement
and operation of such facilities are adhered to.
   D.   Damage And Destruction: For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date hereof, which
subsequent hereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other
cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off street
parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking or
loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. In no case, however,
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this title for equivalent new construction or a new
use.
   E.   Control Of Off Site Parking Facilities: When required parking
facilities are provided on property other than the lot on which the building or
use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the same
ownership or possession as the lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. No such off site parking facilities shall be
authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued for any building or
structural alteration where the plans call for parking other than on the same
lot until and unless the zoning hearing officer has reviewed the plans, held a
hearing and has made findings that the common ownership or possession of the
lot, and that the site of the parking facilities, are reasonably certain to
continue, and that the off site parking facilities will be maintained, at all
times during the life of the proposed building or use.
   F.   Submission Of Sketch Plan: Any application for a building permit, or
for a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required, shall
include therewith a sketch plan (drawn to scale and fully dimensioned)
depicting any parking or loading facilities provided in compliance with this
title and title 11 of this code. Any such sketch plan shall indicate access to
the area and traffic patterns in the adjoining roadways and alleys. (Ord. 06-
05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)

administrator on such forms and for such fees as are published in the "county
development manual" from time to time, prior to installation of a sign or
modification of an existing sign face or sign structure. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-
2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)
10-12-4: PERMIT GRANTING, ISSUANCE AND REVOCATION:
   A.   All sign permit applications shall be reviewed by the zoning
administrator, who shall deny or grant such applications. Upon granting, the
zoning administrator shall issue the sign permit.
   B.   No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be deemed to constitute
permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign nor shall any permit
issued hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful sign.

void and automatically revoked in the event that construction, installation or
manufacture of the sign has not been commenced within one hundred eighty (180)
days from the date of the issuance of such permit. If work authorized by such
permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of ninety (90) days any time
after the work is commenced, the original permit shall become null and void.
Thereafter, a new permit shall be obtained to complete the work, and a new
permit fee shall be required.
   D.   Revocation shall not give cause to a right of total or partial
reimbursement of permit fees paid.
   E.   Appeals may be taken from any determination of the zoning administrator
pursuant to subsections
10-2B-2A and B of this title. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-

have the authority to order the repair or removal of any sign which is
defective, which is an illegal nonconforming sign, or which has been erected,
installed, constructed, modified or maintained in violation of this chapter so
as to constitute a nuisance or be dangerous to the public health and safety. In
the event the person so notified should fail to comply with such an order
within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice, that person will be subject
to the penalties set out in subsections
10-2A-5A and/or B of this title.
   B.   The zoning administrator shall cause to be removed any sign that
endangers the public health or safety, extends or projects into any public

event of removal of a sign by the county, the owner of the sign or building or
lot upon which the sign is located may be charged for the cost of removing such
sign. Removal of a sign shall only take place after at least a five (5) day
written notice stating the reasons for said violation or removal. Said notice
shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected
within said five (5) day or other notice period, the sign shall be removed in
accordance with the provisions of this subsection. All notices mailed by the
zoning administrator shall be mailed to the owner of the lot on which the sign
is located, to the owner of the sign and to the occupant of the lot, if any, if
the identity and whereabouts of such persons can be determined. Otherwise,
notice shall be mailed to such persons at the last known address and posted on
the sign, on the building, on the lot or published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006,

located thereon any sign for the purpose of providing advertisement of products
or devices or directing people to a business activity located on the lot or off
the lot. Licensed business vehicles containing typical business signage,
actively used on a daily basis for business purposes, are exempt from this
prohibition.
   G.   No person shall erect, construct, or maintain any sign upon any lot or
building without the express consent of the owner or person entitled to
possession of the lot or building or their authorized representative. (Ord. 06-
05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-22-2025)

including the supports of monument signs not used for copy, shall not be
counted as a part of the sign's message. Where a freestanding sign has two (2)
or more display faces, the total area of all of the display faces which can be
viewed from any single location shall be considered the sign face area.
   B.   In the case of a sign whose message is fabricated (such as an awning
sign or canopy sign) together with the background which borders or frames that
message, sign face area shall be the total area of the entire background.
   C.   In the case of a sign whose message is applied to a background, which

CHAPTER 13
LANDSCAPING
SECTION:
10-13-1: Purpose
10-13-2: Development Standards
10-13-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for the use of
landscaping for properties located in the county which are undergoing
development, to promote a functional and attractive development, to minimize
adverse impacts from adjoining properties and to ensure that properties are
developed in accordance with plans previously approved by the county board or
other county authority. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-05-006, 5-
22-2025)
10-13-2: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The following landscaping standards shall apply to all development requiring a
building permit, plan approval or other type of permit under this title or
title 11 of this code:
   A.   Preserve Existing Natural Elements:
      1.   Each development application, or building permit application shall
be accompanied by a preliminary analysis of the lot or property describing:
topography, existing vegetation, existing buildings or other structures,
adjoining roadways, public or private, visual features and a description of the
property's current use.
      2.   Development plans shall minimize impact on existing natural
features, and where possible incorporate such natural features into the plan.
      3.   Construction activities, where possible, shall be restricted to
those portions of the site, which shall be identified and staked, and that do
not disrupt natural features and the drip lines of mature trees.
      4.   No development shall occur in "wetlands" and/or SFHAs as defined in
title 11 of this code unless the provisions of said title are complied with.
Such areas shall remain undeveloped where possible.
      5.   Trees with a caliper measurement of six inches (6") or more or
groves of trees shall be developed around where possible. Variations in bulk
regulations and other landscaping requirements will be considered to preserve
such natural features.
      6.   Development on steep slopes and over highly erodible soils should be
discouraged, and adherence to the county greenways plan should be encouraged in
the placement of pathways and the preservation of animal migratory patterns.
      7.   The storm water management provisions of title 11 of this code shall
be applied in every development.
   B.   Site Landscape Standard:
      1.   A landscape plan for all developments, buildings or alterations
requiring a building or development permit shall be required.
      2.   The landscape plan shall comply with all of the requirements set out
in the "county development manual".
      3.   A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of total land area of the
development site shall be devoted to landscaped open space. Standards shall be
relaxed on a site specific basis when dealing with sites which are already
partly or completely developed. Particular standard deviation should be
permitted where the developer has retained significant natural features or
designed in accommodation with the county greenways plan.
   C.   Types Of Landscaped Areas: Plantings are ordinarily required in four
(4) distinct areas of a lot or property. These areas are: interior parkways;
buffer yard areas; parking lots; site interiors. Parking lot landscaping is
addressed in section
10-11-1 of this title. The standards set out herein may be relaxed where
appropriate, or duplicative of requirements specified elsewhere.
      1.   Interior parkway plantings are required of new developments in order
to screen vehicles visible to public roadways and to enhance the rural
character of the county along roadway corridors. In single-family residential
districts the type and density of interior parkway plantings shall be in
keeping with the surrounding environment of the development.
         a.   In mixed and multiple-family residential districts there shall

will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare;
         b.   The WECS project will not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values of surrounding
properties;
         c.   The establishment of the WECS project will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding properties;
         d.   Adequate public utilities, access roads, drainage and/or
necessary facilities have been or will be provided;
         e.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;

on a leased portion of a larger lot owned by someone other than the tower
owner, setbacks shall be measured from the boundaries of such larger lot:
      1.   Communication towers must be set back from all property lines by a
minimum distance of one hundred percent (100%) of the height of the tower plus
twenty five feet (25');
      2.   No setbacks shall be required if the antenna is to be located on an
existing structure.
   F.   Structure Safety: The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed
communications tower and antenna are safe and the surrounding areas will not be
negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice or other debris,
electromagnetic fields, or radio frequency interference. All communication
towers shall be fitted with anticlimbing devices, as approved by the

   G.   Separation From Other Communications Towers: A separation of one
thousand five hundred feet (1,500') shall be maintained between communications
towers (measured by drawing a straight line between the base of the existing
tower and the base of the proposed tower as shown on the site plan).
Separations of less than one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') shall require
a special use permit. In no case will communications towers be located closer
than five hundred feet (500') apart.
   H.   Fencing: A fence of not less than eight feet (8') in height shall be
required around the base of the communication tower. The fence shall enclose
any uses ancillary to the communications tower. A fence or other approved

communications towers shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish in
order to reduce the visual impact. Alternate colors may be required to minimize
visual impact in residential or commercial districts.
   K.   Lighting: No communications towers shall be artificially lighted except
when required by the FAA. If lighting is required, dual mode lighting
(intermittent red lighting for nighttime use and high intensity lighting for
daytime use) shall be installed unless dual mode lighting is specifically
denied by the FAA. Security lighting is permitted at ground level. All lighting
shall be designed so as not to project onto surrounding residential property.
   L.   Advertising: No commercial advertising or signs shall be allowed on
communications towers.
   M.   Residential Districts: A special use permit shall be required for any
communication tower located in residential districts. Communications equipment
should be attached to existing poles and/or structures wherever possible.

10-15-21: SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AS AN ACCESSORY USE:
The purpose of this ordinance is to facilitate the construction, installation,
and operation of solar energy systems as an accessory use in Lee County that
promotes the right to clean energy and access to solar power; and ensures the
protection of public health, safety, and welfare by encouraging the development
and use of solar energy systems in order to conserve and protect the value of
land, buildings, and resources by preventing the adoption of measures which
will have the ultimate effect, however unintended, of preventing the use of
solar energy systems on any home that is subject to a homeowners' association,
common interest community association, or condominium unit owners' association.

   A.   Each person, firm or corporation to whom a special use permit to mine
is issued may engage in mining upon the lands described in the special use
permit, subject to the following regulations:
      1.   The mining operations shall be conducted in compliance with the laws
of the state and federal government especially as related to safety standards,
and ordinances and resolutions of the county, as amended from time to time and
in compliance with a furtherance of the approved reclamation plan for the land
subject to the special use permit.
      2.   Clearing of the mining site shall include the moving of existing
trees and shrubs to such locations as will provide screening as hereinafter
provided whenever possible or as will conform to the plan for ultimate use of
the property as shown on the reclamation plan to be submitted.
      3.   Maximum depth of excavation shall not be below existing ground
water, except in such cases where the reclamation plan indicates that a lake or
lakes will be part of the final use of the land or where such plan indicates
that adequate fill from overburden is to be used to refill such excavation for
conformance to the approved reclamation plan.
      4.   Adequate planting including native species and/or fencing shall be
provided along all public roads adjacent to the property involved, sufficient
to screen the operation from public view, as shown on approved reclamation and
landscape plans and as approved by the county board in granting the special use
permit.
      5.   Not more than one entrance and one exit from a roadway shall be
provided to the area of operation. Such entrance shall be subject to approval
by the highway department having jurisdiction of the roadway and shall
preferably be located along a secondary roadway, and shall be located as to
avoid the routing of vehicles to and from the mining operation over streets
that primarily serve abutting residential development. If required by the
highway department having jurisdiction, acceleration and deceleration strips
shall be provided on either side of such entrance and exit, each not less than
one hundred feet (100') in length, and shall be paved of such material as shall
be required by the highway department having jurisdiction. Furthermore, a paved
roadway from the entrance and exit, a distance of not less than three hundred
feet (300') from the right of way line into the area of operation shall be
provided in order to minimize the deposits of dirt and gravel from trucks onto
the public roadway. Such pavement shall be in accordance with the
specifications of the county highway department. Entrances and exits shall be
provided with the gates to be securely locked during hours of operation.
      6.   Trucks used in hauling materials from the site of excavation shall
be loaded in such a manner as to prevent spillage onto the public roadway.
Hours of operation of transport vehicles shall be from six o'clock (6:00) A.M.
to seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. from April 1 until November 1. During the balance
of the year the operation of transport vehicles shall be restricted to six
o'clock (6:00) A.M. to six o'clock (6:00) P.M. Hours may be extended during a
public emergency during which sand, gravel or limestone is needed and upon the
order of the county engineer or the zoning administrator. The county board
members representing the district in which the mining operation is located
shall be notified as soon as permission is granted for extended hours of
operation.
      7.   Overburden shall not be removed in excess of the area to be mined
within one year. Reclamation and landscaping plans shall be carried on as
excavation progresses. Where ground cover or other planting is indicated on
approved plans, such planting shall be made in areas where excavation is
completed and land is not being used for material storage before further
overburden is removed and in order to ensure reclamation and development as
operations proceed.
      8.   Mining operations, not including maintenance of equipment used in
the mining operation shall be conducted only during the hours of six o'clock
(6:00) A.M. to six o'clock (6:00) P.M., except during a public emergency during
which sand and gravel is needed and upon order of the county engineer or the
zoning administrator. The county board members representing the district in
which the mining operation is located shall be notified as soon as permission
is granted for extended hours of operation.
      9.   No extraction operations shall be conducted in such a manner as to
permanently lower the water table of surrounding inhabited properties.
      10.   Where required by the county board in granting a special use permit
for a mining operation, to promote safety, a fence shall be erected which shall
be of a nature and character to protect the general public from danger.
      11.   Weeds and other unsightly or noxious vegetation shall be cut or
trimmed at least twice a year or as may be necessary to present a reasonably
neat appearance and to prevent seeding on adjoining property.
      12.   Existing trees and ground cover along public roadway frontage shall
be preserved, maintained, and supplemented for the depth of the required
roadway setback.
      13.   Upon the completion of the operations, the land shall be left in a
condition so that sufficient drainage is provided in order to prevent water
pockets or undue erosion with all grading and drainage such that natural storm
water leaves the entire property at the original, natural, drainage points and
that the area drainage to any one such point is not increased. In the event the
reclamation plan shall provide for the permanent establishment of a lake, the
grading and drainage may be altered, but not in such a manner as to cause
damage or inconvenience to surrounding or adjoining properties.
      14.   Graded or backfilled areas or banks in the cases of excavations
made to water producing depth shall be covered with topsoil to a minimum
average depth of six inches (6"). Such topsoil shall have a minimum of twenty
five percent (25%) organic material except that no greater depth of topsoil or
percentage of organic material shall be required than originally existing on
the property prior to the commencement of mining operations.
      15.   Upon replacement of the topsoil, trees, shrubs, legumes, grasses or
ground cover, native species if possible shall be planted in accordance with
the approved landscape, soil erosion control and reclamation plan.
      16.   Whenever production on any property shall have been completed, all
buildings, plants, structures (except fences) and equipment shall be entirely
removed within six (6) months after such completion, unless same are to be used
in connection with the reclamation project proposed or relative to the removal
of stored materials. Any and all stockpiled materials shall be removed in not
more than two (2) years following cessation of production and the area occupied
by such stockpiled material, or materials, shall then be restored as provided
for in the reclamation plan.
      17.   Whenever production on any property involves blasting such
operation shall be in accordance with the Illinois department of mines and
minerals regulations. In addition, these operations shall have a seismograph
located on site available to calibrate ground disturbances in close proximity
to the mining.
      18.   Concrete and asphalt may be stockpiled on the mining site for
recycling purposes only. Recycling of these materials may only be conducted in
conjunction with a licensed mining operation and in accordance with EPA
applicable regulations. Concrete and asphalt to be recycled and their
byproducts (such as, but not limited to, reinforcing bar and wire mesh), must
be properly processed and disposed of at a minimum of once per year. All
activity associated with concrete and asphalt recycling shall not be conducted
closer than two hundred feet (200') from the boundaries of an adjoining
property line. Maximum height of stockpiles shall not exceed berm heights as
approved on the reclamation map, and/or exceed the height of excavation below
grade. All recycled materials shall be certified as to origin and potential for
ground water or surface water contamination. A settling basin shall be provided
for all runoff generated from recycled materials and associated activities. A
minimum one hundred foot (100') separation from any surface waters shall be
provided from recycled materials and associated activities. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-

11-1A-3: PURPOSE, RULES AND REGULATIONS:
The purpose of this subdivision control ordinance is to promote the public
health, safety and welfare and to conserve, protect and enhance property and
property values in the county through orderly growth and development of land,
and to diminish excess storm water runoff and damages caused by erosion
throughout the county. This ordinance establishes rules and regulations for the
development, redevelopment and subdividing of land to achieve the minimum
conflict between farming and other land development, and regulates development
activity to ensure that it will not cause adverse impacts due to improper
drainage, soil erosion or inundation of properties.
These rules and regulations are specifically designed to:
   A.   Encourage the use of prime farmland for agricultural purposes by
applying the land evaluation and site assessment system (LESA) to determine
appropriate areas within the county for development;
   B.   Assure the orderly extension of public county and township roads, limit
the number and location of access roads, and discourage the construction and
continued utilization of private roads;
   C.   Prevent unwise development from increasing flood or drainage damage to
other properties due to improper building site selection and increases in storm
water runoff;
   D.   Promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the county from the hazards of flooding on a watershed basis;
   E.   Lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs
to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion
problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased storm
water runoff quantities from new development;
   F.   Preserve the natural hydrological and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats;
   G.   Permit properties in the county to qualify for federally insured
property insurance by fulfilling the requirements of the NFIP;
   H.   Diminish threats to county properties caused by excess storm water
runoff from new development and/or redevelopment;
   I.   Preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to
moderate flood and storm water adverse impacts, improve water quality, reduce
soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)

REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
SFHA: See definition of floodplain.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other
improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a
substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: See definition of "building".
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage "subsequent to the adoption of this chapter",
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed.
Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. The term
includes "repetitive loss buildings" (see definition).
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a structure taking place "subsequent to the adoption of this
chapter", in which the cumulative percentage of improvements:
   A.   Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
   B.   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
The term does not include:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required Federal, State, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 06-16-002, 6-21-2016)

or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the Countywide
Flood Insurance Rate Map of Lee County.
   C.   The base flood elevation for each of the remaining floodplains
delineated as an "A Zone" on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Lee
County shall be according to the best data available from Federal, State or
other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be
financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations. (Ord. 06-16-002,

   M.   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   N.   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 06-16-002, 6-21-2016)
11-3-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Lee County Zoning Administrator. The Lee County
Zoning Administrator shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;

   B.   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Lee County
Zoning Administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that is shown by survey elevation to
be below the current base flood elevation is subject to the provisions of this
chapter. In addition, any development located on land shown to be below the
base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but not
identified as floodplain on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to
the provisions of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and
which has not been filled after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance
Rate Map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
The Lee County Zoning Administrator shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance
Rate Map identification.
The Lee County Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other Federal, State, and local permits, approvals or
permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
Lee County Zoning Administrator shall not issue a permit unless all other
Federal, State, and local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 06-16-002, 6-21-
2016)

11-3-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Lee County Zoning Board of
Appeals for a variance. The Lee County Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
Lee County Board. The Lee County Board may attach such conditions to granting
of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   A.   Conditions: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   Risk: The Lee County Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant
in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protections
standards of section
11-3-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Historic Structures:
      1.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
11-3-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
11-3-6 and
11-3-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure, and
         b.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   D.   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and
wet-floodproofed.
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with
section
11-3-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
11-3-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. Any mechanical,
electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight,
floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood
conditions in accordance with section
11-3-7 of this chapter.
      5.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters in accordance with subsection
11-3-7B this chapter.
      6.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
11-3-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      7.   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Zoning Administrator and a registered professional engineer or
architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 06-16-002, 6-21-2016)
11-3-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the County of Lee or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 06-16-002, 6-21-2016)
11-3-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Lee County State's
Attorney may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
chapter exists. The Lee County State's Attorney shall notify the owner in
writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The County of Lee shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense;
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      4.   The County of Lee shall record a notice of violation on the title of
the property.
   B.   Lee County State's Attorney shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
The Lee County State's Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the Lee County Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Lee County Zoning Board
of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the County of Lee from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 06-16-002,
6-21-2016)
11-3-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Lee County
Board to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including: April 5, 2010. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants
or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 06-16-002, 6-21-2016)

11-4-1: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter shall apply to any new residential development having three or
more dwelling units, any development in a special flood hazard area; any new
commercial, industrial, institutional or utility developments with a proposed
impervious area greater than eleven thousand (11,000) square feet; and for any
increases of impervious parking area or conversions of gravel parking to
impervious surface at existing commercial, industrial, institutional or utility
developments. When existing development is being added to, a drainage plan for
the new development will not include the existing development as part of the
calculations. This chapter shall not apply to a single-family residence, a
solar farm where the runoff rates are being reduced from the existing
condition, exempted agricultural practices and facilities, or for developments
with impervious areas less than or equal to eleven thousand (11,000) square
feet. This chapter only applies to development, as herein defined, in the
unincorporated area of the county. When development is proposed within one and
one-half (1½) miles of an incorporated municipality, and that municipality has
adopted a storm water management ordinance or regulation, the more restrictive
shall be applied. Upon adoption of this chapter, drainage conditions in
residential, commercial, industrial zones, and AG-1 special use areas, as
defined in title 10 of this code, shall be considered established as existing
drainage conditions. Changes to these existing drainage conditions, through
development, which has an adverse effect on adjoining or neighboring
properties, shall be considered a violation of this title. The zoning
enforcement officer shall have the authority to investigate upon complaint of
any party, or on his own initiative, any changes to drainage conditions or
development where no drainage permit has previously been issued. The provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed the minimum requirements regarding storm water
drainage and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers
provided by state law. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-
2025)
11-4-2: DRAINAGE PERMIT REQUIRED:
No person, firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by state law,
shall commence any development without first obtaining a drainage permit from
the county engineer. The county engineer shall not issue a permit if the
proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter. Facilities
in existence as of the date of the adoption of this title shall not be required
to be upgraded to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Owners or
subdividers who are increasing the impervious area of the property, but are
exempt from having to obtain a drainage permit shall request the exemption, in
writing, and shall include a sketch prepared by a registered professional
engineer showing the existing impervious area and the proposed impervious area.
(Ord. 2025-03-002, 3- 3-2025)
11-4-3: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
Every application for a drainage permit shall be accompanied by a drainage plan
as required herein and such other information as may be required by the county
engineer for the proper enforcement of this chapter. Each applicant shall
submit the following information, to ensure that the provisions of this chapter
are met. The submittal shall include sufficient information to evaluate the
environmental characteristics of the property, the potential adverse impacts of
the development on water resources, both on site and downstream, and the
effectiveness of the proposed drainage plan in managing storm water runoff. The
applicant shall certify on the drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage
and construction shall be accomplished in strict conformance with the drainage
plan. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-4: SUBMITTALS:
The drainage plan shall identify means for controlling the storm water release
rate from the development and providing storage potential for the excess storm
water runoff (where required). All computations, plans and specifications
related to the implementation of this chapter must be prepared and sealed by a
professional engineer, registered in Illinois. The storm water management plan
shall contain, but not be limited to, the following information, unless
specifically waived by the county engineer:
   A.   A topographic map of the project site and the surrounding areas, of
suitable scale and contour interval, which shall define the location of
streams, the extent of floodplain and calculated high water elevations, the
shoreline of lakes, ponds, swamps and detention basins including their inflow
and outflow structures, if any.
   B.   The location and flow line elevation of all existing sanitary, storm or
combined sewers.
   C.    Detailed determination of runoff anticipated for the entire project
site following development, indicating design volumes and rates of proposed
runoff for each portion of the tributary watershed to the storm water drainage
system, the calculations used to determine said runoff volumes and rates, and
restatement of the criteria which have been used by the project engineer
throughout his/her calculations.
   D.   A layout of the proposed storm water management system including the
location and size of all drainage structures, storm sewers, channels and
channel sections, detention basins and analyses regarding the effect said
improvements shall have upon the receiving channel and its high water surface
elevation.
   E.   The slope, type and size of all existing and proposed storm sewers and
other waterways.
   F.   For all storm water management facilities, a plot or tabulation of

   G.   An erosion and sedimentation control plan showing:
      1.   All erosion and sedimentation control measures necessary to meet the
objectives of this title and the national pollutant discharge elimination
system (NPDES) throughout all phases of construction and permanently after
completion of development of the site.
      2.   Provisions for maintenance of temporary and permanent control
facilities, including easements.
      3.   Identification of the person(s) or entity which shall have legal and
financial responsibility for maintenance of permanent, erosion control
structures and measures after development is completed, and such identification
and/or any subsequent changes thereto should be provided to the county
engineer. Provisions shall be made to revise this information, upon any change
in related ownership and/or cited responsibility.
   H.   A reference elevation bench mark and flood protection elevation shall
be established in the near vicinity to the storm water management facility and
shall be referenced on the plan. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-
002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-5: DESIGN CRITERIA/GUIDELINES:
   A.   Twelve (12) Release Rates: The drainage system for a property shall be
designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the two
(2) year, twenty-four (24) hour and one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24)
hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel
instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed
properties and downstream drainage capacities. The post-development peak
discharge shall not exceed the pre-development peak discharge.
      In the event the natural downstream channel or sewer system is inadequate
to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the allowable release rate
shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the downstream
channel or storm sewer system.
   B.   Detention: The increased storm water runoff resulting from the proposed
development may be accommodated by the provision of appropriate storm water
management facilities including wet or dry bottom reservoirs, parking lots,
natural depressions in the landscape or similar. The following shall govern the
design of storm water management facilities:
      1.   Storage Volume: The volume of storage potential provided in storm
water management facilities shall be sufficient to control the excess storm
water runoff, as determined to be the difference between the storm water
quantity from the site in its developed state for a one hundred (100) year
event frequency rainfall as published by the Illinois state water survey in
bulletin 70, or subsequent updates, less the allowable storm water release rate
as set forth in subsection A of this section.
      2.   Release Rate: At no time during the design storm shall the storm
water runoff release rate exceed the allowable release rate set forth in
subsection A of this section. Backwater on the outlet structure from the
downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet.
      3.   Release Velocity: Detention facilities shall release storm water
into any unprotected channel at a nonerosive velocity of three feet (3') per
second or less. Protected channels receiving detention discharge shall
incorporate features to reduce velocity to the above prescribed nonerosive
levels at the point where such discharge enters the unprotected channel. If
release is into a subsurface conduit, the energy gradient in the receiving
facility shall not be increased beyond the slope of the conduit.
      4.   Spillway: Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit safe
passage of runoff generated from a storm in excess of a one hundred (100) year
event frequency.
      5.   Freeboard: Detention facilities shall have adequate capacity to
contain the storage volume of tributary storm water runoff with at least one
foot (1') of freeboard above the water surface of flow in the emergency
spillway in a one hundred (100) year event.
   C.   Methods Of Determining Storm Water Runoff Rate And Volume: Drainage and
storage facilities may be designated using the "rational" method of calculating
runoff, discharge rate and total volume (see storm water runoff coefficients on
file in the county planning office and incorporated herein by reference) for
parcels twenty (20) acres or less. The natural resource conservation service
(NRCS) method (TR20 or TR55) may be used for any parcel but is required for
parcels over twenty (20) acres.
   D.   Development Design: Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public
grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to minimize the
velocity of overland flow and to allow maximum opportunity for infiltration of
storm water into the ground, and to preserve and utilize existing and planned
streams, channels and storm water management facilities, and to include
whenever possible, streams and floodplains within parks and other public
grounds. Whenever practicable, areas of the property must be provided an
overland flow path that will pass the one hundred (100) year flow at a stage at
least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the
flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor
drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding
and flow depths shall not exceed curb height by more than one inch (1").
   E.   Methods For Generating Runoff Hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs shall be
developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and
antecedent moisture. Acceptable runoff hydrograph calculation methods would
include, but not necessarily be limited to, HEC-1, SCS TR20, SCS TR55 Tabular
Method, etc.
   F.   Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system
hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois
state water survey's bulletin 70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as
an alternate to the Huff distributions and shall be used for the hydrograph
design methods.
   G.   Antecedent Moisture: Computation of runoff hydrographs, which do not
rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume
a antecedent moisture condition II.
   H.   Infiltration Practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes,
infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement should
be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups "A" or B as designated by the
U.S. soil conservation service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to
recharge ground water shall not be located within seventy five feet (75') of a
water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be
provided to remove coarse sediment from storm water flows before they reach
infiltration basins or trenches. Storm water shall not be allowed to stand more
than forty eight (48) hours over eighty percent (80%) of a dry basin's bottom
area for the maximum design event to be exfiltrated. The bottom of infiltration
facilities shall be a minimum of four feet (4') above seasonally high ground
water and bedrock.
   I.   Vegetated Filter Strips And Swales: To effectively filter storm water
pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to
maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. Wherever practicable,
runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter strips and
swales before being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin.
   J.   Safety Considerations: The drainage system component, especially all
detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or
adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
   K.   Velocity: Velocities throughout the drainage system shall be controlled
to safe and nonerosive levels taking into consideration rate and depth of flow.
   L.   Maintenance Considerations: The storm water drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be
designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins
shall be provided with alternate outflows that can be used to completely drain
the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by
gravity is not feasible.) Presedimentation basins shall be included, where
feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access and access
easements for heavy equipment shall be provided. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005;
amd. Ord. 2025- 03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-6: DETENTION BASINS:
   A.   Wet Detention Basin Design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to
remove storm water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as
much as feasible to be available for recreational use.
   B.   Wet Basin Depths: Wet basins shall be at least five feet (5') deep,
excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided
they shall be at least ten feet (10') deep over twenty five percent (25%) of
the bottom area to prevent winter freeze out.
   C.   Wet Basin Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins above the
normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than four to one (4:1) (horizontal
to vertical).
   D.   Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to or greater than the runoff volume from its
watershed for the two (2) year event.
   E.   Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they
should be at opposite ends of the basin. There should be no low flow bypass
between the inlet and outlet and paved low flow channels shall not be used.
   F.   Wet And Dry Detention Basin Design: In addition to the other
requirements of this title, wet and dry basins shall be designed to remove
storm water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as
feasible, to be available for multiple uses.
   G.   Wet And Dry Basin Drainage: Wet/wetland and dry basins shall be
designed so eighty percent (80%) of their bottom area which is intended to be
dry shall have standing water no longer than seventy two (72) hours for any
runoff event less than the one hundred (100) year event. Underdrains directed
to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. Grading plans shall
clearly distinguish the wet/wetland portion of the basin bottom from the dry
portion. Ground slopes in the dry portions of detention basins shall be one
point five (1.5) percent or steeper slope. If a concrete swale is installed at
the bottom of the pond the slope may be a minimum of zero and a half (0.5)
percent.
   H.   Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlet and outlets
and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.
   I.   Stilling/Sedimentation Basins: A temporary stilling/sedimentation basin
should be constructed at each major inlet to a wetland or dry basin. The volume
of the basins should be at least five hundred feet (500') per acre of
impervious surface in the drainage area. Side slopes of the basins shall be no
steeper than three (3) horizontal to one vertical, and basin depths should be
at least three feet (3') to minimize resuspension of accumulated sediment. A
detention facility may be utilized as a temporary stilling/sedimentation basin
for its drainage area. The required detention volume must be maintained at all
times.
   J.   Minimum Detention Outlet Size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice
plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of
six inches (3"). If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater
than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical
alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate
self-cleaning flow restrictors.
   K.   Detention In Floodplains: The placement of detention basins in
floodplains is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable
operation during flood events. However, the storm water detention requirements
of this title may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood
fringe areas on the project site, providing the following provisions are met:
      1.   Detention In Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for one and a half
(1.5) times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention
basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided
shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The
applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all stream flow and floodplain
backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses
shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain
storage lost above the existing ten (10) year flood elevation shall be replaced
above the proposed ten (10) year flood elevation. All compensatory storage
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
      2.   Detention On Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with subsection K3 of this section.
      3.   On-Stream Detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this title with respect to water quality and control of the five
(5) year and one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour events from the
property. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one (1)
square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling to
demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties upstream
or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-
stream detention:
         a.   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which
require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as spawning;
         b.   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality
or stream aquatic habitat;
         c.   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin;
         d.   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands;
         e.   Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source
management program throughout the upstream watershed which shall include at a
minimum: runoff reduction BMPs consistent with subsection
11-4-5C of this chapter; two (2) year detention/sedimentation basins for all
development consistent with subsection I of this section; and a program to
control nonpoint sources at the source for prior development constructed
without appropriate BMPs;
         f.   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and
         g.   Shall comply with 92 Illinois administrative code parts 702 and
708 and the requirements of chapter 3 of this title.
   L.   Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at one hundred
(100) year capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental
falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of
detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than four to one (4:1)
(horizontal to vertical). See subsection C of this section for wet bottom
facility side slopes.
   M.   Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge
at least four feet (4') in width and two and one-half (21/2) to three feet (3')
below the normal water depth.
   N.   Overflow Structures: All storm water detention basins shall be provided
with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at
least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the
detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
equivalent to the one hundred (100) year inflow rate. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-
2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-7: WETLAND CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   Protection Of Wetlands And Other Depressional Storage Areas: Wetlands
and other depressional storage areas shall be protected from damaging
modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with land development. In addition to the other requirements of this title, the
following requirements shall be met for all development where drainage flows
into wetlands and other depressional storage areas (as appropriate):
      1.   Detention In Wetlands And Depressional Storage Areas: Existing
wetlands shall not be modified for the purpose of storm water detention unless
it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed
modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform
beneficial functions. Existing storage and release rate characteristics of
wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the
volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section
shall be in addition to this existing storage.
      2.   Sediment Control: The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures, and
shall not be filled.
      3.   Alteration Of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be
altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
the wetland.
      4.   Detention/Sedimentation: All runoff from development shall be routed
through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two
(2) year, twenty-four (24) hour event and hold it for at least twenty four (24)
hours, before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed
prior to when property grading begins. In addition the drainage hierarchy
defined in subsection 11-4-6I of this chapter should be followed to minimize
runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland.
      5.   Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet
(25') in width, vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or
restored around the periphery of the wetland. No development, with the
exception of recreational trails or greenways, shall take place within the
buffer strip. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-8: STREET, PARKING LOT AND CULVERT DRAINAGE:
   A.   Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major
drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one
inch (1") and shall not remain flooded for more than four (4) hours for any
event less than or equal to the one hundred (100) year event.
   B.   Parking Lots: The maximum storm water ponding depth in any parking area
shall not exceed six inches (6") for more than four (4) hours. All parking lots
four thousand (4,000) square feet or larger shall be internally drained with
catch basins connected to a central drainage system or municipal storm sewer.
   C.   Culvert, Road And Driveway Crossings: Size of culvert crossings shall
consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the
culvert. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-9: EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL:
Measures taken to control erosion and sedimentation should be adequate to
assure that sediment is not transported from the site. The following principles
shall apply to all commercial, industrial and subdivision developments covered
by this title:
   A.   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes, where
high cuts and fills may be required, should be avoided whenever possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   B.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected whenever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed
whenever possible.
   C.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   D.   Sediment Basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps, filters
or other appropriate measures should be installed and maintained to remove
sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development.
   E.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   F.   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
of discharges shall not create additional erosion.
   G.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-
002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-10: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   Storm Water Channel Location: Generally acceptable locations of storm
water channels in the design of a subdivision may include, but are not limited
to, the following:
      1.   Adjacent to roadways.
      2.   In a depressed median of double roadway, street or parkway provided
the median is wide enough to permit slopes of one foot (1') drop in six feet
(6') horizontal or flatter.
      3.   Centered on lot lines or entirely within rear yards of a single row
of lots or parcels.
      4.   In each of the foregoing cases, a drainage easement with sufficient
width to facilitate maintenance and design flow shall be provided and shown on
the plat.
   B.   Storm Sewer Outfall: The storm sewer outfall (when present) shall be
designed to provide adequate protection against downstream erosion and scoring.
   C.   Lot Lines: Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of
storm water runoff along lot lines, the grading of all such lots shall be
prescribed and established for the passage and/or storage of waters, and no
structure or vegetation which would obstruct the flow of storm water shall be
allowed, nor shall any change be made to the prescribed grades and contours of
the specified storm water channels. Drainage easements shall be placed upon the
final plat as required in subsection
11-2-4B of this title.
   D.   Manholes: All utility sewer manholes constructed in an area designed
for the storage or passage of storm water, shall be provided with either a
watertight manhole and manhole cover or a watertight manhole with a rim
elevation of a minimum of one foot (1') above the high water elevation of the
design storm.
   E.   Obstruction Of Drainage: The keeping or disposal of grass clippings,
trash, debris, obstructions (including, but not limited to, fences,
landscaping, etc.) or unwanted materials into the storm sewers or within or
along storm water channels, and easements is prohibited and the easements and/
or covenant on any final plat shall so provide.
   F.   Maintenance: Provisions acceptable to the county for perpetual
maintenance of detention facilities, outlet works and appurtenances shall be
made as provided in section
11-4-15 of this chapter. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-
3-2025)
11-4-11: RUNOFF VOLUMES AND RATES:
In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall
evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features that minimize
the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's
drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features that
are consistent with the following hierarchy:
   A.   Minimize impervious surfaces on the property, consistent with the needs
of the project and current development regulations;
   B.   Attenuate flows by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions
and preserve existing natural stream channels;
   C.   Infiltrate runoff on site;
   D.   Provide storm water retention structures;
   E.   Construct storm sewers. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-
002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-12: WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES:
The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse impacts downstream
and on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features
to capture storm water runoff pollutants. In particular, designers should give
preference to wet bottom and wetlands designs and all flow from the development
shall be routed through a basin (i.e., low flows shall not be bypassed).
Retention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout the
property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and to
reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. The storm water drainage system
should incorporate multiple uses considered compatible with storm water
management where practicable. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-
002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-13: EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES:
Where detention, retention or depression storage areas are to be used as part
of the storm water drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as
the first element of the initial earthwork program. The applicant, before
project completion, shall remove any eroded sediment captured in these
facilities in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. The bottom
and inside slopes of detention ponds shall be seeded with a seed mixture which
is tolerant to wetland conditions. The proposed type and rate of application of
the seeding shall be included with the application. Vegetation shall be
established to a minimum height of four inches (4"). (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-
2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-14: FEES IN LIEU OF DETENTION:
All single-family residential developments under five (5) acres in size and all
other development under one acre in size shall pay a fee of twelve thousand
dollars ($12,000.00) for each acre-foot in detention which would be required
under this title rather than installing detention facilities on property when
physical limitations exist that preclude the owner from constructing such
facilities. The county shall also have the option for the development of larger
properties of requiring a fee of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) for each
acre-foot of detention needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin on site
provided the property will discharge storm water to the county's, city's or
village's storm sewer system. In instances where regional benefits and
economies of scale can be achieved, it will be permissible for adjacent
properties to utilize a common regional detention basin. Applicants shall have
the option of paying a fee to the county of twelve thousand dollars
($12,000.00) for each acre-foot of detention required, with the approval of the
county engineer, so that the county can construct regional facilities, or the
applicant and adjoining property owners can jointly construct the facilities
themselves. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-15: MAINTENANCE OF STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES:
Maintenance of storm water management facilities located on private property
shall be the responsibility of the owners or developers of the development.
Prior to a zoning certificate or building permit being issued by the zoning
administrator the applicant, owner and/or developer shall execute a storm water
management facilities maintenance agreement, in form satisfactory to the county
engineer. Said agreement shall:
   A.   Guarantee that the applicant and all further owners of the properties
involved shall defray the costs to maintain all portions of the storm water
management facility which lies on said property or properties. For developments
containing more than one property, the maintenance agreement shall provide for
some form of property owners' association which shall take care of future
maintenance needs; and
   B.   Include a schedule of regular inspections/and or maintenance, as
required, for each aspect of the storm water management facility; and
   C.   Specifically authorize representatives of the county to enter onto the
property for the purpose of periodic routine inspections of the drainage system
at least once a year and to hold harmless any county inspectors from any damage
to the drainage system or the property caused during said routine inspections;
and
   D.   Stipulate that when the county engineer determines that storm water
management facilities require maintenance and notifies the property owner,
developer and/or property owners' association in writing, either that:
      1.   The property owner, property owners' association or developer shall
begin to take remedial maintenance action within thirty (30) days of the date
of the written notification; or
      2.   The county shall initiate judicial action, to require the necessary
remedial maintenance action at the property owner's/property owners'
association, or developer's expense; and
   E.   Be recorded at owner's/developer's expense along with, or as a part of,
any final subdivision plat or development plan. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005;
amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-16: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Inspections During Construction: General site grading shall not
commence until the county engineer has certified in writing to the applicant
that any necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. A
professional engineer, hired by the developer, shall be responsible for
determining if the drainage system is in conformance with this chapter and if
the development is proceeding in accordance with the approved drainage system.
Periodic inspection of the development site shall be made by the developer's
engineer to ensure that the drainage system is properly implemented.
      The county engineer or his duly authorized representative will also
conduct periodic inspection of the work in progress to ascertain that the
drainage system is being constructed as designed. If any violations of the
provisions of this title are noted during such inspections the county engineer
shall notify the applicant in writing of the items needing remediation. The
applicant shall have ten (10) days to undertake corrective action unless given
a specific extension of time in writing by the county engineer. Failure to
remediate the violations within said time period shall constitute a violation
of this title and may be considered a default in any surety agreement
maintained with the county regarding the subdivision or development.
   B.   Final Inspections: Upon notification by the applicant that the drainage
system has been completed, the county engineer or his duly appointed
representative shall conduct a final inspection. If the drainage system is
found to be defective so as to require correction, the county engineer or his
duly appointed representative shall notify the applicant of the remedial action
required. The defects shall be corrected within ten (10) days of the receipt of
notice from the county engineer, unless the county engineer extends such time
period in writing to another specific date. Failure to take such remedial
action within the time period specified shall constitute a violation of this
title. Upon finding that the drainage system meets the provisions and
requirements of this title the county engineer shall issue a certificate of
drainage system completion to the applicant. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd.
Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-2025)
11-4-17: FINAL APPROVAL:
Upon completion of the storm water management project, the owner's/developer's
engineer and the county engineer shall affix their signatures to a set of the
storm water management plans that have been annotated to indicate any approved
changes made to the plans during construction. This set of plans will
constitute the final storm water management plans for the project, will be
referred to for future determinations regarding maintenance needs and retained
among the permanent records of the county engineer as required by section 11-
1C-3 of this title. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005; amd. Ord. 2025-03-002, 3-3-
2025)

LESA
SECTION:
11-5-1: Public Policy
11-5-2: LESA Standards
11-5-3: LESA Report Applications
11-5-1: PUBLIC POLICY:
It is the policy of the county to preserve prime farmland for agricultural
purposes and to discourage the random development of farmland for residential
or other nonagricultural purposes unless serviced by a public sewer system, or
unless located in areas away from prime farming areas or unless required for
the farm residence of the farmer, or family thereof, actively farming the
property on which the farm residence is to be constructed, and where no other
farm housing is available. To achieve these ends the county has adopted the
land evaluation and site assessment system (LESA) and applies the standards
adopted by the county board and approved by the Illinois department of
agriculture and the U.S. department of agriculture's natural resources
conservation service to determine which land is most suitable for agricultural
purposes. (See soil survey classifications on file in the county planning
office and incorporated herein by reference.) The zoning administrator and the
soil and water conservation district are charged with the duty of applying the
standards to evaluate all applications or building permits, where the property
has not previously been classified residential, all requests for residential
zoning in agricultural districts, all requests for the subdivision of property
into one or more lots of less than five (5) acres and all development
applications of property, or any part thereof, in an agricultural district
unless such development is specifically permitted by title 10 of this code or
exempt under state law. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-5-2: LESA STANDARDS:
The zoning administrator shall not grant a building permit, subdivision
approval, development permit, rezoning, special use, variation or change of
building use to a nonagricultural use in an agricultural district unless the
total LESA score is less than two hundred twenty five (225), or such other
number which the county board shall set from time to time, as determined in
accordance with the county site assessment factors on file in the county
planning office and incorporated herein by reference. LESA scores may be
appealed to the planning commission in such manner as is set out herein. Lesa
decisions of the planning commission may be further appealed to the county
board. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-5-3: LESA REPORT APPLICATIONS:
LESA report applications and the fees therefor are included in the "County
Development Manual", and may be modified from time to time. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-

11-6-2: General Provisions
11-6-3: Subdivisions And Development
11-6-4: Flood Control
11-6-5: Storm Water Management
11-6-6: LESA Variances
11-6-1: APPLICATION:
Variances may be granted by the board of appeals, planning commission where
appropriate, from the provisions of chapters 2, "Subdivisions"; 3, "Flood
Control"; 4, "Storm Water Management"; and 5, "LESA" of this title, where the
provisions of this title place undue hardship or special circumstances upon the
applicant, or exceptional topographic or other physical conditions exist, and/
or the specific provisions of the following sections are applicable. Variances
from the rules and regulations of title 8 of this code may be granted by the
county health administrator pursuant to the provisions of section
8-2-13 of this code. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-6-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The following provisions shall be applicable to all variance requests under
this title:
   A.   A variance application relating to development and/or subdivision
requirements, or a variance application relating to any other chapter of this
title or title 8 of this code, does not constitute a variance application
relating to flood control, storm water management, LESA standards, or of any
other provisions of this title, unless separate variances are requested under
the appropriate chapter, and the planning commission, or other hearing body,
makes specific findings or imposes specific conditions relating to each such
variance request.
   B.   Neither the planning commission, nor any other hearing body, may grant
a variance of any standards imposed under this title, where the property or use
involved lies within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the boundaries of a
municipality, within or without the county, within the boundaries of an FPA, or
within a township with a township planning commission, without providing thirty
(30) days' prior written notice of the hearing on any such variance request to
the municipality, township or agency affected, and providing any such
municipality, township or agency affected an opportunity to be heard. In the
event the variance requested, if allowed, would reduce the standards imposed
below the minimum standards adopted, and in full force and effect, in any such
municipality, township or affected agency, no variance shall be granted unless
agreed to in writing by the municipality, township or agency affected.
   C.   No variances shall be granted which request relief from any applicable
state or federal regulations or which are perceived to be requested to avoid
the regulations of other governmental bodies with jurisdiction over the
property or use in question. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-6-3: SUBDIVISIONS AND DEVELOPMENT:
The planning commission may vary the general principles of design and minimum
requirements for the laying out of subdivisions in the case of a subdivision
large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood which is
to be developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan, PUD, DPA or adopts
the principles set out in the county greenways and trails plan, safeguarded by
appropriate easements, restrictions or covenants, and which in the judgment of
the planning commission, makes adequate provision for all essential community
service requirements.
   A.   In the case of a subdivision of less than five (5) lots, where said
lots are adequately served by an existing public roadway, the planning
commission may exempt the subdivider from the current standards relating to
public right of way width and roadway construction, with the approval of the
applicable township road commissioner; and
   B.   Where the subdivision is served by a private road, and the subdivider
or the adjoining property owners dedicate a right of way of sufficient width to
qualify as the required public roadway right of way, which dedications shall be
made upon the face of the subdivision plat, or separately dedicated and
recorded by all adjoining property owners at the same time as the plat is
recorded, and the subdivision plat, and/or the separate dedications contain
statements that the subdivider, property owners' association and/or all
individual adjoining property owners will maintain the roadway and will be
responsible for the costs of bringing the roadway up to public road standards
in the future, the planning commission may permit the private roadway to
service the subdivision. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-6-4: FLOOD CONTROL:
Whenever the flood control standards of this title place undue hardship on a
specific development activity, the applicant may apply to the planning
commission for a variance.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to the public health or safety,
or creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional expense for flood protection, rescue or
relief operations, policing or repairs to roadways, utilities or other public
facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP;
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   The planning commission shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of section
11-3-7 of this title that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00), or more, of insurance
coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with the knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Variances to the building protection requirements of this title
requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or alteration of a site
or building included on the National Register of Historic Places may be granted
using greater latitude than the requirements of subsection B of this section.
(Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-6-5: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT:
A variance from the stormwater management provisions of chapter 4 of this title
may be granted when it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the sketch plan
review committee, that owing to special conditions, a strict adherence to the
provisions of chapter 4 of this title shall result in unnecessary hardship, but
that the spirit and intent of chapter 4 of this title shall be observed. Cost
alone shall not be considered a basis for unnecessary hardship. The variance
procedure shall be initiated by the owner/developer seeking to develop the
property by filing a request for variance with the zoning administrator. A copy
of the request shall be forwarded to the county engineer. The sketch plan
review committee shall hear the matter at its next regular meeting provided
that all adjacent landowners, and all other affected property owners in the
same watershed, have received at least ten (10) days' prior written notice from
the zoning administrator of said hearing. The sketch plan review committee may
approve a variance, approve in part a variance, with or without conditions,
approve a compromise to the variance request, or deny the variance request in
whole. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
11-6-6: LESA VARIANCES:
A LESA score exceeding 225, or exceeding any other maximum score set by the
county board from time to time, or the denial or issuance of a building permit,
subdivision request, development permit, rezoning, variation, special use
permit or other request based upon LESA standards, may be appealed to the
planning commission by filing an application with the zoning administrator
requesting a variance or reversal from any such administrative decision of a
county official or agency. In every case the planning commission, in addition
to weighing the hardship on the applicant or the necessity of the proposed use,
shall consider foremost the effect on the reduction of prime farmland in the
county and on the surrounding agricultural uses. Only the applicant, adjoining
landowners, townships which have established township planning commissions and
municipalities within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the property affected
shall have standing to appeal a LESA determination. (Ord. 06-05-002, 6-21-2005)
