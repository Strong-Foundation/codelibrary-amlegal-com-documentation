audible signal by a peace officer directing such driver or operator to bring
his vehicle to a stop, willfully fails or refuses to obey such direction,
increases his speed, extinguishes his lights, or otherwise flees or attempts to
elude the officer (see 625 ILS 5/11-204); and
   WHEREAS, police are limited from engaging in motor vehicle pursuits related
to minor offenses, a limitation that has resulted in an increase of incidents
of fleeing and eluding peace officers in the Village; and
   WHEREAS, the investigation and prosecution of cases involving motor vehicle
fleeing and eluding require significant police resources, including but not
limited to, reviewing video and other evidence, preparing police reports,
conducting interviews and conducting internal administrative reviews, often
without any arrests for not being able to positively identify the driver of a
fleeing vehicle; and
   WHEREAS, an analysis by the Forest View Police Department has determined
that it costs the Police Department no less than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
in resources for every incident of motor vehicle fleeing and eluding; and
   WHEREAS, absent a positive identification of the driver of a motor vehicle,
the registered owner of a motor vehicle is in the best position to know who is
operating the registered owner’s motor vehicle, and to prevent the motor
vehicle from being used to flee or in an attempt to elude a peace officer; and
   WHEREAS, in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the Village’s
residents, it is necessary and desirable that, in the event drivers or
operators of a motor vehicle violate the law by fleeing or attempting to elude
a peace officer and are not able to be apprehended, a portion of the Village’s
costs related to said criminal activity shall be shifted to the registered
owner of the motor vehicle that was driven and operated to commit the criminal
offense; and
   WHEREAS, the administrative fee established for fleeing and eluding vehicles
is not calculated as a revenue generating fee, but rather is enacted only to
recover a portion of the Village Police Department’s resources expended in
connection with this criminal activity; and
   WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities of the Village of Forest View have
determined that it is necessary and in the best interests of the Village of
Forest View to establish administrative fees associated with motor vehicle used
to flee or in an attempt to elude peace officers in the Village of Forest View.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the President and Board of Trustees of the
Village of Forest View, Illinois as follows:
   Section 1.    Recitals. The foregoing recitals are adopted as express

This Chapter should be reviewed on an annual basis by the Board and all related
parties should be notified of any changes. (Ord. 99-6, 4-13-1999, eff. 4-13-
1999)
1-32-3: OBJECTIVES:
It should be noted that the foremost purpose of the Village's financial assets
is to provide sufficient cash flow to provide necessary services including, but
not limited to, police and fire protection, public works and administrative
services to the residents and business owners of the Village, pay when due
principal and interest on their debt obligations and meet financial obligations
to their employees, vendors and suppliers. Investments shall be undertaken in a
manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall
portfolio.
In this context, the Village's financial assets should be managed in a prudent
manner as it relates to such issues as expected rate of return, investment
opportunities and diversification while allowing sufficient cash flow to make
necessary payments for operating expenses such as payroll, taxes and purchase
of supplies and equipment. (Ord. 99-6, 4-13-1999, eff. 4-13-1999)
1-32-4: GOALS:
The investment portfolio of the Village shall be designed to attain a market-
average rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into
account the Village's risk constraints, the cash flow characteristics of the
portfolio and legal restrictions for return on investment. (Ord. 99-6, 4-13-
1999, eff. 4-13-1999)

through book entry at the Federal Reserve, unless physical securities are
involved.

replacement securities is equal or greater than the market value of the

1-32-11: SAFEKEEPING OF INVESTMENTS:
All investments shall be clearly held and accounted for to indicate ownership
by the Village. The Board may direct the registration of securities in their

be reviewed annually and changes made only after review by the Board, with
assistance from its consultants. It is the sole responsibility of the Board to
establish and maintain this written policy. (Ord. 99-6, 4-13-1999, eff. 4-13-

the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due

of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 00-13,
12-4-2000)
1-33-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 00-13, 12-4-2000)
1-33-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 00-13, 12-4-2000)
1-33-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of
the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was due or end of
the calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 00-13, 12-4-2000)
1-33-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of the underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 00-13, 12-4-2000)
1-33-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 00-13, 12-4-2000)
1-33-17: LIENS FOR UNPAID TAXES:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
00-13, 12-4-2000)
1-33-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling. (Ord. 00-13, 12-4-2000)

are washed, and the water supply shall be of a safe, sanitary quality and ample
in quantity for all cleaning purposes.
   (H)   Kitchen: The kitchen in all restaurant establishments shall have
adequate light and ventilation, and the air flow shall always be from the
dining room through the kitchen. The discharge from kitchen fans shall always
be through a duct to a point above the roof line to protect the occupants of
the building in which the establishment is located or of adjoining buildings
from nuisance. Ranges, refrigerators and other bulky equipment shall be so
arranged as not to obstruct the light and ventilation, and tables for clean and
dirty dishes and food shall be so arranged that the dirty dishes will be as far
removed from the food rack and clean dishes as may be possible. Ranges shall be
hooded so that the cooking odors may be effectively carried off by a stock, an
exhaust fan or a skylight immediately above. The walls and ceilings shall be in
good repair and easily cleaned. The floors and walls should be proof against
rats and vermin. Ranges, steam tables, shelves, racks, blocks, tables or other
machinery or furniture used in mixing, cutting, grinding, cooking or otherwise
preparing the foods for service shall be of such material and construction that
they may be kept scrupulously clean at all times.
   (I)   Construction Of Utensils And Equipment: All multi-use utensils, all
show and display cases or windows, counters, shelves, tables, refrigerating
equipment, sinks and other equipment used in connection with the operation of
such establishment shall be so constructed and located as to be easily cleaned,
and shall be kept in good repair. Utensils made of or plated with cadmium or
lead shall not be used. Solder containing lead may be used for jointing.
All surfaces of utensils coming in contact with food or drink shall be of
smooth construction, shall be made of not readily corrodible material and shall
be free of breaks, corrosion, open seams, cracks or chipped surfaces. This
requirement precludes the use of any type of equipment so designed as to permit
food or drink to come in contact with V-type threaded surfaces: The joint
between the moving and stationary surfaces of food equipment shall be close
fitting. All surfaces of equipment and utensils with which food or drink comes
in contact shall be easily accessible for cleaning. Tanks, kettles, large
containers and other equipment, used for the storage or preparation of liquid

Chapter or equipment having valves or pipes shall be installed unless the same
or complete drawings thereof shall have been submitted to the Health Officer
for approval prior to installation.
   (J)   Disposal Of Wastes: Every person owning or controlling any restaurant
establishment shall cause all offal, table refuse, shells and animal or
vegetable matter commonly known and described as garbage, to be placed in
proper metallic cans, which shall be practically air and water tight and easily
washable and which are covered with close-fitting lids at all times except when
opened for the deposit or removal of garbage, and shall cause all such
substances deposited in such cans or receptacles to be removed daily, or as
often as required by the Health Officer, from his premises and to be disposed
of either by burning in a properly constructed crematory which shall have been
approved by the Health Officer, or by dumping the same at any dumping ground or
place where garbage is dumped or disposed of by the Village. The removal and
disposition of such substances shall be done by such person at his own expense
solely, and in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the directions
or rules of the Health Officer relating to the disposition and removal of such
substances.
All garbage receptacles shall be washed when empty and, if necessary, treated
with a disinfectant.
   (K)   Refrigeration:
      1.   All readily perishable food or drink shall be kept at or below fifty
degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) except when being prepared or served. This shall
include all custard-filled pastries, milk and milk products, egg products,
meat, fish, shellfish, gravy, poultry stuffing, sauces, dressings and salads
containing meat, fish, eggs or milk or milk products. Raw meats should be
stored at or below forty degrees Fahrenheit (40°F).
      2.   All ice shall be of safe, sanitary quality and stored and handled in
such a manner as to prevent contamination. Water used to wash ice shall comply
with the safety standards of subsection (G) of this Section.
      3.   To prevent contamination of the refrigerator contents by possible
sewage backflow, all waste water from refrigeration equipment shall drain into
an open sink or drain, properly trapped and sewer connected; provided, that
where sewer connections are not available, clean, adequate, water tight drip
pans may be used, or the drainage is disposed of in an approved manner.
   (L)   Cleanliness Of Employees: All employees shall be clean in person and
no individual having an infectious disease in a communicable form or who is a
carrier of infectious disease, or who has diarrhea, sore throat or a
discharging or apparently infected wound, shall be employed in, or remain in a
restaurant establishment in any capacity which will require him to handle food
or handle dishes or other receptacles in which food is sold or served.
Employees preparing and handling foods shall be required to wear clean outer
garments and use hairnets, head bands or caps. Employees shall not expectorate
or use tobacco in any form in any room in which food is prepared or served. The
hands of all persons shall be kept clean while such persons are engaged in the

employee who does not prepare or serve food shall not be required to wear a cap
or other hair confiner.
   (M)   Sanitary Conditions: All restaurants shall be kept in a clean and
wholesome condition, dry and adequately ventilated so as to ensure a free
circulation of fresh air at all times.
Such places shall be kept free from rats, mice, flies and other insects and
vermin. No domestic animal shall be permitted in any such place where flour or
meal or other foodstuffs are kept or prepared.
The premises of all food establishments shall be kept clean and free of litter
or rubbish. Adequate lockers or dressing rooms shall be provided outside of the
kitchen or other food processing rooms, for employee's clothing. Soiled linens,
coats and aprons shall be kept in containers provided for this purpose in the
lockers or dressing room. None of the operations connected with a restaurant
shall be conducted in any room used as living or sleeping quarters. (Ord. 64-
101, 7-14-1964)
3-7-10: UTILITIES AND EQUIPMENT:
   (A)   Cleaning And Bactericidal Treatment Of Utilities And Equipment:
      1.   All equipment, including display cases, counters, shelves, tables,
meat blocks, refrigerators, stoves and hoods shall be kept clean and free from
dust, dirt, insects and other contaminating material.
      2.   All tablecloths, napkins and cloths used by waiters, chefs and other
employees shall be clean.
      3.   Single-service articles, such as paper cups, plates, straws, and
milk-bottle caps shall be used once only.
      4.   All multi-service eating and drinking utensils shall be thoroughly
cleaned after each usage, and all multi-use utensils used in the preparation or
serving of food and drink shall be thoroughly cleaned immediately following the
day's operation, in such manner as to be clean to the sight and touch. A
suitable detergent shall be used.
The cleaning shall be accomplished by the use of warm water, one hundred ten
degrees Fahrenheit (110°F) to one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit (120°F),
containing an adequate amount of an effective soap or detergent to remove
grease and solids. The soapy wash water shall be changed at sufficiently
frequent intervals to keep it reasonably clean. In machine washing, dishes
should be stacked in the racks or trays so as to avoid overcrowding and so as
to permit the wash and rinse waters to reach all surfaces of each article.
      5.   After cleaning, all utensils shall be effectively subjected to one
or more of the following or other equivalent bactericidal processes:
         (a)   Immersion for at least two (2) minutes in clean, hot water at a
temperature of at least one hundred seventy degrees Fahrenheit (170°F) or for
one-half (1/2) minute in boiling water. Unless actual boiling water is used a
thermometer shall be available convenient to the vat. The pouring of scalding
water over washed utensils shall not be accepted as satisfactory compliance.
Wherever practicable, bactericidal treatment shall be obtained through the use
of hot water in the manner above described. For this method of bactericidal
treatment two (2) adjacent deep sinks shall be provided and fitted with a
porcelain, metal or other impervious drainboard. After washing in the first
sink, the glasses, dishes, etc., should be placed in metal baskets and immersed
in the hot water in the second sink for the required period of time. Baskets
may be lined with wooden strips to prevent marking of the chinaware. Upon
removal from the hot water they should remain in the baskets until dry and then
be stored in such manner as not to become contaminated before again being used.
Where hot water is used for bactericidal treatment, there shall be provided a
hot water heater (preferably controlled by a thermostat) capable of maintaining
a water temperature of at least one hundred seventy degrees Fahrenheit (170°F)
in the vat at all times during work hours, and water at such temperature shall
be available at all times while utensils are being washed and given
bactericidal treatment. The heating device may be integral with the immersion
vat. Provision should be made for compensating for heat loss to the utensils,
especially when large numbers are submerged at any time.
Equipment that is too large to immerse may be treated: 1) with live steam from
a hose, in the case of equipment in which steam can be confined, 2) by boiling
water rinse, or 3) by spraying or swabbing with chlorine solution of at least
fifty (50) parts per million strength.
         (b)   Immersion for at least two (2) minutes in a lukewarm chlorine
bath containing at least fifty (50) parts per million of available chlorine.
The both should be made up at a strength of one hundred (100) parts per million
or more and shall not be used after its strength has been reduced to fifty (50)
parts per million. A test kit or test papers for checking concentration of the
chlorine solution shall be provided for use of the employees.
Where chlorine or other chemical treatment is used, a three (3) compartment vat
shall be required, the first compartment to be used for washing, the second for
plain rinsing and the third for chlorine or other chemical immersion; provided,
that for existing installations the second or rinsing compartment may be
omitted if a satisfactory rinsing or spraying device is substituted. The first
basket of utensils will remain in the chlorine bath for at least two (2)
minutes while the second basket is in the plain rinse and the third basket is
being washed. Upon removal from the chlorine bath the utensils may be rinsed in
safe running water, if desired, and allowed to dry either in the basket or
inverted on a drain shelf or tray.
Silver and silver-plated tableware should not be treated with chlorine, for
silver chlorides are formed which blacken the silver.
         (c)   Other chemical bactericides shall be applied in a manner similar
to that of chlorine in subsection (b) above.
      6.   In dishwashing machines.
         (a)   The washing period shall be at least forty (40) seconds with the
wash water temperature one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit (120°F) to one
hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140°F).
         (b)   The rinse period shall be at least twenty (20) seconds with the
rinse water temperature at one hundred seventy degrees Fahrenheit (170°F) or
higher.
Dishwashing machines must be kept clean. The pumps and the wash and rinse
sprays or jets, if any, should be so designed that a forceful stream of water
will reach all of the utensils when they are properly racked. Periodic
inspection and cleaning of wash and rinse sprays are essential to continued
satisfactory operation, and these parts of the machine should, therefore, be
readily accessible for inspection and cleaning. The wash tank water should be
changed during operation as often as is found necessary to keep it reasonably
clean. An effective concentration of detergent should be maintained at all
times.
New dishwashing machines should be provided with: 1) properly operating
automatic detergent dispensers, 2) thermostatic control of the temperature of
the wash water as well as that of the rinse water, and 3) thermometers in both
the wash and rinse water lines and in such a location as to be readily visible.
Adequate hot water heating and storage facilities are essential. These
specifications are not intended to be mandatory, but to serve as a guide.
      7.   Drying cloths, if used, shall be clean and shall be used for no
other purpose. It is recommended that whenever possible utensils be permitted
to drain dry without the use of drying cloths.
      8.   No article, polish or other substance containing any cyanide
preparation or other poisonous material shall be used for the cleansing or
polishing of utensils.
   (B)   Storage And Handling Of Utensils And Equipment:
      1.   All containers and utensils shall be stored above the floor in a
clean, dry place protected from flies, splash, dust, overhead leakage,
condensation and other contamination. Wherever practicable containers and
utensils shall be covered or inverted.
      2.   Drain racks, trays and shelves shall be made of not readily
corrodible material, and shall be kept clean.
      3.   Containers and utensils shall not be handled by the surfaces which
come in contact with food or drink. Fingers should not touch the inside
surfaces of glasses, cups, dishes, etc., nor the bowls of spoons, the tines of
forks or the blades of knives.
      4.   Paper cups, plates, straws, spoons, forks and other single service
containers and utensils shall be purchased in sanitary cartons and stored
therein in a clean, dry place until used, and after removal from the cartons
these articles shall be handled in a sanitary manner. Laundered cloths and
napkins shall be stored in a clean place until used.
      5.   Spoons, spatulas, dippers, scoops, etc., used for dispensing frozen
desserts shall be, when not in use, kept either in water maintained at one
hundred seventy degrees Fahrenheit (170°F) or in safe, running water. (Ord. 64-
101, 7-14-1964)
3-7-11: HANDLING OF SPECIFIC FOODS:
   (A)   Custard-Filled Products: All custard-filled and custard cream-filled
pastries shall be rebaked after filling at an oven temperature of at least four
hundred twenty five degrees Fahrenheit (425°F) for at least twenty (20)
minutes, and cooled to fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) or less within one hour
thereafter, or the filling shall be heated before the pastry shells are filled,
so that every particle of the custard or custard-cream mix is held at a
temperature of at least one hundred ninety degrees Fahrenheit (190°F) for at
least ten (10) minutes, and cooled either before or after filling the pastry
shells to fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) or less within one hour after
heating, and shall be maintained at that temperature until served or sold.
   (B)   Milk Products: All milk, fluid milk products, ice cream, frozen
custard, sherbet, ices and similar frozen desserts served shall be obtained
from sources approved by the Health Officer. Only Grade A pasteurized milk and
milk products shall be used.
In the case of milk drinks prepared, served or sold, the milk used shall
include the entire contents of the original container, or shall be from an
approved bulk dispenser. All milk drinks shall be mixed in a sanitary manner.
All milk and fluid milk products shall be served in the individual original
containers in which they were received from the distributor, or from a bulk
container equipped with an approved dispensing device complying with the
following specifications:
      1.   It shall comply with the requirements of subsection
3-7-9(I) of this Chapter, pertaining to the construction of utensils and
equipment.
      2.   No surface with which milk or milk products come in contact, except
the delivery orifice, while the dispenser is in use, shall be accessible to
manual contact, droplet infection, dust or flies.
      3.   All parts of the dispenser with which milk comes in contact,
including any measuring device, shall be cleaned and subjected to a
bactericidal treatment at the milk plant where filled and not at the restaurant
establishment.
      4.   The dispenser shall be filled and sealed with two (2) seals at the
milk plant in such a manner as to make it impossible to withdraw any of its
contents without breaking one seal and impossible to replace any of its

      5.   The dispensing device shall be so constructed as to automatically
mix the milk and cream thoroughly with each dispensing operation except in the
case of milk products which remain homogeneous without mixing. All milk and
milk products and cream served from dispensers shall be kept at a temperature
of fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) or less until served. In the enforcement of
this requirement the Health Officer may make an exception in the case of cream
served with coffee, cereals, etc. The Health Officer may permit the serving of
cream from the original container or from a dispenser which complies with
subsections 1 and 2 above, and which can be filled in a sanitary manner, kept
clean, and frequently subjected to bactericidal treatment.
   (C)   Shellfish: Oysters, clams and mussels shall be obtained from a source
approved by the United States Public Health Service. Shucked shellfish shall be
kept, until sold, served or used, in the containers in which they were placed
in the shucking plant.
   (D)   Pork: All food products which in whole or in part shall contain raw
pork, shall be deemed unwholesome if they have not been thoroughly cooked or
otherwise treated by the method approved by the Health Officer to ensure the
destruction of trichinae. (Ord. 64-101, 7-14-1964)
3-7-12: WHOLESOMENESS OF FOOD AND DRINK:

to bring into or keep in the same with the intention of selling, any food,
condiment, confection or drink which is unclean, unwholesome, tainted, putrid,
decayed, adulterated, poisoned, infected or in any other manner rendered unsafe
or unwholesome for human food. For the purposes of this Chapter, such food
products shall be deemed unwholesome for human food if the same have been
contaminated by flies or other insects, vermin, dust, dirt or other foreign
contamination; if they contain any poisonous or deleterious or injurious
ingredients in kind and quantities so as to render such articles injurious or
detrimental to health; or if they contain the whole or part of any uninspected

   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this Article, whether as
a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be

the Village for the Village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of
the amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village plus five percent
(5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. If the
audit indicates that the underpayment was more than three percent (3%) of the
amount remitted to the Village in a timely manner as provided in this Article,
then the telecommunications retailer shall reimburse the Village for any costs
incurred by the Village in conducting the audit. Any amounts payable to the
Village pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the Village within twenty
one (21) days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.

as a lease, rental, license or by some other term.
"Lease" or "rental" shall not be construed to include an agreement which
constitutes a bona fide conditional sale of a motor vehicle. The primary
consideration in determining whether an agreement is a conditional sale rather
than a lease or rental is whether the lessee under the agreement both is
required to make payments the sum of which is at least equal to the lessor's
cost of the motor vehicle and under the terms of the agreement, has the option
of taking title to or ownership of the motor vehicle for additional, nominal or

11-30-8, and 5/11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain the village
of Forest View's eligibility in the national flood insurance program; to
minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss
of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in
order to accomplish the following specific purposes:
   (A)   To meet the requirements of 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/18(g)
rivers, lakes and streams act;
   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the village by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance
program;
   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood
insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
   (H)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   (I)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT: "An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of
the state of Illinois", 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and
will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are
as specified in section
4-5-7-2 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
4-5-5 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank,
that is principally aboveground, including manufactured homes, prefabricated
buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days per year.
BUILDING COMMISSIONER: The person employed or retained by the village and whose
responsibilities include the administering of this chapter.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA
will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries
or floodways as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or flood
insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes
through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on
the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year
frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to
the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in velocities.
   (A)   The floodways are designated on the countywide flood insurance rate
map of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. When two (2)
floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall
prevail.
   (B)   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village of Forest View that may
be annexed into the village are not designated as rivers or streams with
identified floodways on the countywide flood insurance rate map prepared by
FEMA and dated August 19, 2008.
   (C)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated
floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located
on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation
is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:
   (A)   Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building or
any addition to a building.
   (B)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a

4-5-3: HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER:
   (A)   The building commissioner shall be responsible for fulfilling all of
the duties listed in section
4-5-4 of this chapter.
   (B)   To fulfill those duties, the building commissioner should first use
the criteria listed in section
4-5-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain.
   (C)   Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the building commissioner must determine whether the development
site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or
floodplain for which no floodway has been identified.
      1.   If the site is within a flood fringe, the building commissioner
shall require that the minimum requirements of section
4-5-6 of this chapter be met.
      2.   If the site is within a floodway, the building commissioner shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter be met.
      3.   If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the building commissioner shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
4-5-8 of this chapter be met.
   (D)   In addition, the general requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
4-5-6,
4-5-7, or
4-5-8 of this chapter.
   (E)   The building commissioner shall assure that all subdivision proposals
shall meet the requirements of section
4-5-10 of this chapter.
   (F)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the building
commissioner shall review the requirements of section
4-5-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the building
commissioner shall complete all notification requirements.
   (G)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the building commissioner may take any and all actions as
outlined in section
4-5-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-4: DUTIES OF THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER:
   (A)   Determining The Floodplain Designation:
      1.   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
      2.   If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
      3.   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA
(with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the development
would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which
would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain
and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter.
   (B)   Professional Engineer Review:
      1.   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer
under the employ or contract of the village for review to ensure that the
development meets section
4-5-7 or
4-5-8 of this chapter.
      2.   In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing
that the development meets the requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter.
   (C)   Dam Safety Requirements:
      1.   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage
potential in the event of failure.
      2.   The construction or major modification of all class I (high hazard)
and class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
      3.   Some class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel detention basins that
have an embankment are nonjurisdictional class III dams. It is not required
that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all nonjurisdictional class III dams.
      4.   A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a
hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is
required.
      5.   A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the
construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
      6.   Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures.
   (D)   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required federal, state
and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   (E)   Plan Review And Permit Issuance:
      1.   Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this chapter; and
      2.   Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   (F)   Inspection Review:
      1.   Inspect all development projects before, during and after
construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
      2.   Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and
document the results of the inspection.
   (G)   Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged
buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with subsection
4-5-9(C)3 of this chapter.
   (H)   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain permit files
including:
      1.   An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject
to section
4-5-9 of this chapter; and/or
      2.   The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to
section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
   (I)   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as
built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   (J)   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections
4-5-7 and
4-5-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the
village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      1.   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      2.   IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in the
definition of "dam" in section

projects, including projects of the village and county, except for those
projects meeting the requirements of subsection
4-5-7-2(A) of this chapter;
      3.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per subsection
4-5-7-2(C)5 of this chapter;
      4.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection
4-5-7-2(C)4 of this chapter;

improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve
the administration of this chapter;
      2.   Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a
regulatory map within six (6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain
may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain
map;
      3.   Submit reports as required for the national flood insurance program;
and
      4.   Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
   (L)   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter changes. (Ord. 08-
07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for
the village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is
not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other
sources. When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit
a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any
development of the site.
   (A)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
the sanitary and ship canal shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA dated
August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared
from time to time.
   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the village of Forest View or that may be annexed into the
village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood
insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and
such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time.
   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County.
   (D)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide flood insurance
rate map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing data available
from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an
engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood
elevations.
      1.   When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be
determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model
such as HIP.
      2.   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques
presented in various publications prepared by the United States geological
survey for estimating peak flood discharges.
      3.   For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the
historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed
engineering study.
      4.   For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1
square mile) which has been identified by the building commissioner pursuant to
subsection
4-5-4(A)3 of this chapter, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the
applicant utilizing a method as approved in this section. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-
2008)
4-5-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
   (A)   Development Permit:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the building commissioner.
      2.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the building commissioner.
         (a)   The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations, using the North American vertical datum of 1988, and
all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings.
         (b)   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
      3.   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the building
commissioner shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation.
         (a)   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The building commissioner shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map identification.
      4.   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall
be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
      5.   The building commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals
or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The building
commissioner shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and
local permits have been obtained.
   (B)   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      1.   Using Fill For Elevation: If fill is being used to elevate the site
above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for
the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      2.   Compensatory Storage:
         (a)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
         (b)   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
         (c)   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall
be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
         (d)   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
         (e)   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   (C)   Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE):
A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a
site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate
the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to construct
the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe.
The building commissioner shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant
has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections:
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection (B)2 of this
section.
      2.   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
      3.   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the
FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the building commissioner may waive the ten foot (10') minimum setback if
an Illinois licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method
to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met.
The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural
design analysis, which shall be submitted to the building commissioner for
review. The building commissioner may require such additional documentation as
necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the
structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than
four feet (4').
      4.   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained,
the building commissioner may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback
distance if an Illinois licensed professional engineer certifies that an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic
pressures has been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving
that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from
flooding, shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the
setback distance be less than four feet (4').
      5.   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under
the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of an LOMR-
F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering purposes.
      6.   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the
same direction.
      7.   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the
site conditions.
      8.   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five feet (5') below the BFE.
      9.   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and
minimum of one-fourth (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4)
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      10.   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      11.   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
      12.   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the building commissioner
may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant
demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and
requirements set forth in FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe
from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is
reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed
engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered
basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA
technical bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an
Illinois licensed professional engineer.
      13.   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural
grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation,
if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-
2008)

(Ord. 08-07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-7-2: PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES AND A LIST OF APPROPRIATE USES:
   (A)   Development In Floodway: The only development in a floodway which will
be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood
elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 will be allowed. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
      1.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      2.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access
to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
      4.   Underground and overhead utilities;
      5.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any 1
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      6.   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      7.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
      8.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
         (a)   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will
not exceed 1.0 foot; or
         (b)   The applicant of a short term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during over bank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all over
bank flooding events;
      9.   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a watercourse;
      10.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure;
      11.   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation;
      12.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Restrictions On Appropriate Uses: Appropriate uses do not include the
construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions,
buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate
otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping
or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as
specifically defined above as an appropriate use.
   (C)   Criteria For Construction Of An Appropriate Use: Within the designated
floodway, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered
permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering
and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans,
calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any
structure meets the protection requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter:
      1.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages
Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on
stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         (a)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n"
is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, "Open Channel Hydraulics", [McGraw-Hill, New York 1959]).
         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
         (c)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
(1) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of
one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length
shall be used.
(4) Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid
expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
(5) All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular
to flood flows.
      2.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding:
         (a)   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
         (b)   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
         (c)   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
         (d)   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
         (e)   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
         (f)   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result
of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce
flooding at existing structure.
      3.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights:
         (a)   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         (b)   In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built
for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows,
velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
      4.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches:
         (a)   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements.
         (b)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages
greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit
for a dam or waiver.
(1) The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using
the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater
conditions for the flood study specified in section
4-5-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly
accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
(2) Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection (C)2 of this
section.
(3) Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (C)3 of this section.
(4) If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
(5) The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the
existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/
OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this section.
(6) All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per
subsection (C)8 of this section.
      5.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And
Approach Roads:
         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is
a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 (floodway
construction in northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued.
      6.   On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
         (a)   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded
flood easements.
         (b)   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
         (c)   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in the definition
of "dam" in section
4-5-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois
administrative code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
(1) The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing
flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
(2) The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
(3) The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or
habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin;
(4) A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is
more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which
the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities
to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
(5) The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section
4-5-7.
      7.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures:
         (a)   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no farther than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building.
         (b)   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required
for floodproofing activities.
      8.   Excavation In The Floodway:
         (a)   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert
openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and
culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate
uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
         (b)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
(1) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length; and
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of
one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length
shall be used; and
(4) Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream
of the transition sections.
      9.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a stream side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat;
         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
         (c)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
(1) The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely
as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and
sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of
more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel
modification design, where practical.
(2) Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream
and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent
erosion.
(3) One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of
streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel,
where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the
vegetation.
(4) Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for construction of the channel.
(5) Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three
to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation
and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where
high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization
measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap are preferred
approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
(6) All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or
otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction.
Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize
disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.
(7) If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep
pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in
the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible
with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate.
(8) A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the
modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
(9) New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of
construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of
water into the new channel.
(10) There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or
leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public
flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a
habitat improvement or erosion control project.
(11) Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall
be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a
result of the modification; and
         (d)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section
4-5-7.
      10.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      11.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to the
initiation of improvements.
         (b)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion
of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at
final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
         (c)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
         (d)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in
width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels (see subsection (C)16 of this section). Construction vehicle use of
channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed,
where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along
channels shall be restabilized immediately.
         (e)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban
Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"Green Book" and the "Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
      12.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      13.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in section
4-5-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the
study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be
contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data
to use.
         (b)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
(1) The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
(2) Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         (c)   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      14.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision:
         (a)   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
         (b)   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
         (c)   In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
         (d)   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
         (e)   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
      15.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall
be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer.
      16.   Construction Within Twenty Five Feet Of Channel: For all activities
in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the
channel, the following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         (b)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         (c)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use
may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a
final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built"
plans.
   (D)   Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State
Review: For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or
county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway:
      1.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge
pursuant to subsection (C)4 of this section.

   (A)   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a
"designated floodway" as defined in section
4-5-2 of this chapter.
      1.   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the village of Forest
View for a variance.
      2.   The building commissioner shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the president and board of
trustees. The village may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as
it deems necessary to further the flood protection intent of this chapter.
   (B)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA; and
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted; and
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary; and
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety,
beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation
of a nuisance; and
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations,
policing, or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities, or other
public facilities; and
      6.   The provisions of subsections
4-5-6(B) and
4-5-8(B) of this chapter shall still be met; and
      7.   The activity is not in a designated floodway; and
      8.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      9.   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved including existing stream uses; and
      10.   All other required state and federal permits or waivers have been
obtained.
   (C)   The building commissioner shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage; and
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant will acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (D)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site
or "historic structure" as defined in section
4-5-2 of this chapter may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of subsections (A) and (B) of this section, subject to the
conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure; and
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
   (A)   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
   (B)   Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes.
   (C)   This chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside
of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage.
   (D)   This chapter does not create liability on the part of the village of
Forest View or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-13: PENALTY:
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (B)   The building commissioner shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore,
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      1.   The building commissioner is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in
writing, shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work
order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      2.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the president and board of trustees. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: a) the
grounds for complaint or reasons for suspension or revocation; and b) the time
and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the president and board of trustees shall determine whether the permit
shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 08-07, 5-13-2008)
4-5-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
   (A)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.

restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
   (C)   This chapter is intended to repeal the original ordinance or
resolution which was adopted to meet the national flood insurance program

explosives, or shall have, keep, sell, use, or give away any black powder in
excess of five (5) pounds, guncotton, blasting powder, giant powder, dynamite,
nitroglycerine, fulminate of mercury, or any other explosives, or any
substances, compound, mixture, or article having properties of such a character

conditions of a sentence which imposes financial obligations upon the offender
unless such failure is due to his wilful refusal to pay.

Village or on its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice to
all parties and a hearing.
(5) If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at any time
prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue the
offender on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging the
conditions, or may impose any other penalty that was available at the time of
the initial penalty.

appealable order.

liable therefor to the Village. Application for village water service must be
made in the owner's name with the owner's current mailing address.
   (C)   Due Date: All bills for residential water service shall be payable not
later than the close of business on the last day of the month following the end
of the billing period. All bills for industrial and commercial water service
shall be payable not later than the close of business on the fifteenth day
following the end of the billing period. A penalty of ten percent (10%) shall
be added to the principal amount of any bill (including all arrearages) not
paid within said thirty (30) day period or fifteen (15) day period, as the case
may be. (Ord. 97-16, 7-22-1997)
   (D)   Delinquent Charges: Whenever any charges for water service, or service
charges for installation, disconnection, turnon or shutoff of water service
remain unpaid, in whole or in part, for thirty (30) days (15 days for
commercial/industrial customers), such charges shall be deemed delinquent. Once
an account has been deemed to be delinquent, the water clerk shall immediately
send a series of three (3) letters spaced seven (7) business days apart
notifying the customer of the delinquency. If the account is not paid after the
third letter has been sent, a fourth and final letter notifying the customer
that if after seven (7) business days, the account remains delinquent, water
service will be terminated. This process will take place only once during any
rolling twelve (12) month period beginning on the date the initial late notice
is sent. Subsequent delinquencies will only receive the fourth or final notice
providing for a disconnect after seven (7) business days. Whenever the premises
is occupied by a person or persons other than the owner, and the village has
previously received notice of this, the notice of delinquency shall be mailed
to the owner of the property if his/her address is known to the village.
   (E)   Disconnection Of Service For Nonpayment; Reinstatement Fee: The water
supply may be shut off from any premises for which the water bill remains
unpaid for thirty (30) days (15 days for commercial/industrial customers) after
the rendition of the bill for such service. If water service is discontinued
after the owner of the premises or his/her representative has failed to make
payment, water service shall not be reinstated until all past due bills and
penalties due thereon are paid in full, together with payment of a fee of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for shutoff of service for delinquency and a fee of
one hundred dollars ($100.00) for cost of reinstating service to the location.
The second shutoff and reinstatement is subject to surcharges of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) each. A third such occurrence will result in surcharges
of two hundred dollars ($200.00) each and shall remain at this rate for any
subsequent disconnects.
   (F)   Delinquent Charges; Lien: Whenever any charges for water service or
service charges for installation, disconnection, turnon or shutoff of water
service remain unpaid, in whole or in part, for thirty (30) days (15 days for
commercial/industrial customers) such charges shall be deemed delinquent. After
the prescribed collection process has been followed and the account remains
delinquent, the water superintendent shall exercise his/her discretion to
initiate proceedings to place a lien upon the said property, by having the
village file a statement of lien claim with the Cook County recorder of deeds.
This statement of lien claim shall include the legal description of the
property to which service is provided; the amount unpaid including penalty; and
a notice that the village claims a lien for stated amount as well as for all
water service charges and penalties, subsequent to the period for which the
bill was rendered. Whenever the premises is occupied by a person or persons
other than the owner, and the village has previously received notice of this,
notice of delinquency and lien shall be mailed to the owner of the property if
his/her address is known to the village. The failure of the village to record
the lien with the Cook County recorder of deeds or to mail the notice of
delinquency and lien to the owner of the property or failure of the owner to
receive such notice, shall not affect the right of the village to foreclose the
lien for unpaid bills as mentioned herein. Property subject to a lien for
unpaid water charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds
of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by
bill in equity in the name of the village. The village attorney is hereby
authorized to initiate such proceedings against any property for which the bill
has remained unpaid for ninety (90) days after it has been rendered. (Ord. 05-
05, 9-27-2005)
   (G)   Severance And Restoration Of Water Service After Tampering: If it is
found that the water supply has been restored by persons other than water
department personnel to a building in violation of the provisions of the
waterworks ordinance, the village board shall have the authority to sever the
service through which the water is being supplied to any such building. No
water shall again be supplied to the premises until the charges of such
severing and also any other unpaid charges have been paid. The charges
hereinbefore provided shall be paid by the persons owning or occupying the
building at the time it is desired to have the water service restored,
irrespective of whether such person is being held responsible for any tampering
with the B box shutoff.
   (H)   Security Deposit: Whenever water service has been terminated due to
delinquency of payment, the water superintendent may require a security deposit
from the owner of the premises before restoring water service to the said
premises. The security deposit must be in the form of cash or certified check
and is not applicable to any future charges. (Ord. 97-16, 7-22-1997)
8-2-3: TURN ON/OFF CHARGE, AND CONNECTION CHARGE:

delinquencies shall be increased to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and two
hundred dollars ($200.00) respectively. In addition, there shall be a service
charge for each water or sewer connection made, which charge shall be based on
the diameter of the water or sewer service connection serving any property or

There is hereby granted by the Village to Grantee the right and privilege to
construct, erect, operate and maintain, in, upon, along, across, above, over or
under the streets, alleys, easements, public ways and public places now laid

16-1979)
8-4-4: INDEMNIFICATION:
Grantee shall indemnify, defend and save the Village harmless from any and all

incurred by the Village in enforcing this provision; and for this purpose,
Grantee shall carry property damage and personal injury insurance with some

legal action is due or within twenty one (21) days after the claim or demand is
made upon the Village, whichever notice yields Grantee the larger amount of
time within which to prepare an answer. Failure by the Village to properly
notify Grantee in accordance with the foregoing of any such claim, suit or
demand against the Village shall release Grantee from its obligation to
indemnify the Village as provided herein, if the Grantee is prejudiced thereby.

the Village where other public utilities have been installed underground. The
Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, replace all paving, sidewalks,
driveways, parkways, or surfaces so disturbed in as good condition as before
work was commenced. No open cuts in streets, sidewalks or driveways shall be
allowed, except as approved by the Village Superintendent of Public Works.

designee may, at its option, cause such work to be done and the Grantee shall

Village Board or its designee to the Grantee within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such itemized report.

all streets, alleys, easements, sidewalks and public places of the Village in

of this Chapter. Within thirty (30) days following said four (4) year period,
the Grantee shall provide written notice to the Village of the option
hereinafter granted. Upon receipt of such notice, the Village, within a period
of ninety (90) days, may in its sole judgment, determine that it will in the
future exercise this option to regulate all future rate increases for Grantee's
regular subscription services or other services if such regulation is permitted

8-4-14: PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL AND MUNICIPAL CONNECTIONS:
Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC:
   (A)   Grantee shall without charge make one aerial connection for regular
subscriber services, as provided below into the internal distribution system of
each Village office building, police station, fire station, library and school
within the Village (hereinafter singly or collectively referred to as the
"Premises"). Grantee shall make a connection at one outlet in each such
premises for the purpose of enabling the said premises to distribute the
regular subscriber service. Where such premises consists of more than one
building, only one tie-in and connection shall be made.
   (B)   Grantee shall make such tie-in and connection at the location
designated by the appropriate official as the location of the "head-end" of the
internal distribution system of the premises. The responsibility of Grantee
shall terminate when the tie-in and connection to the internal distribution
system is completed, and the responsibility for performance of the internal
distribution system, and for distribution of the transmissions throughout such
system shall be solely that of the premises. Grantee makes no representation or
warranty as to the ability of such distribution system to carry the programs
transmitted over its cable system; however, Grantee will offer, without charge,
technical consulting services to the premises in order to make the internal
system work effectively for the purposes intended herein.
   (C)   The procedure for making such connections shall be as follows:
Connections will be made at the time when Grantee is serving the area within
which the premises is located. At such time, Grantee shall send written
notification of the provisions of this paragraph to such premises. Thereafter,
upon written request from the recipient official, Grantee will make the above
described tie-in and connection to the internal distribution system of such
premises. When Grantee is serving the area, but the building on the Premises to
be connected with an aerial installation is located more than five hundred feet
(500') from the nearest CATV cable, the cost of the aerial cable installation
beyond five hundred feet (500') will be paid by the premises. For underground
installations, Grantee shall charge the recipient its actual cost. Such costs
will be submitted to said premises, in writing, before installation is begun.
All such premises will be connected according to the orderly progress and
construction of the system. (Ord. 79-24, 10-16-1979)
8-4-15: INTERFACE OF CATV COMPANIES:
Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC, in the event that
more than one franchise is issued within, or immediately adjacent to the
Village, and if such operating systems are contiguous and technically
compatible with Grantee, and have allocated access channels, Grantee shall
provide suitable interconnection facilities for one access channel at the
boundary of its service areas. In no event, however, shall Grantee be required
to interconnect with a cable system not having substantially the same access
provisions in its franchise as contained in this franchise, unless such system
agrees voluntarily to connect with Grantee, nor shall Grantee be required to
interconnect at any point beyond any area where it has trunk or feeder service.
In no event shall interconnection be required where the combined cable systems
include more than fifty (50) trunk amplifiers in cascade or as the state-of-
the-art then permits. (Ord. 79-24, 10-16-1979)
8-4-16: STUDIO FACILITY:

This facility shall be available on a time-sharing basis to the Village, its
agencies, public service organizations and schools lying wholly or partly

   (A)   All plumbing installed within the Village shall be installed in
accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code, 77 Ill. Adm. Code 890. If in
accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code or in the judgment of the
Superintendent of Water, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary
for the safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent of Water
will give notice to the water customer to install such an approved device
immediately. The water customer shall, at his own expense, install such an
approved device at a location and in a manner in accordance with the Illinois
Plumbing Code, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and all applicable
local regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made of such approved
devices upon installation and as required by the Illinois Plumbing Code,
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and local regulations.
   (B)   No person shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or
permit to be maintained any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the
Village may enter the supply or distribution system of said Municipality,
unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Superintendent of Water and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Water to cause surveys
and investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply to determine whether actual or potential hazards to the
public water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a
matter of public record and shall be repeated at least every two (2) years, or
as often as the Superintendent of Water shall deem necessary. Records of such
surveys shall be maintained and available for review for a period of at least
five (5) years.
   (D)   The approved Cross-Connection Control Device Inspector shall have the
right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to
the public water supply or distribution system of the Village for the purpose
of verifying the presence or absence of cross-connections, and the Water
Superintendent or his authorized agent shall have the right to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the Village for the purpose of verifying information
submitted by the customer regarding the required cross-connection control
inspection. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served
shall furnish to the Superintendent of Water any information which he may
request regarding the piping system or systems of water use on such property.
The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of
the Superintendent of Water, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper
connections as provided in this Chapter.
   (E)   The Superintendent of Water of the Village is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the
provisions of this Chapter is known to exist, and to take such other
precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service to
such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been eliminated
or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, and until a
reconnection fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is paid to the Village.
Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected when the
Superintendent of Water is assured that imminent danger of harmful
contamination of the public water supply system exists. Such action shall be
followed by written notification of the cause of disconnection. Immediate
disconnection without notice to any party can be effected to prevent actual or
anticipated contamination or pollution of the public water supply, provided
that, in the reasonable opinion of the Superintendent of Water or the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, such action is required to prevent actual or
potential contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Neither the
public water supply, the Superintendent of Water, or its agents or assigns
shall be liable to any customer for any injury, damages or lost revenues which
may result from termination of said customer's water supply in accordance with
the terms of this Chapter, whether or not said termination was with or without
notice.
   (F)   The consumer responsible for backsiphoned or back pressured material
or contamination through backflow, if contamination of the potable water supply
system occurs through an illegal cross-connection or an improperly installed,
maintained or repaired device, or a device which has been bypassed, must bear
the cost of cleanup of the potable water supply system. (Ord. 91-1, 1-22-1991,

served by the public potable water supply system of the Village.
   (C)   Policy: The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water or his
authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary
for the safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent of Water
shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention
device at each service connection to the premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such approved device or devices at his own expense;
failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install such
device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water
service to the premises until such device or devices have been installed. The
consumer shall retain records of installation, maintenance, testing and repair
as required in subsection
8-5-6(D)4 below for a period of at least five (5) years. The Superintendent of

8-6-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this Chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the Village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent: In enacting this Chapter, the Village of Forest View intends
to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the Village of Forest View
and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village of Forest View's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in
rights-of-way or public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village of Forest View's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities Subject to This Chapter: This Chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public
rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this Chapter may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement. This Chapter shall not apply to any facilities
constructed by others to be owned by the Village.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements: The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this Chapter.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this Chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with Other Ordinances: This Chapter supersedes all
ordinances or parts of ordinances adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith to the extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with State and Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
Chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or State laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound Engineering Judgment: The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this Chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this Chapter when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 18-09, 7-24-2018)

8-6-5: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS:
   (A)   Village Review of Permit Applications: Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by Village Engineer
and the Superintendent of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing.
If the application does not conform to the requirements of all applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Engineer or
Superintendent of Public Works shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Village Engineer and Superintendent of
Public Works are satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements
of this Chapter and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Superintendent of Public Works shall issue a permit therefor
as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant
to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer or Superintendent
of Public Works that the construction proposed under the application shall be
in full compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
   (B)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this Chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent of Public Works
shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be
placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event that the Superintendent of Public Works fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either: (a) ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction, or (b) twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this Chapter. For purposes of determining when the ten
or twenty-five day period specified in this sub-section begins, service of
notice to the Village shall be considered to have occurred on the date that the
Village has received all of the documentation required to be submitted under
Section
8-6-5(B)(1).
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Section
8-6-4 of this Chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of Subsection (A) of this
Section.
   (C)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007: Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five (45) days
after the submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon the Village,
provided the holder has complied with all applicable Village codes, ordinances
and regulations.
   (D)   Additional Review of Applications and Standards for Personal Wireless
Services Facilities (but excluding small wireless facilities): For a personal
wireless services facility in the right-of-way, review by the Village Engineer
and the Superintendent of Public Works of the application information in light
of the requirements in this Section. Standards for personal wireless services
review include:
      1.   The Village Engineer and the Superintendent of Public Works will
not:
         (a)   Unreasonably discriminate among the providers of functionally
equivalent services;
         (b)   Prohibit or create the effect of prohibiting the provision of
personal wireless services by a wireless carrier; or
         (c)   Regulate the placement, installation, and modification of
personal wireless services facilities on the basis of the environmental effects
of radio frequency emissions to the extent such facilities comply with the
FCC's regulations concerning such emissions.
      2.   The Village may reasonably limit the number of sites for personal
wireless services facilities available within the Village at the particular
time of the application and in the particular locations listed in the
application, based on the current inventory and locations of available sites
and current total demand for sites by wireless carriers.
      3.   The Village Engineer and the Superintendent of Public Works must
review a properly completed permit application within a reasonable time
consistent with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. A denial of
an application for a permit must be made in writing, stating the reason or
reasons for the denial. If the Village Engineer and the Superintendent of
Public Works are satisfied that the application conforms to the requirements of
this Chapter and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
then the Superintendent of Public Works must approve the application and issue
the permit as soon as practicable.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, applications for small wireless
facilities shall be made and processed pursuant to the Village regulations
implementing the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act. (Ord. 18-09, 7-24-
2018)
8-6-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration: No permit issued under this Chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless the construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-Construction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this Chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with
such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit and
special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including,
without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area
and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. 18-09, 7-24-2018)
8-6-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this Chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with Section 8-6-21 of this Chapter. If
the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord. 18-
09, 7-24-2018)
8-6-8: INSURANCE:
   (A)   Required Coverages and Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs 1 and 2 below:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
   (B)   Excess or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this Section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this Section to the Village within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village. In lieu of a copy of
the policy, a certificate indicating that the insurance policies required by
this Section have been obtained and are in force, may be submitted with the
approval of the Superintendent of Public Works.
   (D)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until ten (10) days after receipt by the
Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Village's Superintendent of Public Works of
such intent to cancel or not to renew."
   Within seven days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no
event later than three days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this Section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by Subsection (A) of this
Section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under Subsection a), or the requirements of Subsections (B), (C) and
(D) of this Section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under Subsection (A) of
this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer"
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this Section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the utility in the State of Illinois.
(Ord. 18-09, 7-24-2018)

deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, and costs
of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of
or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 18-09, 7-24-2018)
8-6-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be

required by this Chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location within Cook, McHenry, Lake, Kane, or DuPage

seized by the police department or any other law enforcement or governmental
agency and sold, any unpaid removal, towing, storage, and processing charges
and collection costs shall be paid to the towing service from the proceeds of
the sale. If applicable law provides that the proceeds are to be paid into the
village treasury, then any unpaid removal, towing, storage, and processing

proceeds from the sale, with the balance to be paid by the owner, operator, or
other legally entitled person.
   (D)   Upon delivery of a written release order to the towing service, a
vehicle subject to a hold order shall be released to the owner, operator, or

be made of the secretary of state of the particular jurisdiction for the
furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner of the
vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address
furnished, though in no case will the village be required to delay towing more

the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing,
a pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven (7) day period, the vehicle may be
towed if the owner has not filed a written request for a hearing within the
seven (7) day period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed waived.
   (B)   Scheduling Of Pre-Tow Hearings: The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled

persons who reside more than fifty (50) miles from the village may be made by
mail. Forms for such requests shall be made available at the police department.
At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date
and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.
   (D)   Appointment Of Hearing Officer: The village shall choose an officer or
employee of the village to serve as hearing officer. In no case shall the
hearing officer be an individual who was involved in the initial decision to
tow the vehicle. The hearing officer shall have the authority to require the
presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow or any other
village personnel.
   (E)   Nature Of Hearing: The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant
evidence, the hearing officer shall make a written decision based upon a
preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized
by the laws of the state or village ordinances, with a specific statutory or
ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall be provided a copy of
such pre-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Decision To Tow And Rates To Be Charged: If the preponderance of the

the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and
storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees to be charged
for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates posted
by the towing service operator pursuant to the provisions of subsection
9-4-7(E) of this chapter. The owner of such vehicle, having had such a hearing,
may avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper
location to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition(s)
of the vehicle.

      1.   If the preponderance of the evidence fails to support towing of the
vehicle, the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle shall not be towed.
The village shall furnish a copy of such decision to the owner, who may place
it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible from the outside, such as
the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which such a decision has been
rendered shall be towed by the village unless the circumstances under which the
decision was rendered have changed.
      2.   If, at some subsequent time, the village should wish to tow the
vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required
for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.
   (H)   Reports And Documents To Be Retained; Contesting Decision: Originals
or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any
associated police reports or documents, shall be retained by the police
department for a period of at least five (5) years after each hearing. The

secretary of state of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the
most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and
notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished. The notice

contain substantially the following information:
      1.   A description of the vehicle;
      2.   The present location of the impounded vehicle;
      3.   The legal and factual basis for the particular tow;
      4.   The opportunity to request a post-tow hearing and the procedure for
filing a written request for hearing;

operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least
twelve inches by eighteen inches (12" x 18"), indicating the opportunity and
procedures for a hearing to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign
shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public transacting business
at any towing facility. If the towing service operator performs services for
more than one municipality, the information for contacting the various
appropriate municipal officers can be listed on one such sign.
   (C)   Requests For Post-Tow Hearings:
      1.   Requests for hearings may be made in person at the office indicated
on the notice within fifteen (15) days of the mailing or personal delivery of
the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle, whichever occurs first;
otherwise the right to a hearing shall be deemed waived. Requests for hearings
by persons who reside more than fifty (50) miles from the Village may be made
in person or by mail received by the Village within the fifteen (15) day
period.
      2.   Any police personnel receiving inquiries in the field for hearings
shall direct such person to the police station.
      3.   Police personnel in the police station, when receiving a tow
inquiry, shall advise the person making the inquiry of the right to a hearing
as set forth herein, and upon request shall provide a hearing request form.
   (D)   Release Of Vehicles:
      1.   The owner of the vehicle shall be responsible for all towing and
storage charges. Vehicles authorized to be removed from public or private
property by the Police Department and stored by a towing service operator hired
by the Village shall be subject to a possessor lien for services pursuant to
"An Act Concerning Liens for Labor, Services, Skill or Materials Furnished Upon
Or Storage Furnished for Chattels", filed July 24, 1941, as amended, and the
provisions of section 1 of that Act relating to notice and implied consent
shall be deemed satisfied by compliance with section 18a-302 and subsection (6)
of section 18a-300 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. In no event shall such lien be
greater than the rate or rates established in accordance with subsection (6) of
section 18a-200(3) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. In no event shall such lien be
increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or materials rendered
in addition to those authorized by such Act. Every such lien shall be payable
by use of any major credit card, in addition to being payable in cash. (Ord.
00-10, 9-12-2000)
      2.   Before the owner or a person entitled to possession of any impounded
vehicle shall be permitted to remove the same, the owner or other person
legally entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his or her identity,
ownership of the vehicle, or his or her right to possession, sign a receipt for
the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing and storage fees to
the towing service operator. The Chief of Police is authorized to promulgate
regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to establish these
facts. (Ord. 17-07, 4-11-2017)
   (E)   Establishment Of Maximum Towing And Storage Rates:
      1.   The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing
and storage on police ordered tows at rates that do not exceed the maximum rate
schedule posted at the storage site and on file with the Police Department. The
basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and on the sign concerning
vehicle release requirements.
      2.   However, nothing in this section is intended to prevent a
competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established
maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows. For particularly difficult
or unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious accidents, the towing
operators may charge rates above those established for normal situations. The
special charges must be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into
account such matters as the man-hours and equipment time required for the job.
A towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a
billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and
supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner and the police department. Any
such special rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area
for the nature and extent of the services provided. Every towing service
operator and the police department shall have available a copy of the complete
current rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the towing
service operator, for vehicle owners to view upon request. (Ord. 00-10, 9-12-
2000)
9-4-8: POST-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES:
   (A)   Opportunity For Hearing: The owner of a vehicle towed as an immediate
tow, by or pursuant to the authority of the police department as set forth
herein, shall be provided the opportunity for a post-tow hearing to determine
the validity of such tow and any towing or storage charges. The hearing will
not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any
towed vehicle.
   (B)   Nature Of The Hearing And Hearing Officer: The nature of the hearing
and the appointment of the hearing officer shall be the same as set forth in
section
9-4-6 of this chapter.
   (C)   Time Of Hearings: Hearings shall take place as follows:
      1.   In those instances where the vehicle has been released upon the
deposit of the full payment currently owed for towing and storage charges, and
the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall take place within
fifteen (15) days after the release of such vehicle, unless the owner requests
a later date convenient to all parties.
      2.   In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded, the hearing
shall take place, at the option of the owner:
         (a)   On the next calendar day after the owner's demand for such
hearing, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. If such demand is made
after three o'clock (3:00) P.M., or if the unavailability of a necessary
witness or evidence creates a particular difficulty in conducting the hearing
on the next calendar day, then a hearing shall be held on the second day
following the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; or
         (b)   If acceptable to the owner, within fifteen (15) days of such
request on a date convenient to all parties.
   (D)   Duties Of The Hearing Officer:
      1.   The hearing officer, or other designated personnel of the village,
processing the owner's request for a hearing, shall have the authority to
designate in writing a hearing date and time, and to so inform the owner of the
date and time of the hearing by personal service at the time the owner files a
hearing request. In the event that a hearing request is made by mail by a
person residing more than fifty (50) miles from the village, the written
designation of the hearing date and time shall be mailed to the owner not less
than seven (7) days before the designated hearing date, unless the owner waives
such seven (7) day period by requesting an earlier hearing date;
      2.   The hearing officer shall review all evidence presented by the
vehicle owner and the police department or other village employees, and shall
make a finding based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented, as to
the lawful authority of the towing and storage of the vehicle. The village must
establish such authority by a preponderance of the evidence;
      3.   For each hearing, the hearing officer shall complete a post- tow
hearing decision and attach such decision to the police department's original
towing report, and supply a copy of the decision to the owner by personal
delivery if the owner is present, otherwise by mail.
   (E)   Post-Tow Hearing Decision: After receiving all relevant evidence, the
hearing officer shall make one of the following written findings, which must be
incorporated into the post-tow hearing decision:
      1.   Tow Authorized: The towing and storage of the vehicle was authorized
by state statute or village ordinance. One or more specific statutory or
ordinance sections and the amount owed for towing and storage shall be stated
in such a finding;
      2.   Tow Not Authorized: There was no authorization in law for the towing
and storage of the vehicle, or the village employee causing the vehicle to be
towed did not comply with the requirements of the state statute or village
ordinance authorizing the tow;
      3.   Tow Authorized; Storage Reimbursable: The towing of the vehicle was
authorized by law, but the owner was caused to incur additional storage charges
because of late notification of towing or other reasons not the fault of the
owner. The specific amount owed by the owner, and the specific amount excused,
shall be stated in the decision; or
      4.   Owner Failed To Appear; No Continuance Requested: A hearing was
requested but the person requesting the hearing failed to appear and failed to
request a continuance. This finding also constitutes a default finding that the
tow was authorized by the applicable State Statute or Village ordinance as
stated in the post-tow notice.
   (F)   Actions By Hearing Officer Upon Conclusion Of Hearing: The Hearing
Officer shall advise the owner of his or her findings at the conclusion of the
hearing, and take the following actions:
      1.   If the towing and storage was found to be authorized by law, and is
not otherwise reimbursable, the owner shall be so informed and further advised
as to the amount then due for towing and storage if the vehicle has remained
impounded;
      2.   If the towing and/or storage is found to be unauthorized or
reimbursable, the Hearing Officer shall:
         (a)   If the vehicle has been released to the owner:
(1) Note the amount of the towing and storage fees prepaid by the owner on the
post-tow hearing decision;
(2) Complete a printed voucher form for the amount to be reimbursed; (Ord. 00-

(3) Transmit said decision and voucher form to the Chief of Police for his
authorization for payment; (Ord. 17-07, 4-11-2017)
(4) Advise the owner that a refund of said cash deposit or fees will be
transmitted to the appropriate officials of the Village for payment;
(5) Transmit a copy of said hearing decision and the voucher to the appropriate
Village official within forty eight (48) hours of the hearing;
(6) Unless the Village files a lawsuit to contest the decision of the Hearing
Officer, the owner shall be paid the money due within thirty (30) days after
the decision of the Hearing Officer.
         (b)   If the vehicle is still in the possession of the towing company
at the time of the hearing, the following procedures shall be followed:
(1) An order for the release of the vehicle shall be prepared in duplicate; the
owner shall be provided with the original, and a copy shall be attached to the
post-tow decision;
(2) Upon presentation by the owner to the towing company of the order for
release, said vehicle shall immediately be released to the owner without
payment of any service charges excused by the hearing decision.
   (G)   Reports And Documents To Be Retained; Contesting Decision: All
originals or copies of the notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports,
and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police
Department for a period of at least five (5) years after each hearing. The
Village or the owner may contest the decision of the Hearing Officer in any
manner provided by law. (Ord. 00-10, 9-12-2000)
9-4-9: TOWING SERVICE SUBJECT TO ORDINANCE:
Notwithstanding any other ordinance or statutory provisions to the contrary,
any towing service operator authorized to perform tows on behalf of the Village
must perform its services subject to the provisions of this chapter. However,
the towing company shall have the right to recover the reasonable value of its
services for police ordered tows, from the Village. Provided, however, that if
a tow or the charge for a tow is found by a court having competent
jurisdiction, to be illegal and the towing service operator is required to
return the charge for the tow to the owner of the vehicle, the Village shall
not be liable to reimburse the operator for the towing charges. (Ord. 00-10, 9-
12-2000)
9-4-10: RECORD SEARCHES; IDENTIFICATION:
   (A)   Search Procedures: When the Police Department cannot determine the
owner of the vehicle from registration files of this State or a foreign state,
if applicable, the department will request, by directed communication to the
State police, that the stolen motor vehicle files be searched for stolen or
wanted information on the vehicle. If the State files are searched with
negative results, the information contained in the National Crime Information
Center ("NCIC") files will be searched by the State police. The information
determined from these record searches will be returned to the Police Department
for its use in sending notification by certified mail to the owner advising
where the vehicle is held, requesting a disposition to be made, and setting
forth public sale information. Said notification will be sent no later than ten
(10) business days after the date the police department impounds the vehicle;
provided, however, if the police department is unable to determine the identity
of the owner within a ten (10) day business period after impoundment, then
notification shall be sent no later than two (2) days after the date the
identity of the owner of the impounded vehicle is determined. Exceptions to
notification by certified mail to the owner are set forth in section
9-4-12 of this chapter.
   (B)   Identifying And Tracing Of Vehicle Ownership By State Police: When the
owner cannot be identified from the registration files of this state or a
foreign state, if applicable, the police department shall notify the state
police for the purpose of identifying the owner. The information obtained by

debt due and owing the village. If a cash bond or other form of monetary
payment acceptable to the village has been posted pursuant to this chapter,
such amount shall be applied to the total penalty assessed at the hearing.
Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty or
administrative fee imposed under this chapter, which remains unpaid in whole or
in part after the expiration of the deadline for seeking judicial review under
the administrative review law, may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided otherwise in
this chapter, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until: 1) the
administrative penalty is paid to the village and any applicable towing and
storage fees are paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle
shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle; or
2) the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to
enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative penalty and other
applicable fees are not paid within thirty five (35) days after the hearing
officer issues a written decision, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided for the disposition of unclaimed
vehicles under section 4-208 of the Illinois vehicle code, 625 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/4-208, as amended; provided, however, where proceedings
have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the
vehicle may not be disposed of by the village except in a manner consistent
with the disposition of vehicles that is provided for in those proceedings.
   (B)   Vehicle Possession: Except as otherwise specifically provided by law,
no owner, lienholder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take
possession of a vehicle impounded under this chapter until the administrative
penalty and other applicable fees under this chapter have been paid in full.
However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle
has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given
to that person if he/she agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount
of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay
all lienholders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty plus
applicable fees. (Ord. 12-1, 3-27-2012)

   * Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within
the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
(1) Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source of
emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area; thereby
obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre.
(2) From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in subsection (D)5(b)(1)
above, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of
emission set forth in the table; thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission.
(3) Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in subsection
(D)5(b)(2) above, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of
emission within the boundaries of the lot; such total shall not exceed one
pound per acre of lot area during any one hour.
      6.   In the M-2 District the following additional regulations shall
apply:
         (a)   The emission of more than sixteen (16) smoke units per stack in

shall be permitted up to twenty four (24) smoke units (not to exceed Ringelmann
No. 3) in thirty (30) minutes for soot blowing and cleaning fires.
         (b)   The rate of particulate matter emission from all sources within
the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of four (4) pounds per
acre during any one hour, after deducting from the gross hourly emission per
acre the correct factor set forth in the following table:
   Allowance for Height of Emission*

10-13-1: PURPOSE:
The planned unit development special use is a concept which encourages improved
design in the development of land by providing relief from the standards
established for districts. The concept provides for a mixture of uses otherwise
permitted only in separate zones and for a more flexible use of development
standards, including yards, height and bulk regulations based on design
excellence and improved performance, so that the following objectives may be
attained:
   (A)   Environmental design in the development of land that is better than
that normally attainable through the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance
subdivision regulations contained in this Chapter.
   (B)   Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the
relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures in
developments conceived as cohesive unified projects.
   (C)   Provision for functional aesthetic and beneficial use of open areas
for both public and private uses, including both active and passive forms of
recreation.
   (D)   Preservation of the natural environment and the conservation of
significant natural areas.
   (E)   Provision for a safe and desirable living environment for residential
areas characterized by a unified building and site development program.
   (F)   Provision for the unified development and redevelopment of business,
commercial, industrial and manufacturing centers while maintaining appropriate
buffers between such centers and adjacent residential areas through the
establishment of transitional uses and the use of landscaping and open areas.
   (G)   Rational and economic development on a scale consistent with the
Village's ability to provide needed public services. (Ord. 93-13, 8-10-1993)
10-13-2: PROCEDURE:
A planned unit development, if granted, shall be granted as a special use and
shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 18 of this Title, except that the
procedures described in this Chapter shall be the exclusive procedures for
processing applications seeking approval of a planned unit development. In the
event that a conflict arises between a provision of this Chapter and another
provision of this Title, or a provision of this Chapter and any other ordinance
of the Village, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
All applications for planned use development shall be made in accordance with
the following procedures and shall be accompanied by the required plats,
documents, detailed plans, drawings and other information as specified by this
Chapter 12.
   (A)   Pre-Application Conference: Prior to filing an application for a
planned unit development, the applicant may, but need not, request a pre-
application conference with the Zoning Board pursuant to the following
procedures:
      1.   The applicant shall request in a letter addressed to the Village
Board that a pre-application conference be scheduled with the Zoning Board.
      2.   The letter shall contain a brief description of the proposed
development including:

         (a)   The applicant shall present a brief description of the proposed
planned unit development to the Zoning Board.
         (b)   The Zoning Board shall review with applicant any plans, current
planning programs, other proposed land developments of the area surrounding the
proposed development, and the ordinances and policies of the Village relative
to the regulation of land development.
      5.   The conference shall be a public meeting and all members of the
Village Board and other boards and districts are encouraged to attend. The pre-
application conference may be held at either a regular or special meeting of
the Zoning Board.
   (B)   Application: Within twelve (12) months of the pre-application
conference, the applicant may file a petition and application for preliminary
plan approval which, once approved, will take the form of a special use permit
for a planned unit development. The procedures and requirements herein shall
govern the submission, review and approval of the application, notwithstanding
the regulations of Chapter 18 of the Zoning Ordinance as they pertain to
special uses generally. The application shall not be considered complete unless
it is accompanied by all documentation required by Section
10-13-4 of this Chapter and by payment of all required fees.
   (C)   Review Of The Preliminary Plan:
      1.   The Village shall send copies of the complete application to: a) its
planning consultant for review of the development plans; b) the Village
engineer to assess the impact of the proposed development on traffic in the
Village; and c) the Village attorney to review the application and all legal
documents.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application, the Zoning Board shall hold
a public meeting for the purpose of hearing a presentation by the petitioner of
the proposed planned unit development, subject to the following:
         (a)   The meeting may be either a regular meeting of the Zoning Board
or a special meeting called for the purpose of hearing the applicant's
presentation. The meeting shall not be considered a public hearing.
         (b)   Thirty (30) days' public notice of the time, place and subject
of the meeting shall be given. Other notice shall be sent to the Village Board.
         (c)   All documents required as part of the application shall be
displayed at the meeting.
   (D)   Public Hearing: Within sixty (60) days of the completion of the
foregoing presentation to the Zoning Board, the Zoning Board shall schedule a
public hearing as follows:
      1.   The hearing shall be before the Zoning Board, with the applicant
giving notice as provided by statute for special uses.
      2.   Any resident of the Village, and all others as provided by law,
shall have standing at the hearing and present testimony. All witnesses shall
be sworn.
      3.   The reports of any outside consultants, including those required in
subsection (C)1 above, shall be made a part of the record and shall be
available for inspection at the Village Hall prior to and at the time of the
hearing.
      4.   Both proponents and opponents of the petition, if represented by
counsel, shall be entitled to examine witnesses.
      5.   The hearing may be continued from time to time by agreement of the
parties and as provided by law.
      6.   A record of the hearing shall be made.
   (E)   Report To The Village Board: Within sixty (60) days of the completion
of the public hearing, the Zoning Board shall submit a written report to the
Village Board as follows:
      1.   The report shall contain findings of fact relative to the
conformance of the preliminary plan of the proposed planned unit development to
the objectives, purposes and requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
      2.   The report shall include a recommendation to the Village Board for
approval of the petition, approval subject to conditions or denial of the
petition.
      3.   If the report recommends approval subject to conditions, the
conditions of such recommendation shall be specified, including any variations
from the standards established by the Zoning Ordinance.
      4.   The report shall include, by reference, the reports of all outside
consultants and the record made of the hearing.
   (F)   Village Board Approval: Within sixty (60) days after receiving the
report from the Zoning Board, the Village Board may approve, modify or
disapprove the preliminary plan, or may refer the matter back to the Zoning
Board for further consideration. If the Village Board does not act finally on
the preliminary plan submission within sixty (60) days of its receipt of the
Zoning Board's report, the preliminary plan shall be deemed to have been denied
unless an extension is requested by the petitioner and granted by the Village
Board. In the case of approval, or approval with modifications, the Village
Board shall pass an ordinance granting the special use and amending the
Official Zoning Map of the Village. Approval of a preliminary plan shall not
constitute approval of the final plan and shall not entitle the applicant to a
building permit. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the
layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the preparation of the
final plan.
   (G)   Final Plans: Within one year of the approval of the preliminary plan,
the applicant shall file final plans with the Zoning Board as follows:
      1.   Final plans including engineering plans, phasing plans,
architectural plans, plats and surveys shall conform to the approved
preliminary plan.
      2.   Final plans may be submitted for portions of the development
provided that each stage shall contain a proportionate amount of any open
spaces, dedicated public lands or other amenities. The filing of final plans
for a stage of development in any year shall automatically extend the special
use permit for another year.
      3.   The Zoning Board shall review the final plans for conformance with
the approved preliminary plan and shall approve the final plan prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
   (H)   Amendments:
      1.   Preliminary plans may be amended at any time by filing a petition to
amend accompanied by only those documents which require changes due to the
amendment. Except as provided in the following subsection (H)2, an amendment
shall be subject to the same procedures as the preliminary plan application.
Amended portions of the planned unit development shall become a part of the
special use permit, pursuant to ordinance.
      2.   Due to fluctuations in the real estate market, the developer may
desire to vary architectural treatment or make minor changes in site planning.
The Zoning Board shall review such changes prior to accepting a plan for final
approval. If requested changes do not significantly alter the economic,
population or school impact data, and, if the changes are considered an
improvement to the plan, the final plan may be changed without requiring
further public hearings.
   (I)   Fees: The petitioner shall pay such fees as established by ordinance
of the Village, including fees to cover expenses incurred by the Village in
obtaining outside consultation in the review and plan documents as provided in
subsection (C)1 above. (Ord. 93-13, 8-10-1993)

10-16-5: STANDARDS:
   (A)   The Board shall not recommend a variation in the provisions of this
Title as authorized in this Chapter unless it shall have made findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in the following specific cases:
      1.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;
      2.   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; or
      3.   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
   (B)   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Board, in
making this recommendation whenever there are practical difficulties or
particular hardship, shall also take into consideration the extent to which the
following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the
evidence:
      1.   That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of the regulation were to be carried out;
      2.   That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable generally to the other property within the same zoning
classification;
      3.   That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
      4.   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property;
      5.   That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
      6.   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
   (C)   The Board may require such conditions and restrictions upon they
premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set forth in this Chapter to reduce or minimize the injurious effect
of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to implement the
general purpose and intent of this Title. (Ord. 61-56, 12-1961)

regulations;
   (B)   To permit the use of a lot not of record on the effective date of this
Title for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient width
and area of the lot, but in no event shall the width or area of the lot be less
than ninety percent (90%) of the required lot width or area; and
   (C)   To permit the same off-street parking spaces to qualify as required

10-18-1: PURPOSE:
The development and execution of the Zoning Title is based upon the division of
the Village into districts, within any one of which the use of land and
buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related to
the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
special uses which because of their unique character cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon public
need for the particular use of the particular location. Such special uses fall
into two (2) categories:
   (A)   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly-regulated utilities, or
uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
   (B)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities. (Ord. 61-56, 12-1961)

Board until after a public hearing has been held by the Plan Commission, after

Commission have been reported to the Village Board. (Ord. 61-56, 12-1961)

10-18-4: PROCESSING:
An application for a special use, in such form and accompanied by such
information as shall be established from time to time by the Plan Commission,
shall be filed with the Clerk and thereafter processed in the manner prescribed
heretofore for applications and amendments. (Ord. 61-56, 12-1961)
10-18-5: DECISIONS:
The Village Board, upon report and recommendation of the Plan Commission and
without further hearing, may authorize or deny an application for a special use
in accordance with the statutes of the State applicable to amendments, or may
refer it back to the Plan Commission for further consideration.
No special use shall be authorized by the Village Board unless the special use:
   (A)   Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location;
   (B)   Is so designed, located and proposed to be operated that the public
health, safety and welfare will be protected; and
   (C)   Would not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in
the neighborhood in which it is located. (Ord. 61-56, 12-1961)
10-18-6: CONDITIONS:
The Plan Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may provide, such
conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location and operation of a
special use, including, but not limited to, provisions for off-street parking
