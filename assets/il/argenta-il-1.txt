investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the
probable income to be derived.
   (B)   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be

   (A)   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the village, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on the
village strongly outweighs the public interest in the information. If the
village responds to a categorical request by stating that compliance would
unduly burden its operation, it shall do so in a writing signed by the Clerk
specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to
which compliance will so burden the operation of the village.
   (B)   After receipt of this response in writing, the person making the
request shall have an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable
proportions. If the person making the request fails to reduce the request to
manageable proportions, the response of the village shall be treated as a

that the village failed to respond within seven working days; and a written
statement setting forth the reasons the requestor believes the appeal should be
granted.
   (C)   The Village President shall respond in writing to an appeal within
seven working days of receipt thereof. Failure to respond shall be considered a
denial of the appeal. If the Village President denies an appeal in whole or in
part, the requestor shall be informed of his or her rights to judicial review
under this section.
(2001 Code, § 15-1-11)

IDENTITY THEFT POLICY
§ 31.75 BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the village, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is of significant concern to the village and can be reduced only
through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.
§ 31.76 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The village adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect
employees, customers, contractors and the village from damages related to the
loss or misuse of sensitive information.
   (B)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the village in compliance with state and federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
   (C)   This policy enables the village to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the village
from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the village:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
§ 31.77 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the village, including all
personnel affiliated with third parties.
§ 31.78 SENSITIVE INFORMATION POLICY.
   (A)   Definition of sensitive information.  Sensitive information includes
the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format:

         (b)   Credit card expiration date;
         (c)   Cardholder name; or
         (d)   Cardholder address.
      (2)   Tax identification numbers, including:
         (a)   Social Security number;
         (b)   Business identification number; or
         (c)   Employer identification numbers.
      (3)   Payroll information, including, among other information:
         (a)   Paychecks; or
         (b)   Pay stubs.

         (c)   Prescriptions; or
         (d)   Any related personal medical information.
      (6)   Other personal information belonging to any customer, employee or
contractor, examples of which include:
         (a)   Date of birth;
         (b)   Address;
         (c)   Phone numbers;
         (d)   Maiden name;
         (e)   Names; or
         (f)   Customer number.
      (7)   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Illinois Public Records Act and
the village's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the
sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he or she should contact
their supervisor. In the event that the village cannot resolve a conflict
between this policy and the Illinois Public Records Act, the village will
contact the Illinois Office of Open Records.
   (B)   Hard copy distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the village will comply with the following policies.
      (1)   Each cabinet, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
      (2)   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
      (3)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
      (4)   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, and the like in
common shared work areas will be erased, removed or shredded when not in use.
      (5)   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded they
will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical cross cut or Department of Defense (DOD)-approved shredding device.
Locked shred bins are labeled "Confidential paper shredding and recycling."
Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in accordance with the State
Local Records Commission retention policy.
   (C)   Electronic distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the village will comply with the following policies:
      (1)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an
electronic format.
      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail: "This message may contain
confidential and/or proprietary information and is intended for the person/
entity to which it was originally addressed. Any use by other is strictly
prohibited."
§ 31.79 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   If the village maintains certain covered accounts pursuant to federal
legislation, the village may include the additional program details.
   (A)   Covered accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there are a
reasonably foreseeable risk of the safety or soundness of the village from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation or
litigation risks.
   (B)   Red flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent it should
be investigated for verification.
         (a)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         (b)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         (c)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         (d)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer reporting agency as defined in § 334.82(b)
of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions Act.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         (a)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         (b)   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         (c)   A material change in the use of credit especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         (d)   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (C)   Suspicious documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the village, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (D)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the village. For example:
         (a)   The address does not match any address in consumer report;
         (b)   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is
listed on the Social Security Administrations Death Master File; or
         (c)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
the date of birth.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
village. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application.
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the village. For example:
         (a)   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
         (b)   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the village.
      (8)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
and the like), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot
provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be
available from a wallet or consumer report.
   (E)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the village receives a request for new, additional or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
         (a)   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
or
         (b)   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
      (6)   The village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
      (7)   The village is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in
connection with a customer's covered account.
      (8)   The village receives notice from customers, victims of identity
theft, law enforcement authorities or other persons regarding possible identity
theft in connection with covered accounts held by the village.
      (9)   The village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
law enforcement authority or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
§ 31.80 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (A)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the village
from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (B)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the village; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
§ 31.81 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (A)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be reevaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program are
up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (B)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (C)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new flags may also be appropriate.
   (D)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the village and its customers.
§ 31.82 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Involvement of management.
      (1)   The identity theft prevention program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The identity theft prevention program is the responsibility of the
governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented
and maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Village Clerk.
   (B)   Staff training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the village or its customers.
      (2)   The Village Clerk is responsible for ensuring identity theft
training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (C)   Oversight of service provider arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the village to ensure that the

   (A)   To the extent and as required by “An Act regulating wages of laborers,
mechanics and other workers employed in any public works by state, county, city
or any public body or any political subdivision or by anyone under contract for
public works,” approved June 26, 1941, as amended, the general prevailing rate
of wages in this locality for laborers, mechanics and other workers engaged in
construction of public works coming under the jurisdiction of the Village of
Argenta is hereby ascertained to be the same as the prevailing rate of wages
for construction work in the Macon County area as determined by the Department
of Labor of the State of Illinois as of June 2015, a copy of that determination
being attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. (Due to the State
Budget impasse, the Village of Argenta will reference the 2015 Prevailing Wage.
The Prevailing Wage will be updated with current information when it is
available from the State of Illinois.) The definition of any terms appearing in
the Ordinance which are also used in aforesaid Act shall be the same as in said
Act.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply said general
prevailing rate of wages as herein ascertained to any work or employment except
public works construction of the Village of Argenta to the extent required by
the aforesaid Act.
   (C)   The Village Clerk shall publicly post or keep available for inspection
by any interested party in the main office of the Village of Argenta, this
determination or any revisions of such prevailing rate of wage. A copy of this
determination or of the current revised determination of prevailing rate of
wages then in effect shall be attached to all contract specifications.
   (D)   The Village Clerk shall mail a copy of this determination to any
employer, and to any association of employers and to any person or association
of employees who have filed their names and addressees, requesting copies of
any determination stating the particular rates and the particular class of
workers whose wages will be affected by such rates.
   (E)   The Village Clerk shall promptly file a certified copy of Ordinance
16-06-20-03 with both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department
of Labor of the State of Illinois.

         (b)   Roll call;
         (c)   Pledge of allegiance;
         (d)   Recognition of visitors;

         (m)   Reconvene to open session (if necessary);
         (n)   Any discussion;
         (o)   Adjournment.
      (2)   All questions relating to the priority of business shall be decided
by the Chair without debate, subject to appeal.
   (B)   Duties of presiding officer. The presiding officer shall preserve
order and decorum and may speak to points of order in preference to other
Trustees, and shall decide all questions of order, subject to appeal.
   (C)   Duties of members. While the presiding officer is putting the
question, no member shall walk across or out of the Board chamber. Every
member, prior to his or her speaking, making a motion or seconding the same
shall not proceed with his or her remarks until recognized and named by the
Chair. He or she shall confine himself or herself to the question under debate,
avoiding personalities and refraining from impugning the motives of any other
Trustee's argument or vote.
   (D)   Visitors. No person other than a member of the Board of Trustees shall
address that body on the same question unless the person has been recognized by
the presiding officer.
   (E)   Presentation of new business. When a Trustee wishes to present a
communication, petition, order, resolution, ordinance or other original matter,
the member shall read the matter when reached in its proper order.
   (F)   Debate.
      (1)   No Trustee shall speak more than once on the same question, except
by consent of the presiding officer or unless three-fourths of the corporate
authorities agree that one's right to debate should be limited to speak only
once and then not until every other Trustee desiring to speak shall have had an
opportunity to do so; provided, however, that the proponent of the matter under
consideration, as the case may be, shall have the right to open and close
debate.
      (2)   No Trustee shall speak longer than ten minutes at any one time,
except by consent of the Village Board; and in closing debate on any question
as above provided, the speaker shall be limited to five minutes, except by
special consent of the Board.
      (3)   The Village Board, by motion, may limit debate. The presiding
officer shall have the right to participate in debate.
      (4)   While a member is speaking, no Trustee shall hold any private
discussion, nor pass between the speaker and the Chair.
   (G)   Call of Trustees to order. A Trustee, when called to order by the
Chair, shall thereupon discontinue speaking and take his or her seat and the
order or ruling of the Chair shall be binding and conclusive, subject only to
the right to appeal.
   (H)   Appeals from decision of the Chair.
      (1)   Any Trustee may appeal to the Board from a ruling of the Chair, and
if the appeal is seconded, the Trustee making the appeal may briefly state his
or her reason for the same, and the Chair may briefly explain his or her
ruling; but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other person shall
participate in the discussion. The presiding officer shall have the right to
participate in debate.
      (2)   The Chair shall then put the question, "Shall the decision of the
Chair be sustained?" If a majority of the Trustees present vote "No", the
decision of the Chair shall be overruled; otherwise, it shall be sustained.
   (I)   Question of personal privilege. The right of a member to address the
Board on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which
his or her integrity, character or motives are assailed, questioned or
impugned.
   (J)   Voting. Every other member who shall be present when a question is
stated from the Chair shall vote thereon, unless he or she is personally
interested in the question, in which case, he or she shall take whatever steps
are necessary to ensure that his or her vote is not taken.
   (K)   Special order of business. Any matter before the Village Board may be
set down as a special order of business at a time certain if two-thirds of the
Trustees present vote in the affirmative, but not otherwise.
   (L)   Seconding of motions required; written motions. No motion shall be put
or debated in the meeting or in committee unless it be seconded. When a motion
is seconded, it shall be stated by the presiding officer before debate, and
every motion in the Board, except motions of procedure, shall be reduced to
writing if required by a member, and the proposer of the motion shall be
entitled to the floor.
   (M)   Division of questions. If any question under consideration contains
several distinct propositions, the Trustees, by a majority vote of the Trustees
present may divide the question.
   (N)   Record of motions. In all cases where a resolution or motion is
entered in the journal, the name of the Trustee moving the same shall be
entered also.
   (O)   Announcement and changes of vote. The result of all votes by yeas and
nays shall not be announced by the Clerk, but shall be handed by him or her to
the Chairperson for announcement, and no vote shall be changed after the tally
list has passed from the hands of the Clerk.
   (P)   Precedence of motions.
      (1)   When a question is under debate, the following motions shall be in
order and shall have precedence over each other in order, as listed:
         (a)   To adjourn to a day certain;
         (b)   To adjourn;
         (c)   To take a recess;
         (d)   To lay on the table;
         (e)   The previous question;
         (f)   To refer;

      (2)   Divisions (P)(1)(b), (d) and (e) above to be decided without
debate.
   (Q)   Motions to adjourn.
      (1)   A motion to adjourn the Village Board shall always be in order,
except:
         (a)   When a Trustee is in possession of the floor;
         (b)   While the yeas and nays are being called;
         (c)   When the members are voting;
         (d)   When adjournment was the last preceding motion; and
         (e)   When it has been decided that the previous question shall be
taken.
      (2)   A motion simply to adjourn shall not be subject to amendment or
debate, but a motion to adjourn to a time certain shall be.
      (3)   The Village Board may, at any time, adjourn over one or more
regular meetings on a vote of a majority of all the Trustees authorized by law
to be elected.
   (R)   Previous question. When the previous question is moved on the main
question and seconded, it shall be put on this form: "Shall the main question
now be put?" If the motion be carried, all further amendments and all further
motions and debate shall be excluded, and the question put without delay upon
the pending amendment in proper order and then upon the main question.
   (S)   Motions to lay on the table and to take from the table.
      (1)   A motion simply to lay the question on the table shall not be
debatable, but a motion to lay on the table and publish or with any other
condition shall be subject to amendment and debate.
      (2)   A motion to take any motion or other proposition from the table may
be proposed at the same meeting at which the motion or proposition was laid
upon the table, provided two-thirds of the Trustees vote therefor.
      (3)   A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the table
shall apply to that motion or proposition only. An amendment to the main
question of other pending question may be laid on the table and neither the
main question nor the other pending question shall be affected thereby.
   (T)   Indefinite postponement; motion to defer or postpone without any
reference to time.
      (1)   When consideration of a motion or other proposition is postponed
indefinitely, it shall not be again taken up at the same meeting.
      (2)   A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question
to debate.
      (3)   A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall
not be construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered
to be of the same general nature and to possess the same general attributes so
far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to
a time certain.
   (U)   Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall take
precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.
   (V)   Motion to amend.
      (1)   A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to amend
an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained. An amendment modifying
the intention of a motion shall be in order; but an amendment relating to a
different subject shall not be in order.
      (2)   On an amendment to "Strike Out and Insert", the paragraph to be
amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be
stricken out, then those to be inserted, and finally, the paragraph as it will
stand if so amended shall be read.
      (3)   An amendment to the main question or other pending questions may be
referred to a committee and neither the main question nor the other pending
question shall be affected thereby.
   (W)   Filling of blanks. When a blank is to be filled and different sums or
times proposed, the question shall be taken first on the least sum or the
longest time.
   (X)   Motion to substitute. A substitute for any original proposition under
debate or for any pending amendment or the proposition may be entertained
notwithstanding that at such time, further amendment is admissible; and if
accepted by the Trustees by a vote shall entirely supersede the original
proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all amendments
appertaining thereto.
   (Y)   Reconsideration.
      (1)   A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same
meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A motion for
reconsideration having been once made and decided in the negative shall not be
renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered.
      (2)   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Trustees who
voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received
a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the
passage or adoption of the motion, then in that case, a motion to reconsider
may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on the
question to be reconsidered.
   (Z)   Adoption of "Robert's Rules of Order Revised". The rules of
parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published edition of "Robert's
Rules of Order Revised" shall govern the Board in all cases to which they are
applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the special rules of the
Board.
   (AA)   Temporary suspension of rules; amendment of rules. These rules may be
temporarily suspended by a vote of two-thirds of the corporate authorities
entitled by law to be elected and shall not be repealed, altered or amended,
unless by concurrence of two-thirds of all the corporate authorities entitled
by law to be elected.
   (BB)   Censure of Trustees; expulsion of Trustees. Any Trustee acting or
appearing in a lewd or disgraceful manner, or who uses opprobrious, obscene and
insulting language to or about any member of the Board, or who does not obey
the order of the Chair, shall be, on motion, censured by a majority vote of the
members present, or expelled by a two-thirds vote of all Trustees elected.

   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Board may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The member should notify the Village Clerk at least 48 hours before
the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can
be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result
in denial of a request for remote attendance.

she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability;

business of the village; or
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency.
   (C)   Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a quorum is
physically present, the presiding officer shall call for a motion that a member
may be permitted to attend the meeting electronically after specifying the
reason entitling the absent member to attend electronically. The motion must be
approved by a vote of a majority of the Board members present.
   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically
and other members of the Board must be able to communicate effectively, and
members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting
site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the Board shall
provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.

an off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if
the member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and
state specifically whether each member is physically present or present by
electronic means.
   (F)   Rights of remote member. A Board member permitted to attend
electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting
and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present,
subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and
adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and
counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending
electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote
counted and recorded by the Village Clerk and placed in the minutes for the
corresponding meeting. A member attending electronically may leave a meeting
and return as in the case of any member, provided the member attending

(2001 Code, § 36-3-10)
§ 35.65 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing,
through audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the
time frame otherwise indicated.
   (A)   Interest. The village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment or nonpayment of the tax to be 10% per
annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.
   (B)   Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
(2001 Code, § 36-3-11)
§ 35.66 ABATEMENT.
   The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any
late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the
local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or
failure to make a filing.
(2001 Code, § 36-3-12)
§ 35.67 INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14-day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
(2001 Code, § 36-3-13)
§ 35.68 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax
returns in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due
and owing.
   (B)   The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the reviewed
tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due and
owing.
      (1)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      (2)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
      (3)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax
return was filed by the taxpayer.
(2001 Code, § 36-3-14)
§ 35.69 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment form the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due.
   (B)   A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay
the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the
date of filing the application.
   (C)   A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be
liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
   (D)   The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

§ 35.70 PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.
   (A)   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal

   (A)   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
   (B)   Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is
valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect.
   (C)   If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax administrator
shall:
      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
      (2)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
      (3)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(2001 Code, § 36-3-17)
§ 35.72 APPLICATION.
   This subchapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement
all of the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this subchapter, this subchapter shall be
controlling.

obligation and service has again been obtained through subterfuge,
misrepresentation or fraud, that service shall be promptly disconnected and the
whole or a part of the advanced payment as may be necessary to satisfy the
unpaid obligation shall be retained by the village and credited to the

   (F)   Failure to receive bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a

   (G)   Request to discontinue service. Services shall have been deemed to

billing month in which the services are to be discontinued.
   (H)   Billing; utility shut-off.
      (1)   Billing. All water bills shall be mailed to users on or before the
first day of each month and shall be due and payable on the tenth day of such

date a penalty of 20% of the amount due on the bill.
      (2)   Disconnection for non-payment. Water service will be terminated 20
days after the due date for payment.
      (3)   Hearing. Any customer disputing the correctness of the water bill

they may be represented in person and/or by legal counsel of their choosing.
The customer may present orally or in writing their complaint and request for a
hearing on the correctness of the water bill to the Village Water Clerk. If a
hearing is requested as provided herein, the hearing shall be conducted by a
Hearing Officer as soon as practicable. The Hearing Officer shall be a designee
of the Board of Trustees. The Hearing Officer shall be authorized to order that
the customer service not be disconnected and shall have the authority to make a
final determination of the customer's complaint. Requests for delays or waiver
of payment will not be entertained at the hearing. Only questions of proper and
correct billing will be considered.

nonpayment of water bill is not the owner of record, then the village shall
also notify the record owner of the property by first class mail.

Department hours, Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
      (6)   Reconnection. When water service has to be reconnected for a new
customer, there shall be a $40 turn-on fee paid in advance.
      (7)   Change of occupancy. Any user requesting termination of services
shall give written notice to the village ten days prior to the time the
termination of service is desired. Responsibility for payment for water
services prior to the date of termination shall be with property owner as well
as the user. There shall be no charge for transferring the water service to the
subsequent user.
      (8)   Returned check. Any check written to the village that is returned
for non-sufficient funds will be charged a fee of $25 or be subject to shut-off
of water service.
   (I)   Lien notice.
      (1)   Whenever a bill for water service remains unpaid for 90 days after
it has been rendered, the Clerk shall file with the County Recorder of Deeds a
statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of
the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the
municipality claims a lien for this amount to the period covered by the bill.
If the consumer of water service whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the
premises and the Treasurer has notice of this, then notice shall be mailed to
the owner of the premises if his or her address is known to the Clerk whenever
the bill remains unpaid for a period of 60 days after it has been rendered.
      (2)   The failure of the Clerk to record the lien or to mail the notice,
or the failure of the owner to receive the notice, shall not affect the right
to foreclose the lien for unpaid water bills as mentioned herein.
   (J)   Foreclosure of lien.
      (1)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility charges may be sold
for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to
pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens. The foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in the name of the
village.

upon any public place to place and maintain barriers and warning devices
necessary for the safety of the general public.
   (A)   Barriers, warning signs and lights shall conform to the requirements

the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public. When traffic
conditions permit, the Street Superintendent may, by written approval, permit
the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a period of time
prescribed by him or her if, in his or her opinion, it is necessary. The
written approval may require that the permittee give notification to various
public agencies and to the general public. In those cases, the written approval
shall not be valid until the notice is given.

the instructions of the Street Superintendent.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-10)
§ 93.075 CLEARANCE FOR VITAL STRUCTURES.

vehicles and for pedestrians. If the street is not wide enough to hold the
excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, a passageway at
least one-half of the sidewalk width shall be maintained along the sidewalk
line.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-12)
§ 93.077 RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.

the written consent of the Street Superintendent and the owner of any facility.
If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility, this shall be done by
its owner. The facility owned by the village shall be moved to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of the work is borne by the permittee. The cost of
moving privately-owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee
unless other arrangements are made with the person owning the facility. The
permittee shall support and protect, by timbers or otherwise, all pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by
the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and
protect them under, over, along or across the work. The permittee shall secure
approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility.
   (B)   In case of any said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should
be damaged, and for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or devices
are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly
notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the
agency or person owning them and the expense of the repairs shall be charged to
the permittee. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall assume
all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to
anyone because of the facility damage and the assumption of liability is a
contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be those
instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning
utility. The village shall not be made a party to any action because of this
section. The permittee shall inform himself or herself as to the existence and
location of all underground facilities and protect the same against damage.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-13)
§ 93.078 ABANDONMENT OF SUBSTRUCTURES.
   Whenever the use of a substructure is abandoned, except the abandonment of
service lines designed to serve single properties, the person owning, using,
controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 30 days after the
abandonment, file with the Street Superintendent a statement in writing giving
in detail the location of the substructure so abandoned. If the abandoned
substructure is in the way or subsequently becomes in the way of an
installation of the village or any other public body, which installation is
pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove the abandoned
substructure or pay the cost of its removal during the course of excavation for
construction of the facility by the village or any other public body.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-14)
§ 93.079 PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.
   (A)   The permittee shall, at all times, and at his or her or its own
expense, preserve and protect from injury, any adjoining property by providing
proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where,
in the protection of the property, it is necessary to enter upon private
property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the
permittee shall obtain consent from the owner of the private property for that
purpose and if he or she cannot obtain the consent, the Street Superintendent
may authorize him or her to enter the private premises solely for the purpose
of making the property safe.
   (B)   At the permittee's own expense, all buildings, walls, fences or other
property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work shall
be shored up and protected, and the permittee shall be responsible for all
damage to public or private property or highways resulting from failure to
properly protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the
permittee to trench through any lawn area, that area shall be re-seeded or the
sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required in this subchapter.
   (C)   All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner
calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition
as nearly as possible to that which existed before the work began. The
permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist
in parking street areas without first obtaining the consent of the appropriate
village department or official having supervision of the property.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-15)
§ 93.080 PLACEMENT OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   (A)   All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench
or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as to eliminate
danger to those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the Street Superintendent shall have the
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then re-haul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
   (B)   All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the Street
Superintendent, whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or
to abate the dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the
Street Superintendent to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-16)
§ 93.081 CLEANUP.
   As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned
of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from that work.
All cleanup operations at the location of the excavation shall be accomplished
at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of
the Street Superintendent. From time to time as may be ordered by the Street
Superintendent and in any event, immediately after completion of the work, the
permittee shall, at his or her or its own expense, clean up and remove all
refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work and upon
failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the
Street Superintendent, the work may be done by the Superintendent and the cost
thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for
the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-17)
§ 93.082 PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES.
   The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full
depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of
the curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting street,
an adequate waterway shall be provided and at all times maintained. The
permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt,
slickings or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing
or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its
failure to so provide.
(2001 Code, § 33-4-18)

nature of the work or the condition of the street warrants. When required, the
depth of the cut shall not be less than one inch in depth; however, depths
greater than one inch may be required by the Street Superintendent when
circumstances warrant. Saw cutting may be required by the Superintendent
outside the limits of the excavation over cave-outs, overbreaks and small
floating sections.

§ 152.004 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this code is to regulate and control the division of
land within the plat approval jurisdiction of the village to prevent the
subdivision of land for uses to which the land is not suited and to regulate
the manner of subdivision so as to prevent serious hazards and problems to the
citizens of the community.
   (B)   Therefore, the regulations, requirements, standards, procedures,
specifications and controls contained herein are established in order to ensure
proper development of the village and to promote the public health, safety,
convenience, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of the community.
(2001 Code, § 34-1-4)
§ 152.005 INTENT.
   It is intended that this code establish regulations, requirements,
standards, procedure, specifications and controls specifically needed:
   (A)   To provide for the orderly division of land by requiring the proper
description, monumentation and recording of subdivided land;
   (B)   To establish what land areas are and are not eligible for division
into lots and to regulate uses of land to prevent land from being used for
purposes which the land is not suited;
   (C)   To provide for reasonable protection and conservation of those natural
resources (land, air, vegetation and water) upon which the contained
prosperity, safety, health and welfare of the community and surrounding region

   (D)   To secure adequate safeguards as part of the subdivision processes to
protect the general public from hazards of flooding, fire, overcrowding and
other problems which could endanger public health or safety;
   (E)   To secure adequate public convenience and safety through regulations
governing the installation, design and location of public streets;
   (F)   To ensure adequate provisions are made for adequate open space,
utilities and other public facilities deemed necessary for general public
health and convenience;
   (G)   To ensure proper development of the community by requiring subdivision
to be developed according to the requirement of all officially adopted village
plans and ordinances and in this respect to require dedication or reservation
of land necessary to comply with these documents;
   (H)   To protect the community's taxable resources by requiring that
subdivision be designed and developed so as not to impose excessive maintenance
burdens on the community, but still allowing for reasonable low development
costs for the developer and general home owners;
   (I)   To prevent scattered development beyond the reasonable service area of
community facilities and utilities; and
   (J)   To provide reasonable and equitable procedures and regulations for
handling all subdivision plats by providing uniform procedures and standards
for observance by both the approving authority and subdivider, and to do this
without causing unnecessary and unreasonable cost to the developer, village or
home owner.

(2001 Code, § 34-4-1)
§ 152.041 PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   The following steps set forth the pre-application conference and
investigation procedures in greater detail.
   (A)   Step One: Submittal.
      (1)   A subdivider wishing to arrange for pre-application hearings with
the Village Plan Commission shall submit a written request to the Plan
Commission for pre-application review for the proposed subdivision. The request
shall contain a general description of the location and size of the tract to be
platted; the intent as to character, type and use anticipated for the property
and type of structures to be developed; and in a general manner the extent and
character of the improvements to be made by the subdivider. If appropriate, a
description of any unique hardship or difficulty which might limit the
development of the property under consideration.
      (2)   The subdivider should also submit with the letter a location map
(see §§
152.055 through
152.061) of the property intended to be subdivided.
   (B)   Step Two: Establishment of Meeting Date and Classification.
      (1)   The Village Plat Officer shall then arrange with the Chairperson of
the Plan Commission to have a hearing date set within 30 days. The Chairperson
of the Plan Commission shall then notify the members of the Commission and
staff of the meeting date and a letter should also be sent to the subdivider
formally notifying subdivider of the time and place of the hearing.
      (2)   When the subdivider submits his or her letter to the Village Plat
Officer, the Village Plat Officer shall make a determination of what
classifications subdivision procedure the subdivider should follow and advise
the subdivider as to what additional information the subdivider should submit
to the Village Plan Commission.
      (3)   All lands to be subdivided within the village shall be classified
as one of the following four types of subdivision classifications, a major
subdivision, minor subdivision, special subdivision or replat.
   (C)   Step Three: Site Analysis (Major or Special Subdivisions).
      (1)   If the Village Plat Officer determines that land should be
processed as either a major subdivision or special subdivision the Plat Officer
should inform the subdivider that he or she will be required to submit a series
of maps for the purposes of site evaluations.
      (2)   Specific regulations as to how the maps should be drawn and how
technical information is to be presented is covered in §
152.057.
      (3)   In general, these maps should include:
         (a)   A map of general slope classification and topographic contours;
         (b)   A map of general drainage and high water marks;
         (c)   A map of significant vegetation;
         (d)   A map of general soil types; and
         (e)   In areas to be developed without community water or sewer
systems, tests for ground water supply availability and percolation information
may also be required.
   (D)   Step Four: The Neighborhood Plan and Site Recommendations (Major or
Special Subdivision).
      (1)   For all major subdivisions the Plan Commission staff shall direct
its staff to prepare a general neighborhood plan (Plate IV-I) for the pre-
application conference. The neighborhood plan should cover all areas within a
half a mile of the proposed tract or an area consistent with the standard
neighborhood limits within which the tract lies.
      (2)   This neighborhood plan should include major and collector street
alignments and widths; general location of minor streets; proposed drainage,
conservation and major utility easements; all proposed dedications and
reservations shown on the village's official comprehensive plan or official
map; and general development and design recommendations.
   (E)   Step Five: Site Discussions.
      (1)   The Plan Commission, staff, and subdivider at the pre-application
conference shall discuss the site analysis map and the general neighborhood
plan prepared by the staff. From this discussion the general design concepts
and development plan for the subdivision should be established.
      (2)   Further pre-application meetings may be required by the Commission
when, in the opinion of the Commission, additional site investigations are
necessary for proper review of a subdivision plat for the tract or tracts in
question.
   (F)   Step Six: Commission's Recommendations. Within 15 days after the pre-
application conference, the Commission shall submit to the developer and to the
Village Board in writing, its recommendations as to the development of the
site.
   (G)   Step Seven: Sketch Plan or Preliminary Plan (Optional).
      (1)   In cases of all minor and replats a sketch plan shall be required
and shall be presented at the pre-application conference. In the cases of
special subdivisions or major subdivisions, a submission of a sketch plan is at
the discretion of the subdivider.
      (2)   Where the subdivider feels he or she fully understands the
recommendations of the Plan Commission he or she may proceed to the preliminary
plat sketch without a sketch plan.
      (3)   If the subdivider feels unclear or disagrees with the
recommendations of the Plan Commission he or she may submit a sketch plan in
accordance with regulations of §§
152.055 through
152.061 for further discussion with the Plan Commission and Village Board prior
to his or her engaging in more expensive engineering drawings.
(2001 Code, § 34-4-2)
§ 152.042 FORMAL PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLATS.
   After the subdivider has satisfied the pre-application requirements of this
code (§
152.040 above) and after the Plan Commission has concurred with the decision of
the Plat Officer as to the proper classification of the proposed subdivision,
the subdivider then shall proceed to process his or her plat in accordance with
the appropriate classification procedures established by this subchapter. The
following sections, therefore, set the appropriate procedural requirements for
minor subdivisions, replats, major subdivisions or special subdivisions.
   (A)   The minor subdivision.
      (1)   The minor subdivision procedures shall be allowed when in the
determination of the Plan Commission five lots or less will be created; the
subdivision fronts on an existing adequately improved street; does not involve
any new streets; easements of access or the extension of other municipal
facilities; does not adversely affect the development of the remainder of the
parcel or adjoining property; and does not conflict with any provisions of the
official map or other applicable regulations or plans.
      (2)   After the Plan Commission approves the classification of the
proposed subdivision as a minor plat it shall be processed in one step in
accordance with the following procedures:
         (a)   The subdivider shall prepare a certified survey map in
accordance with the regulations set forth in the code in §
152.059 below; and shall file the original linen or Mylar and seven copies of
the map and the letter of application with the Plan Commission, who within a
period of 30 days shall approve, conditionally approve or reject the plat.
         (b)   Before approving or rejecting any plat the Plan Commission shall
submit one copy of the certified survey map to each of the utilities companies
to ascertain whether any utilities easements are required; and one copy to the
tax officer to ascertain whether there are any unpaid taxes. These agencies
within seven days should return their comments. If no answer is received within
15 days it shall be considered that there are no objections to the plat. If the
Commission rejects the subdivision its objections shall be in writing.
         (c)   When a minor subdivision is considered by the Plan Commission,
the Chairperson of the Plan Commission shall sign the plat and within 15 days
submit the original linen and all copies, bearing his or her name, date and
recommendation to the Village Board for final action.
   (B)   Major subdivision. The processing of a subdivision as a major
subdivision shall be required on any parcel of ground not previously platted,
where major street improvements, easements or dedications are required, or
where more than five lots are being created through the subdivision processes.
The major subdivision shall be processed in three steps: the preliminary plat
stage, the construction and inspection stage and the final plat stage. The
following sections set the proper procedures to be followed in each of the
three stages mentioned. A review and approval of each of these stages will be
necessary before the subdivider will be entitled to proceed to the following
stage.
      (1)   Preliminary or tentative plat.
         (a)   A preliminary plat shall be eligible for review when the
subdivider has satisfied the pre-application requirements of this code, when he
or she has paid his or her plat fees and when he or she has submitted to the
Plat Officer (Building Inspector) ten copies of the layout plat, three copies
of the engineering drawings, plus three copies of the proposed deed
restrictions to be established for the proposed lots.
         (b)   The Plat Officer shall notify the Chairperson of the Plan
Commission and a public hearing shall be set within 30 days to review the
preliminary plat, engineering drawings and suggested deed restrictions. The
subdivider also shall be given adequate written notice of meeting. The copies
of the proposed preliminary plat should then be sent to the County Health
Department, appropriate drainage districts, the township board, appropriate
planning staff of the Village Plan Commission, the electric company, the
telephone company, the School Board, and the Village Engineer 15 days prior to
the public hearing. Comments from these agencies should be submitted to the
Village Plan Commission prior to the public hearing. If no comment is received
by the time of the meeting the Commission shall consider the agencies have no
recommendations.
         (c)   At the public hearing the Plan Commission shall recommend
approval, conditional approval or rejection of the proposed plat. Copies of the
recommendation of the Plan Commission and the original linen copy of the plat
shall then be sent to the Village Board and additional copies of the village
action should be sent to the subdivider.
         (d)   After receiving the recommendations of the Village Plan
Commission the village shall act upon the proposed plat within 60 days. If
approved the President of the village shall sign and date the original and
three copies of the plat and also direct the Chairperson of the Plan Commission
to sign and date the plats.
      (2)   Inspection and work certification. Upon approval of the preliminary
plat the subdivider shall meet with the Building Inspector to receive approval
to start work on the public improvement within the subdivision and during
construction shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   The subdividing contractor shall be duly certified and bonded by
the village to undertake the work. In the event that the contractor is required
to post his or her bond, the bond should be drawn in accordance with
regulations in village codes;
         (b)   The subdivider shall also submit to the Village Engineer
certifications showing the type materials and amounts used in construction meet
the standard of this code;
         (c)   The subdivider shall also arrange for various inspections of
improvements to be made by the Village Engineer or Inspector at pre-arranged
points during the course of construction as provided for in this code;
         (d)   The design engineer shall also be required to inspect work to
ensure that it conforms to the specifications in the preliminary plat and upon
the works completion shall certify that the work has been completed according
to the engineering and design plans as approved by the village; and
         (e)   Upon proper completion of improvements the Village Engineer or
Inspector shall submit to the Village Board a full report (including an
inspection certification (see §§
152.055 through
152.061) on improvements and certifications thereof. If the engineer finds that
all improvements are installed to the standards agreed upon in the preliminary
plat or if a bond in proper legal form has been submitted (the Village Board,
however, shall not formally accept any dedicated streets until one year after
actual construction, the maintenance during this time shall be the subdivided
responsibility) the development is ready for final platting.
      (3)   The final plat.
         (a)   The final plat shall be ready for review after the Building
Inspector notifies the Chairperson of the Plan Commission that the work has
been completed or adequate bonds have been accepted by the village. The
subdivider shall prepare a final plat and a letter of application in accordance
with this code and shall file five copies of the plat with the Village Building
Inspector.
         (b)   The Village Plan Commission shall then examine the final plat
for its conformance with: the approved preliminary plat; any conditions of
approval of the preliminary plat; the regulations of this code and all other
village ordinances. The Commission then should recommend approval, conditional
approval or rejection of the plat to the Village Board. The Village Board
should act within 60 days on the plat.
      (4)   Recordation. After the final plat has been approved and required
improvements either installed or sureties insuring their installation provided,
the Village Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting
to the approval to be duly executed and the Village Clerk shall record the plat
with the County Register of Deeds. The Register of Deeds cannot record the plat
unless it is offered within 30 days from the date of the last approval.
   (C)   The replat procedures. The replat procedures shall apply when an
alteration, redesign or re-division is proposed for an existing legally
recorded subdivision or part thereof. The replace procedures may be processed
in one or two steps depending upon whether or not it is necessary to vacate or
alter any streets, easements, lots or other public facilities. In the instance
where no public facilities, easements, lot records or other improvements are
involved and where the plan change corresponds with the provisions of the
village comprehensive plan the further subdivision or other alteration of lots
in existing subdivisions shall follow the same procedures as described under a
minor subdivision; in all other instances involving subdivisions classified as
replats the original plat must be vacated according to the following section.
      (1)   Vacation of existing plat. Any person, firm or agent thereof
wishing to have vacated existing lot lines, public streets, highways or alleys
or any easement other than easements granted between individual property owners
shall file a written instrument and plat with the village officials showing
what easements and rights-of-way are to be vacated. Such an instrument and
replat shall be reviewed by the Plan Commission, the County Superintendent of
Highways, the District Engineer of the Department of Public Works and Buildings
of the state and the effected utility companies. The Village Plan Commission
after receiving the comments of these agencies shall make their recommendations
on the plat to the Village Board. If the Village Board concurs with the
vacation, the Village Clerk shall submit the resolution of the Village Board,
the instrument and plat to the County Recorder of Deeds; who then shall
officially record and cancel the entire plat of record or specific portions
thereof.
      (2)   Review of plat. After a vacation of a previous plat has been
approved by the Village Board and recorded in the office of the Macon County
Recorder of Deeds, the subdivider may then submit his or her petition for the
replat of the subdivision involved. The subdivision shall be classified by the
Village Building Inspector as either major, minor or special subdivision and
shall then proceed in accordance with the regulations established for the
classification given to the subdivision.
   (D)   Special subdivisions or planned unit development.
      (1)   Any parcel of land five acres or more can be considered for a
special subdivision when both the subdivider and the Village Plan Commission
concur in the pre-application conference that the land can best be developed as
a planned unit development or a special subdivision.
         (a)   The Plan Commission shall approve the planned development only
if it finds that the planned development satisfies all of the following
standards.
            1.   The planned development is consistent with the comprehensive
plan for the community.
            2.   The planned development is an effective and unified treatment
of the development possibilities on the project site (and the development plan
makes appropriate provision for the preservation of streams and stream banks,
wooded cover, rough terrain and similar areas).
            3.   The planned development shall be in harmony with any existing
or proposed development in the area surrounding the project site.
            4.   The approval of the plan will not represent an increased
maintenance burden on roads, drainage ways and public utilities to the village,
township or county over what these agencies would have to incur if the
subdivision was developed as a standard subdivision.
         (b)   Upon classification of any plat as a special subdivision or
planned unit development by the Plan Commission the subdivider is then eligible
to submit to the Village Building Inspector a letter requesting joint zoning
and subdivision action.
            1.   This letter should also contain an outline of the development
proposals and a copy of a planned development plat drawn in accordance with the
standards in §§
152.055 through
152.061.
            2.   The Building Inspector shall arrange to have a joint meeting
of the Plan Commission and Zoning Board within 30 days of submission of the
plat and give notice to the subdivider of the time and place of the meeting.
         (c)   Except for the granting of special relief, legal notification
and the combined action of the Zoning Board and Plan Commission; the plat shall
then be processed similarly to that of a major plat. (All planned unit
developments must be approved by two-thirds vote of the members present at any
Village Board meeting.)
            1.   Since special subdivisions combine zoning with subdivision
procedures, all hearings shall comply with publication requirements of the
state for zoning hearings.
            2.   There should be therefore a 15-day legal publication given in
advance of a public meeting where special subdivisions are to be reviewed.
      (2)   The Building Inspector, when certifying the work of the planned
unit development, special plat or when issuing building permits for the same,
shall only be allowed to issue permits consistent with the detailed plans shown
on the plat. No building permits may be issued on land with the planned
development subdivision until the final plan for development has been approved.
      (3)   The final plat shall be processed similarly to that of a major
subdivision.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 152.075 CONFORMITY TO PLANS.
   All subdivisions shall be designed to conform to all officially adopted
plans of the village.
(2001 Code, § 34-6-1)
§ 152.076 CONFORMITY TO NATURAL FEATURES.
   (A)   All subdivisions and all areas contained herein shall be so planed to
take advantage of the natural topography of the land so as to economize the
construction of streets and drainage systems; to reduce the overall amount of
grading and disruption of the topsoil and natural vegetation, and to prevent
disruption of surrounding drainage and natural environmental conditions.
   (B)   The village reserves the authority to deny or require modification of
any subdivision or part thereof which because of its natural characteristics or
position cannot afford a reasonable\y pleasant, safe and healthy location for
residents or commercial activities.
   (C)   Some conditions which would make land unsuited for lotting or
development are as follows:
      (1)   Lands lying within, or at less than one vertical foot above the
maximum probable flood level, or where the levels are not available at least
two feet above the greatest flood of record. Filling of stream basins shall
only be allowed when it will have no impedance on natural flood flows and only
by special permit of the Village Board.
      (2)   Land areas with very severe limitations which include limitations
of high permanent water tables, swamps, highly organic soils, and soils subject
to overflows, soils subject to extreme erosion, and soils which in other ways
present hazards to construction.
      (3)   In subdivisions planned for development with individual septic
systems areas with soils having a high seasonal water table, slow or excessive
permeability, and soils subject to excessive frost action.
      (4)   Lands lying on a general overall slope of 25% or more shall be
excluded from development. Lands lying on more than 12% slope shall not be used
for lots which must depend on septic systems for waste disposal.
      (5)   Land proposed to be developed on dependent or individual water
systems which cannot show after reasonable investigations that ground water
adequate to meet the population needs of the subdivision supplies are not
approved.
(2001 Code, § 34-6-2)
§ 152.077 MODIFICATIONS FOR UNSUITABLE SITES.
   (A)   The village also reserves the right to deny platting or require
modifications such as increases in lot size, setback, street locations or the
dedication of open space easements or screening for land areas located adjacent
to facilities or activities which might effect the public health, safety or
general welfare for adjacent residential lots.
   (B)   The following list, which is by no means inclusive, represent some
conditions which might require action by the village.
      (1)   Areas adjacent to heavy industry or rail facilities. (This might
require separation by easement, increased setback from streets or screening.)
      (2)   Lots along major highways. (This might require additional setbacks
or may require frontage roads.)
(2001 Code, § 34-6-3)
§ 152.078 STREET ARRANGEMENT.
   (A)   In any new subdivision the street layout shall conform to the
arrangement width and location of streets as indicated on the village official
map, comprehensive plan, or the neighborhood development plan which was drawn
up as part of the pre-application review.
   (B)   The overall plan in addition should conform to the following
standards:
      (1)   In general, not more than 20% of the total land area of the
subdivision should be in street right-of-way;
      (2)   The resulting street pattern should be properly related to
topography and other natural features for aesthetic and drainage reasons.
Further, the system should be so designed as to allow economic platting of the
best building sites possible;
      (3)   The overall plan should result in proper functional classification
of streets, with spacing of collector and major streets in accordance with
standards contained in this section; and
      (4)   The street system should afford satisfactory access to a public
street to all building lots within the subdivision and provide the advantageous
street service up to all adjoining lands.
(2001 Code, § 34-6-5)
§ 152.079 STREET ALIGNMENT.
   (A)   Street alignment shall be so laid out so as to ensure public safety
and convenience for both vehicular and pedestrian travel.
   (B)   The following standard shall be followed in the alignment of streets.
      (1)   The number of intersections shall be kept to the absolute minimum
necessary to provide reasonable direct traffic flow. No more than two streets
shall converge at any one intersection. The intersection of streets shall be as
near 90% as possible, never less than 70%.
      (2)   Street jogs shall be discouraged and should never be permitted with
centerline offset of less than 150 feet.
      (3)   Reverse curves of major and collector streets shall not have
tangents of less than 100 feet.
      (4)   The number of access points shall be reduced as the functional
classification of the street increases and as travel volume and speed
increases.
(2001 Code, § 34-6-6)
§ 152.080 SPECIFIC STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   The design of streets shall relate to their function classification,
surrounding development density and topography. Major streets shall be designed
in accordance with anticipated traffic flow and desired speed of movement, all
major widths and standards of construction shall be separately approved by the
Village Board after recommendation of the Village Plan Commission and Engineer.
   (B)   The design of the residential streets and collector streets should
conform to the standards of Tables
VI-I,
VII-I (both tables found in §
152.082(A)(7)) and the general standards contained in this section related to
the streets.
(2001 Code, § 34-6-7)
§ 152.081 LOCAL OR RESIDENTIAL STREETS.
   (A)   Local streets shall be designed in accordance with Tables
VI-I and
VII-I (in §
152.082(A)(7)).
   (B)   The function of local streets is to provide direct access to
individual lots.
   (C)   The travel speed should be slow enough to minimize hazards to children
and entering traffic (less than 30 mph).
   (D)   The following standards shall relate to local streets:
      (1)   Local streets shall be so laid out that through traffic is
discouraged; and
      (2)   Local streets should be kept as short as possible and connect as
directly as possible into a collector street.
(2001 Code, § 34-6-8)
§ 152.082 COLLECTOR STREETS.
   (A)   Collector streets shall be designed and laid out in accordance to
Tables
VI-I and
VII-I (both found in §
152.082).
   (B)   The function of collector streets is to collect local traffic and move
it conveniently and directly to the nearest major streets or neighborhood
facilities (schools, churches, shopping and the like).
   (C)   The access to a collector street should be limited to local streets.
The design travel speed for collector streets shall be between 30 to 40 mph.
   (D)   The specific requirements are as follows.
      (1)   Collectors should be spaced approximately one-fourth a mile apart.
      (2)   Residential driveways generally should not be allowed to enter
directly onto collector streets.
      (3)   Collector streets shall be provided with ten-foot crosswalks at
reasonable intervals.
      (4)   Setback on all collector streets shall be increased over minimum
zoning district setbacks in relation to the traffic volume anticipated.
      (5)   Four-foot sidewalks shall be required at least on one side of urban
collector streets, and where required by the corporate authority may be
required on both sides.
      (6)   Where parking and driveway entrances are necessary along collector
streets the pavement width shall not be less than 40 feet. Where no lots face
collector streets, the pavement width may be reduced to 36 feet or less,
depending on the density of adjoining development.
      (7)   Access controls may be required on highly traveled collectors.

§ 152.182 STORM DRAINAGE.
   The subdivider shall design and construct a storm drainage system adequate
to handle maximum potential flows of water drainage from the subdivision or
passing through the subdivision without causing hazard for life or property
within the subdivision or surrounding land areas. All storm systems shall be
designed and constructed according to the preliminary plat and shall consider
the appropriate streets, storm sewers, roadway ditches, grassed swales, natural
watercourses, catch basins and inlets, as may be required. All the facilities
should be complimentary in design and construction. In general all areas shall
be required to install storm sewers.
   (A)   Natural watercourse.
      (1)   Whenever practical, natural open drainage ways shall be utilized as
part of the subdivision storm drainage system.
      (2)   Whenever a natural stream or other human-made important surface
drainage course or agricultural drainage tiles are located within a
subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate an adequate easement along each side
of the stream or tile for purposes of widening, deepening, sloping, improving
or protecting the stream or tile for drainage or flood water retention.
      (3)   The filling, alteration, widening or any other restriction or
alteration of a natural stream and flood basin shall be permitted only as shown
and approved on the preliminary plat. In areas where stream slopes exceed 12%,
the slopes shall either be graded, stabilized by riprapping, or some sort of
planting or shall be dedicated as a natural easement.
   (B)   Drainage ditches and swales. Where roadway ditches or swales are
permitted the ditches or swales shall be contained within easements at least
ten feet wide and the drainage shall be improved as follows:
      (1)   With grades to 4%, ditches may have sod bottoms and banks;
      (2)   With grades from 4% to 8%, ditches or swales must have ditch
checks;
      (3)   With greater than 8% grades, ditches or swales must have riprap or
be paved;
      (4)   The filling, alteration, widening or any other restriction or
alteration of a roadway ditch or swale shall not be permitted without prior
written approval of the Village Board; and
      (5)   No shrubbery, fence or other such structure shall be planted or
constructed in or over any drainage ditch or swale in such a manner which would
impede the flow of water and storm run-off through these ditches and swales.
   (C)   Storm drainage structures.
      (1)   Culverts; when allowed, pipe culverts may be used. The minimum
length of culverts shall be at least equal to the distance from edge of
shoulder to edge of shoulder, plus six times the vertical distance from the
edge of should to the flow line of the culvert. No culvert shall have a
diameter of less than 12 inches. In no case shall driveway culverts be less
than 20 feet in length.
      (2)   Bridges. All bridges and culverts having a span of more than ten
feet shall be approved by the Bridge Engineer, Department of Public Works and
Buildings, Division of Highway of the state.
      (3)   Storm sewers. The sewer system shall be designed by the rational
method, with self-cleaning velocities as follows (see §
152.137 above):
         (a)   The part of the system which serves as main or terminal
collectors shall be of sufficient capacity to carry the maximum storm water
flows which may occur in a ten-year period.
         (b)   The part of the system which serves as lateral collectors, and
which can readily be augmented by future additions, shall be of sufficient
capacity to carry maximum storm water flows which may occur in a five-year
period.
         (c)   The engineer shall select coefficients of run-off based on the
types of development anticipated in all parts of the watershed affecting the
drainage structure. Information regarding future development of the watershed
shall be obtained from the Planning Director.
         (d)   The system shall include all necessary appurtenances such as
inlets, catch basins and manholes as may be required for proper operation and
maintenance. The sizing of the structures and spacing should provide that
encroachment into the street not exceed eight feet from the back curb, and that
the head on top of the grate be no higher than the top of the curb or six
inches, whichever is the least dimension.
         (e)   Where the main storm sewer serving a subdivision can be expected
to carry a substantial amount of storm water from adjoining lands higher in the
drainage area, and where the run-off from these lands can be expected to
increase in the future because of more intense development, the developer may
be permitted to substitute for the sewer an open ditch. The ditch shall comply
with grading, seeding and sodding specifications of this code, and the ditch
shall be located on a drainage easement of sufficient width to permit its
proper maintenance and to allow the eventual construction of an underground
storm sewer adequate to serve the entire drainage area above the subdivision.
         (f)   All storm sewers shall be at least 12 inches in diameter and
shall be of material and construction approved by the Village Engineer.
         (g)   All materials for the construction of bridges, culverts, storm
sewers, catch basins, manholes, inlets and other facilities shall be approved
by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Oversized storm sewers. If greater than 24-inch diameter sewers are
required to handle the contemplated flows, the cost of the larger sewers shall
be shared between the developer and the village. The developer shall be
responsible for the cost of furnishing and installing a sewer of an appropriate
size for his or her development, and the village will be responsible for the
incremental increase in cost to install the larger sewer.
      (5)   Underdrain system for sump pump discharge. Whenever natural
topography does not allow the flow of ground water from individual sump pumps
to be directly discharged into a natural watercourse, the developer shall
provide an underdrain system at curb side to provide an outlet for the
discharges. The drain system shall consist of a six-inch rigid PVC pipe,
constructed in a trench immediately behind the curb. The pipe shall be laid to
a minimum depth of three feet six inches from top of pipe of top of curb. The
trench shall be backfilled with aggregate to the bottom of the curb. Pipe and
aggregate backfill shall be in accordance with the applicable provision of §
607 of the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, State of
Illinois. Each lot will be provided with a two- inch riser pipe for future
connection of a sump pump discharge line. Each riser's location shall be duly
noted on record drawings provided by the developer.

well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter. In order to
minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance
issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-
floodproofed.
      (1)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      (2)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      (3)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with §
155.07 of this chapter.
      (4)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with §
155.07 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      (5)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with §
155.07 of this chapter.
      (6)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in accordance with §
155.07(B) of this chapter.
      (7)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of §
155.06 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      (8)   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.

§ 155.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the Village of Argenta or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 11-06-06-07, passed 6-6-2011)
§ 155.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Board of
Trustees of the Village of Argenta to fulfill the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program including: June 16, 2011. However, this chapter does
not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility
in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 11-06-06-07, passed 6-6-2011)
§ 155.14 SEVERABILITY.

WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS
§ 156.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to further the goals and objectives of the
Village of Argenta in promoting the use of wind as an alternative energy
source. This section regulates the siting, installation, and operation of wind
energy systems to allow the effective and efficient use of wind resources while
protecting the health, safety, and welfare of nearby residents and the general
public.

§ 156.02 WIND ENERGY SYSTEM DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this subchapter:
   AMBIENT SOUND. The all-encompassing sound at a given location, usually a
composite of sounds from many sources near and far. For the purpose of this
section, the AMBIENT SOUND LEVEL shall mean the quiescent background level,
that is, the quietest of ten-second average sound levels measured when there
are no nearby or distinctly audible sound sources. Daytime ambient measurements
should be made during mid-morning, weekday hours while nighttime measurements
should be made after midnight.
   ANEMOMETER TOWER. A temporary wind speed indicator constructed for the
purpose of analyzing the potential for utilizing a wind energy system at a
given site. This includes the tower, base plate, anchors, cables and hardware,
wind direction vanes, booms to hold equipment, data logger, instrument wiring,
and any telemetry devices that are used to monitor or transmit wing
characteristics over a period of time for either instantaneous wind information
or to characterize the wind resource at a given location.
   ARGENTA ZONING JURISDICTION. The unincorporated territory lying within one
and one-half miles of the corporate limits of the Village of Argenta, excluding
the areas located within the zoning jurisdiction of another municipality.
   HORIZONTAL-AXIS WIND TURBINE. A tower-mounted turbine in which the rotor is
mounted horizontally.
   ROTOR. The rotating part of a wind turbine, including the blades and blade
assembly or the rotating portion of the generator.
   ROTOR DIAMETER. The diameter of the circle swept by the rotor. For
measurement purposes, this means the distance from the outer-most tip of the
blade to the center of the turbine rotor multiplied by two.
   SHADOW FLICKER. A repetitive oscillation of light and shadow cast when light
passes through and is interrupted by moving wind turbine blades.
   SOUND LEVEL. The A-weighted sound pressure level in decibels (dB) (or the C-
weighted level if specified) as measured using a sound level meter that meets
the requirements of a Type 2 or better precision instrument according to the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) SI.4. The "average" sound level is
time-averaged over a suitable period using an integrating sound level meter
that meets the requirements of ANSI S12.43.
   SYSTEM HEIGHT. The vertical distance measured from the finished grade at the
foot of the system to the outer-most tip of the rotor when the tip is at its
highest point.
   TOWER-MOUNTED WIND TURBINE. A wind turbine mounted on a structure that is
designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of elevating and supporting
a wind generator, including freestanding lattice towers, monopole towers or
guyed towers.
   VERTICAL-AXIS WIND TURBINE. A wind turbine in which the rotor is mounted
vertically.
   WIND ENERGY SYSTEM (or SYSTEM). A wind turbine and all directly supporting
components, including any base, blade, foundation, generator, nacelle, rotor,
tower, transformer, vane, wire, inverter, and batteries.
   WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, BUILDING-MOUNTED. A relatively small wind turbine and
components mounted on a building and which generates power for on-site use.
   WIND-ENERGY SYSTEM, ON-SITE. A wind energy system that is incidental and
subordinate to and which generates power for the principal use of the zoning
lot on which it is situated. A wind energy system is considered on-site even if
excess electricity is used by the utility company in exchange for a reduction
in the cost of electrical power supplied by that company.
   WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, PRE-EXISTING. Any wind energy system which is
operational on the effective date of this section.
   WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, SERVICE AREA. A wind energy system intended to provide
power to a small grouping of uses within a single zoning district.
   WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, UTILITY.

§ 156.11 MAINTENANCE.
   All wind energy systems shall be maintained in good condition and in safe
working order throughout the life of the system. If the system is not
maintained in operational condition and/or poses a potential safety hazard, the
owner shall immediately correct the situation at their expense. Any wind energy
system found to be unsafe by the Zoning Administrator or appointed designee,
must stop operation immediately upon notification, if the owner fails to
correct the unsafe condition, the Zoning Administrator may remove or cause to
be removed, altered or repaired an unsafe wind energy system immediately and
without notice, if, in his/her opinion, the condition of the system is such as
to present an immediate threat to the safety of the public. If a wind energy
system remains inoperable for a period of 180 days, it shall be deemed
abandoned and the procedures under § 156.13 applied.
(Ord. 23-11-20 Ord03, passed 11-20-2023)
§ 156.12 VIOLATION.
   Should a wind energy system or any part thereof violate the requirements of
this subchapter, the owner shall cease operations immediately. Upon receipt of
a complaint or the notice of a complaint from the owner, the Zoning
Administrator shall make a determination as to whether there is a violation
requiring the immediate cessation of operation. The system may resume operation
once the violation(s) have been remedied.
(Ord. 23-11-20 Ord03, passed 11-20-2023)
§ 156.13 ABANDONMENT AND REMOVAL.
   A wind energy system shall be deemed abandoned it not functioning for a
continuous period of 180 days, and there is no demonstrated plan to restore the
equipment to operating condition. The village will issue a Notice of
Abandonment for the removal of an abandoned wind energy system as follows:
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a Notice of
Abandonment to the owner of a wind energy system that is deemed to be
abandoned, and in cases where immediate safety is not of concern, the owner
shall have 30 days from Notice receipt date to respond.
   (B)   Following the 30-day response period, and if the Zoning Administrator
determines that the system remains abandoned, the owner of the system shall
remove the abandoned system at their expense within 180 days of the original
Notice of Abandonment. A demolition permit shall be obtained for the removal of
the abandoned system.
   (C)   Failure to remove the abandoned system within said 180 days
constitutes a violation of this section. Following said 180 days, the village,
or a contractor hired by the village, shall have the authority to enter the
subject property and cause removal of the system at the owner's expense. In the
case of such removal the village may file a lien for reimbursement, of any and
all expenses incurred by the village without limitation, including attorney
fees and accrued interest. For those cases in which the owner of a wind energy
system is not the owner of land on which the system is located, the village may
execute the bond posted at the time of approval of the system.
(Ord. 23-11-20 Ord03, passed 11-20-2023)

section, it shall not be altered, enlarged, extended or relocated such that the
nonconformity of the system is increased.
   (D)   Pre-existing wind energy systems that are substantially damaged or
destroyed must be rebuilt to conform to this section.

BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS
§ 156.50 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to further the goals and objectives of the
Village of Argenta in prohibiting the construction, installation, and operation
of battery energy storage systems within the corporate limits of the village in
order to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of village
residents and the general public. Specifically, the Village Board of Trustees
has determined that the proximity of the village's residential zoning districts
to any potential site for the construction, installation, and operation of
battery energy storage systems does not allow for safe operation within the
village. Further, the Village Board of Trustees has determined that risk of
fire, casualty, property damage, and personal injury to village residents from
the construction, installation, and operation of battery energy storage systems
outweighs any potential public benefit.
(Ord. 25-04-21 Ord02, passed 4-21-2025)
§ 156.51 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM ("BESS"). An energy storage system that can
store and deploy generated energy, typically a group of batteries that charge
(i.e., collect energy) and store electrical energy from the grid or energy
generation facility and then discharge that energy at a later time to provide
electricity or other grid services when needed. BESS generally consists of
batteries, battery storage containers, racking systems, on-site switchyards,
inverters, associated interconnection transmission lines, and supervisory
control and data acquisition systems.
(Ord. 25-04-21 Ord02, passed 4-21-2025)
§ 156.52 BESS PROHIBITED.
   No BESS or any part thereof shall be constructed, installed or operated
within the corporate limits of the Village of Argenta or within the
unincorporated territory lying within one and one-half miles of those corporate
limits (Argenta zoning jurisdiction) per statutory authority granted in ILCS
Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-13-26.
(Ord. 25-04-21 Ord02, passed 4-21-2025)
§ 156.53 VIOLATION.
   Should a BESS or any part thereof be constructed, installed or operated in
violation of this subchapter, the owner of the property shall cease operations
immediately and be subject to a fine not to exceed $750 per occurrence. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate occurrence.
