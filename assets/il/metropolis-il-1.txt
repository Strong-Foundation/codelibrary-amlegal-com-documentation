the error, or with consent of the City Council.

§ 10.17 COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former
ordinance, whether the former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any

offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of the proceeding, so far as practicable.

ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied
to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
   (B)   This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as abating any
action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the city
herein repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this
code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the
same provision; nor shall this chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
nullifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
city under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this code.
(1977 Code, § 1-2-3)
§ 10.18 NON-REVIVOR.
   Where any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision shall
be itself repealed, the repeal shall not be construed to revive such former

provided.
(1977 Code, § 1-2-4)
§ 10.19 EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES.
   All ordinances passed by the legislative body requiring publication shall
take effect from and after the due publication thereof, unless otherwise
expressly provided. Ordinances not requiring publication shall take effect from
their passage, unless otherwise expressly provided.
§ 10.20 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF ORDINANCE.
   Whenever any ordinance or part of an ordinance shall be repealed or modified
by a subsequent ordinance, the ordinance or part of an ordinance thus repealed
or modified shall continue in force until the due publication of the ordinance
repealing or modifying it when publication is required to give effect thereto,
unless otherwise expressly provided.
§ 10.21 ORDINANCES WHICH AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT CODE; PROCEDURE.
   If the legislative body shall desire to amend any existing chapter or
section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place. The following procedure shall be used to amend this code of ordinances:
   (A)   Determine if the ordinance under consideration should be included in
the code;
   (B)   If the ordinance under consideration is to be included in the code,
determine under which title, chapter and section (and division, if applicable)
it should be placed;
   (C)   The format of the ordinance amending the code should then be as
follows:
      (1)   Title. The same procedure is used in the amendment of divisions.
Example:
   “An ordinance amending the Metropolis Code, Title III, City government (use
appropriate title number and heading), Chapter 31, Committees (use appropriate
chapter number and heading), § 31.16, “mayor to appoint” (use appropriate
section number and heading).”
      (2)   Preamble. The preamble is desirable as an explanation of the City
Council’s policy or reasons for enacting the ordinance. Example:
         “Whereas, ...”
      (3)   Ordaining clause. An ordaining clause is absolutely necessary (ILCS
Ch. 65, Act 5, § 1-2-2). All ordinances must begin with the words, “BE IT
ORDAINED.” Example:
   “BE IT ORDAINED by the Mayor and City Council of the City of Metropolis,
Illinois:”
      (4)   Body and codification. This tells what part of the code is being
amended and then sets out the amendment itself. Example:
   Section 1: That Title III, Chapter 31, § 31.16 is hereby amended by adding
to the committees in § 31.16, the following:
         “(Insert amendment)”
      (5)   Effective date. All ordinances shall take effect and publication of
ordinances shall be made in accordance with the provisions of ILCS Ch. 65, Act
5, § 1-2-4;
      (6)   Separability. Those ordinances which are major policy enactments
and which contain many provisions, some of which may be challenged for their
constitutionality, ought to contain a paragraph such as the following:
   “The provisions and sections of this ordinance shall be deemed to be
separable, and the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect
the validity of the remainder.”
      (7)   Vote required. It is good practice, in the drafting of an
ordinance, to make a provision for listing the aldermen or trustees who voted
for and against adoption. Most ordinances require only a simple majority, but
there are some that have statutory requirements for a greater than majority
vote. For example, the vacation of a street or alley under ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5,
§ 11-91-1 requires the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the
aldermen, trustees or commissioners then holding office. In such cases, the
ordinance form should show the number then holding office, the number present
and the “aye” and “nay” vote. Example:
   “Passed by the Mayor and City Council of the City of Metropolis, Illinois,
on the        day of          , 2000.
         AYE                                        
         NAY                                         ”
      (8)   Form of signature. Following the date of passage and the recording
of the vote, the ordinance form may provide for the certification of the
Municipal Clerk that this was the action taken by the legislative body.
Following that is the place for the approval of the Mayor or President. This
becomes important in the case of a veto by the Mayor or President. Example:
   “______________________________         City Clerk of the City of
Metropolis, Illinois
Approved by the Mayor of the City of Metropolis, Illinois,       this    day of
     , 2000.
            _______________________________
             Mayor of the City of Metropolis, Illinois
ATTEST:
   ____________________________________
   City Clerk of the City of Metropolis, Illinois”
   (D)   Upon proper completion of steps set forth in divisions (A) through
(C), the code will be amended and will embody the provisions of the amending
ordinance.
(Ord. passed 9-26-1977)
§ 10.22 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and amending ordinances, if any, are listed
following the text of the code section. Example: (1977 Code, § 2-70) (Ord. 10,
passed 5-13-1960; Am. Ord. 15, passed 1-1-1970; Am. Ord. 20, passed 1-1-1980;
Am. Ord. 25, passed 1-1-1985)
   (B)   (1)   If an ILCS cite is included in the history, this indicates that
the text of the section reads substantially the same as the statute. Example:
§ 39.01 COMPOSITION.
   The City Council shall consist of the Mayor and Aldermen. It shall meet in
accordance with the Open Meetings Act, ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, §§ 1 et seq. It
shall keep a journal of its own proceedings.
(ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 3.1-40-5) (Ord. 81-0, passed 1-17-1981)
      (2)   If an ILCS cite is set forth as a “statutory reference” following
the text of the section, this indicates that the reader should refer to that
statute for further information. Example:
§ 39.02 MAYOR PRESIDES.
   The Mayor shall preside at meetings of the City Council.
Statutory reference:
   Additional provisions, see ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 3.1-40-30
§ 10.23 CHANGING THE NUMBER OF SECTIONS.
   No officer or employee of the city shall issue any book or pamphlet
containing any section or sections of this code numbered differently than as
numbered herein; and no section number shall be changed by the officer or
employee in drafting any ordinance amending any section, chapter or title of
same. In case any ordinance is introduced in the City Council, under which the
numbers of any of the sections of this ordinance would be changed if passed, it
shall be the duty of the City Clerk to submit to the Corporate Counsel for
correction as to such numbering before its passage.
(1977 Code, § 1-1-6)
§ 10.24 PRINTED LAW SUMMARIES.
   No officer or employee of the city shall issue, mail or distribute, as a
publication on the part of the city or any officer, department, bureau or
branch of the city government, any book, pamphlet, leaflet, card, circular or
other printed matter purporting to contain excerpts or quotations from the
Metropolis City Code or purporting to give the law on any subject to the
public, either as a reprint of a statute, ordinance or other legislative
enactment or as a digest, interpretation, resume, condensation or explanation
of the same, without submitting the book, pamphlet, leaflet, card, circular or
other printed matter, or the portion of same, which purports to quote or give
the law to the Corporate Counsel for examination and approval as to form and as
to whether or not the law is correctly stated therein.
(1977 Code, § 1-1-8)
§ 10.25 COPIES OF THE CODE.
   Two copies of the Metropolis City Code shall be printed, posted, or
otherwise mounted on paper sufficiently thick and tough to withstand heavy
usage, and preserved by the City Clerk in a book or binder in loose-leaf form,
or in such other form as the City Clerk may consider most expedient, so that
all amendments thereto and all general ordinances hereafter passed may be
inserted in their appropriate places in such volumes, and all sections or
ordinances repealed from time to time may be extracted for the purpose of
maintaining two copies in such condition that they will show all general
ordinances passed up to date at any time in such manner that ready reference
may be had thereto. In determining whether or not any ordinance hereafter
passed, or any part thereof, shall be inserted in the volume, and in
determining the form, place, title, chapter or section in which it shall be
inserted, and also in determining what shall be taken out, if any doubt arises,
the City Clerk shall be guided by the advice of the Corporate Counsel.
(1977 Code, § 1-1-10)
§ 10.26 DEPOSIT AND DISTRIBUTION.
   All printed copies of the Metropolis City Code belonging to the city shall
be deposited with the City Clerk. He or she shall deliver one copy thereof to
the Mayor, one copy to each Alderperson, and one copy to each department head
of the section of the code book that pertains to them.
(1977 Code, § 1-1-11)
§ 10.97 LICENSE REVOCATION.
   When a person is convicted of a violation of any section of this code, any
license previously issued to him or her by the city may be revoked by a court
of competent jurisdiction.
(1977 Code, § 1-3-2)
§ 10.98 AMENDMENT OF SECTION CONTAINING PENALTY.
   In cases of amendment of any section of this code containing provisions for
which a penalty is provided in another section, the penalty so provided in such
other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, whether
reenacted in the amendatory ordinance or not, unless the penalty is
specifically repealed therein.
(1977 Code, § 1-3-4)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   General penalty. Except as otherwise provided, any person convicted of
a violation of any section or provision of this code shall be fined a sum not
less than $75 plus court costs and not to exceed $750 plus court costs for any
one offense, and the person may be confined in a penal institution, other than
the penitentiary, for a period not to exceed six months. The provisions of this
section shall not apply to nor affect the ordinances enumerated under ILCS Ch.
65, Act 5, § 1-2.1-2, as said ordinances may be enacted by the city.
(1977 Code, § 1-3-1)
   (B)   Application of penalty.
      (1)   The penalty provided in this section shall be applicable to every
section of this code the same as though it were a part of each and every
separate section. Any person convicted of a violation of any section of this
code where any duty is prescribed or obligation imposed, or where any action
which is of a continuing nature or declared to be unlawful, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day the duty or obligation remains unperformed or the act continues, unless
otherwise specifically provided in this code.
      (2)   In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is
created by different clauses or sections of this code, the prosecuting officer
may elect under which to proceed; but not more than one recovery shall be had
against the same person for the same offense; provided, that the revocation of
a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar
any other penalty being enforced.
      (3)   Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act
constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this code and there shall
be no fine or penalty specifically declared for the breach, the provisions of
this section shall apply and a separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during or on which a breach or violation occurs or continues.
   (C)   Citation - court appearance not required - penalty. Notwithstanding
division (A) above, and within the scope of each of the following officers’
enforcement authority, any sworn law enforcement officer, the Animal Control
officer, the Code Enforcement officer, or the Zoning Administrator, as
applicable, may issue a No Court Appearance Required citation for a violation
of any city ordinances committed to their enforcement. Unless otherwise
provided in the specific ordinance or code section violated, such citation when
issued shall require the payment of a fine in the amount of $100 within 30 days
of the issuance of the citation. Such fine may be paid in the office of the
City Clerk. In the event any person issued a No Court Appearance Required
citation shall fail to pay the fine within 30 days from the date of the
issuance of the citation, the original issuing official shall issue a Notice To
Appear, requiring a court appearance for such violation. The penalty to be
imposed for a conviction of such violation following a court appearance shall
be the specific penalty provided for such offense in the code or, if no such
penalty is so provided, then the general penalty imposed under division (A)
above.

closed meeting of the corporate authorities or any committee thereof via
electronic means (such as by telephone, video or internet connection) provided
that such attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the corporate authorities of the city may
attend a meeting electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The member should notify the Clerk a reasonable period of time
before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance.
      (2)   The member must assert one of the following four reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes,
however, this reason may be utilized only three times during any 12-month
period; or
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency;
or
         (d)   The member cannot attend because of the business of the city.
      (3)   A 12-month period as described in division (B)(2)(b) above shall be
deemed to commence when a member first utilizes that reason for an absence.

      (1)   The Clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance request, shall
inform the corporate authority of the request for electronic attendance.
      (2)   After establishing that there is a quorum physically present at a
meeting where a member of the corporate authority desires to attend

accordance with this section; and
         (b)   The member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting
electronically.
   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically
and other members of the corporate authority must be able to communicate
effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communications at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at
any meeting, the corporate authority shall provide equipment adequate to
accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic
means.
   (F)   Rights of remote member. A member permitted to attend electronically
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as
to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically
shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded
by the Clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member
attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any
member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her
leaving and returning.

committees, boards and commissions established by authority of the city.

§ 31.010 POLICY AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
   (A)   Statement of policy.
      (1)   It is the City of Metropolis’ policy that it will not tolerate or
condone discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion,
creed, sex, gender-identity, gender-expression, sexual orientation, pregnancy,
childbirth, medical or common conditions relating to pregnancy and childbirth,

discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct by employees, managers,

employees with whom the City of Metropolis has a business, service, or
professional relationship. “Employee,” for purposes of this policy only,
includes any individual performing work for the City of Metropolis, an
apprentice, an applicant for apprenticeship, or an unpaid intern. The City of
Metropolis has appointed an Ethics Officer to receive and oversee
investigations of complaints made pursuant to this policy.

act of discrimination, harassment or misconduct in violation of this policy is
prohibited. Retaliation against any employee who participates in an
investigation pursuant to this policy is likewise prohibited. The City of

discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct and retaliation. The City of

against an employee who violates this policy.

prohibited. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for

nature when:
         (a)   Submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or
implicitly affects a term or condition of individual’s employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis
for an employment decision affecting the harassed employee; or
         (c)   The harassment has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with the employee’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive work environment because of the persistent, severe or
pervasive nature of the conduct.
      (4)   Sexual harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances,
including but not limited to the following:
         (a)   The employee as well as the harasser may be a woman or a man.
The employee does not have to be of the opposite sex.
         (b)   The harasser can be the employee’s supervisor, an agent of the
employer, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a non-employee.
         (c)   The employee does not have to be the person harassed but could
be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.
         (d)   Unlawful sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to
or discharge of the employee.
         (e)   The harasser’s conduct must be unwelcome.
      (5)   Each employee must exercise his or her own good judgment to avoid
engaging in conduct that may be perceived by others as sexual harassment or
harassment based on any status protected by law. The following are
illustrations of actions that the City of Metropolis deems inappropriate and in
violation of our policy:
         (a)   Unwanted sexual advances.
         (b)   Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors.
         (c)   Retaliating or threatening retaliation after a negative response
to a sexual advance or after an employee has made or threatened to make a
harassment complaint.
         (d)   Visual conduct such as leering, making sexual gestures,
displaying sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons, calendars or
posters.
         (e)   Verbal conduct such as making derogatory comments, using
epithets or slurs, making sexually explicit jokes or suggestive comments about
a person’s body or dress.
         (f)   Written or electronic communications of a sexual nature or
containing statements or images which may be offensive to individuals in a
particular protected group, such as racial or ethnic stereotypes or stereotypes
about disabled individuals.
         (g)   Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, assaulting, impeding
or blocking movements.
      (6)   Sexual misconduct is strictly prohibited by the City of Metropolis
and can include any inappropriate and/or illegal conduct of a sexual nature
including, but not limited to, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, sexual
intimidation, rape, sexual assault, or ANY sexual contact or sexual
communications with a minor (including, but not limited to, conduct or
communications which are written, electronic, verbal, visual, virtual or
physical).
   (B)   Responsibilities.
      (1)   Supervisors. Each supervisor shall be responsible for ensuring
compliance with this policy, including the following:
         (a)   Monitoring the workplace environment for signs of
discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct;
         (b)   Immediately notifying law enforcement where there is reasonable
belief that the observed or complained of conduct violates the criminal laws of
the State of Illinois.
         (c)   Immediately notifying the Department of Children and Family
Services (DCFS) Hotline (1-800-25-ABUSE, or 1-800-252-2873) if the observed or
complained of conduct involves the abuse of a minor.
         (d)   Immediately stopping any observed acts of discrimination,
harassment or sexual misconduct and taking appropriate steps to intervene,
whether or not the involved employees are within his/her line of supervision;
         (e)   Immediately reporting any complaint of harassment,
discrimination or sexual misconduct to the city attorney or to the Ethics
Officer; and
         (f)   Taking immediate action to limit the work contact between the
individuals when there has been a complaint of discrimination, harassment or
sexual misconduct, pending investigation.
      (2)   Employees. Each employee is responsible for assisting in the
prevention of discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct through the
following acts:
         (a)   Refraining from participation in, or encouragement of, actions
that could be perceived as discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct;
         (b)   Immediately reporting any violations of this policy to a
supervisor, the Ethics Officer, or city attorney and law enforcement (if
appropriate under the circumstances) and/or DCFS (if appropriate under the
circumstances); Employees are obligated to report violations of this policy as
soon as they occur. An employee should not wait until the conduct becomes
unbearable before reporting the prohibited conduct. All employees are obligated
to report instances of prohibited conduct even if the conduct is merely
observed and directed toward another individual and even if the other person
does not appear to be bothered or offended by the conduct. All employees are
obligated to report instances of prohibited conduct regardless of the identity
of the alleged offender (e.g. man, woman, supervisor, elected official,
appointed official, co-worker, volunteer, vendor, member of public).
         (c)   Encouraging any employee who confides that he/she is the victim
of conduct in violation of this policy to report these acts to a supervisor.
         (d)   An employee experiencing what he or she believes to be conduct
violating this policy, must not assume that the City is aware of the conduct.
If there are no witnesses and the employee/victim fails to notify a supervisor
or other designated official, the City will not be presumed to have knowledge
of the conduct that violates the policy.
      (3)   Failure to take action to stop known discrimination, harassment or
sexual misconduct may be grounds for discipline.
      (4)   There is a clear line in most cases between a mutual attraction and
a consensual exchange and unwelcome behavior or pressure for an intimate
relationship. A friendly interaction between two persons who are receptive to
one another is not considered unwelcome or harassment. Employees are free to
form social relationships of their own choosing. However, when one employee is
pursuing or forcing a relationship upon another who does not like or want it,
regardless of friendly intentions, the behavior is unwelcome sexual behavior.
An employee confronted with these actions is encouraged to inform the harasser
that such behavior is offensive and must stop. You should assume that sexual
comments are unwelcome unless you have clear unequivocal indications to the
contrary. In other words, another person does not have to tell you to stop for
your conduct to be harassment and unwelcome. Sexual communications and sexual
contact with a minor are ALWAYS prohibited.
      (5)   If you are advised by another person that your behavior is
offensive, you must immediately stop the behavior, regardless of whether you
agree with the person’s perceptions of your intentions.
      (6)   The City of Metropolis does not consider conduct in violation of
this policy to be within the course and scope of employment and does not
sanction such conduct on the part of any employee, including supervisory and
management employees.
   (C)   Applicable procedures. The City of Metropolis takes allegations of
discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct very seriously. It will
actively investigate all complaints. It is helpful for the employee to directly
inform the offending individual that the conduct is unwelcome and must stop.
The employee should use the City of Metropolis’ complaint procedure to advise
the City of Metropolis of any perceived violation of this policy as soon as it
occurs.
      (1)   Bringing a complaint. 
         (a)   Any employee of the City of Metropolis, who believes that there
has been a violation of this policy may bring the matter to the attention of
the City of Metropolis in one of the following ways:
            1.   Advising his or her supervisor or the Ethics Officer for City
of Metropolis; or
            2.   Advising the offending employee’s supervisor, the City
Attorney or the City Clerk in the event that the alleged harasser is the City
Attorney.
         (b)   If the complaint involves someone in the employee’s direct line
of command, then the employee should go directly to the City Attorney or the
Ethics Officer.
         (c)   The complaint should be presented as promptly as possible after
the alleged violation of this policy occurs.
         (d)   The City of Metropolis will take steps-to ensure that complaints
made are kept confidential to the extent permissible under the law. Individuals
who are involved in an investigation under this policy are required to keep the
matter confidential to the fullest extent permitted under the law.
      (2)   Resolution of a complaint. Promptly after a complaint is submitted,
the City of Metropolis will undertake such investigation, corrective and
preventive actions as are appropriate. In general, the procedure in resolving
any complaints can (but will not necessarily) include any of the following
items:
         (a)   A meeting between the employee making the complaint and an
individual designated by the City of Metropolis to investigate such complaints.
Important data to be provided by the complaining employee includes the
following:
            1.   A description of the specific offensive conduct;
            2.   Identification of all person(s) who engaged in the conduct;
            3.   The location where the conduct occurred;
            4.   The time when the conduct occurred;
            5.   Whether there were any witnesses to the conduct;
            6.   Whether conduct of a similar nature has occurred on prior
occasions;
            7.   Whether there are any documents or electronic communications
(text messages, emails, social media posts or recorded messages, etc.) which
would support the complaining employee’s allegations;
            8.   What impact the conduct had on the complaining employee.
         (b)   While not required, the City of Metropolis encourages anyone who
makes a complaint under this policy to provide a written statement setting
forth the above details and attaching any pertinent records.
         (c)   After a complaint is submitted by the employee, the employee
making the complaint shall be interviewed by a designated representative of the
city. The employee may have a co-worker present if desired and may request that
the interviewer be the same gender as the employee. Following this interview,
the designated representative shall interview any witnesses identified by the
complaining employee and investigate any physical evidence identified in the
complaint.
         (d)   After interviewing the complaining employee, any witnesses
identified by such employee, and reviewing any physical evidence, the alleged
offending individual should be contacted by a designated representative of the
City of Metropolis. The alleged offending individual should be advised of the
charges brought against him or her, and may be provided with a copy of the
written statement of complaint made by the complaining employee (if
applicable). The alleged offending individual should have an opportunity to
fully explain his or her side of the circumstances, and may also submit a
written statement, if desired.
         (e)   After the alleged offending individual is interviewed, any
witnesses identified by the alleged offending individual may be interviewed
separately.
         (f)   Once this investigation is completed, the City of Metropolis
will take such action as is appropriate based upon the information obtained in
the investigation. In the event that the City of Metropolis finds merit in the
charges made by the complaining employee, disciplinary action will be taken
against the offending employee. This disciplinary action may, but need not
necessarily, include:
            1.   Verbal or written reprimand;
            2.   Placing the offending employee on a corrective action plan for
a period of time to be identified;
            3.   Delay in pay increases or promotions;
            4.   Suspending the offending employee from work without pay;
            5.   Demotion;
            6.   Immediate termination.
         (g)   Upon completion of the investigation, the City of Metropolis
will advise the complaining employee of the results of the investigation,
including action taken, if any, against the offending individual.
         (h)   When investigating alleged violations of this policy, the City
of Metropolis looks at the whole record including, but not limited to, the
nature of the allegations, the context in which the alleged incidents occurred,
and the statements of the parties and witnesses. A determination on the
allegations is made from the facts on a case-by-case basis.
   (D)   Non-retaliation. Under no circumstances will there be any retaliation
against any employee making a complaint of discrimination, harassment or sexual
misconduct. Any act of retaliation by any party directed against a complaining
employee, an accused employee, witnesses, or participants in the process will
be treated as a separate and distinct complaint and will be similarly
investigated. Complaints of retaliation should be addressed to the Ethics
Officer, City Attorney or City Clerk. Illinois law provides protections to
whistleblowers as set forth in the Whistleblower Act, ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, §
15 and the Illinois Human Rights Act, ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, § 6-101.
   (E)   False reports prohibited. It is a violation of this policy for an
employee to knowingly make a false report of discrimination, harassment, sexual
misconduct, or retaliation. An employee who is found to have knowingly made a
false report is subject to disciplinary action, as set forth in division (C)(2)
(f) of this section.
   (F)   Additional resources. If you have any questions concerning the City of
Metropolis’ policies on this matter, please see your supervisor, the Ethics
Officer, or the City Attorney. Further information may also be obtained from
the Illinois Department of Human Rights, 312-814-6200 or the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 800-669-4000. Confidential reports of harassment
or discrimination may also be filed with these state agencies. For matters
involving the abuse of minors the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services (DCFS) may be contacted by dialing 800-25-ABUSE.

individual, the City of Metropolis will provide a statement of the purpose or
purposes for which the City of Metropolis is collecting and using the social

request submitted to the attention of the City Clerk those public records that
are in its possession and control, except that public records exempted from
inspection and copying as provided in § 7 of the Freedom of Information Act,
being 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 et seq., shall be exempt from disclosure. Public records
not exempt from inspection shall ordinarily be produced at the City Clerk’s
Office, during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
   (B)   Upon written request, the city will either produce public records not
otherwise exempt from disclosure for inspection or provide copies of the public
records for a fee of $.20 per page. Documents will be certified at a cost of $2
per document. The fee of $.20 is imposed as a reasonable estimate of the time
and cost to the city for reproducing public records and for the use, by any

certify a document is imposed as a reasonable charge for such service. The City
Clerk is authorized to reduce or waive payment of these fees in those instances
where it is the Clerk’s belief that a fee is not justified or the furnishing of
information is primarily in the public interest. Waiver or reduction of a fee
may be considered to be in the public interest if the principal purpose of the
request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety,
and welfare or the legal rights of the general public and is not for the
principal purpose of personal or commercial benefit. Persons requesting a
waiver or reduction of the fee must state the specific purpose for the request
and indicate a waiver or reduction is in the public interest. The decision of
the City Clerk shall be final and binding upon requests for fee reductions/
waivers.
   (C)   The city shall either comply with a written request for inspection
and/or copying of records or deny the request in writing within seven working
days of its receipt. The city may extend this time limit by an additional seven
working days by written notice for any of the reasons set forth in § 3(d) of
the Freedom of Information Act. In the event the City Clerk or the Clerk’s
staff determines that compliance with a request will be unduly burdensome, the
City Clerk shall notify the requestor and offer to confer with the requestor to
clarify or reduce the request. If the matter cannot be resolved in this
fashion, the City Clerk may, in writing, deny the request for reasons of undue
burden as specified in § 3(f) of the Freedom of Information Act.
   (D)   (1)   In the event a request for copying and/or inspection of public
records is denied in whole or in part, the City Clerk shall specify the
following in writing:

         (b)   The names and titles of each person responsible for the denial;
and
         (c)   The right of the requestor to appeal the denial to the Mayor.
      (2)   In the event denial is based on a claim that certain records are
exempt from disclosure under § 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, the denial
will specify the exemption(s) relied on. The requestor may appeal that denial
by submitting a written appeal delivered to the Mayor’s office, within ten
calendar days of the date of the denial. The appeal shall be addressed to the
Mayor of the City. The Mayor shall issue a written determination within seven
working days of receipt of the notice of appeal. If the Mayor denies the
appeal, the written determination shall inform the requestor of his or her
right to judicial review under § 11 of the Freedom of Information Act. Failure
of the Mayor to act shall constitute a denial of the request and of the appeal.
   (E)   The City Clerk shall promulgate and update as may be needed a summary
of information about the city that may be distributed to persons upon request.

            2.   These average mitigation rates were determined by itemizing
costs for a typical run (from the time a fire apparatus leaves the station
until it returns to the station) and are based on the actual costs, using
amortized schedules for apparatus (including useful life, equipment, repairs,
and maintenance) and labor rates (an average department’s “actual personnel
expense” and not just a firefighter’s basic wage). The actual personnel
expenses include costs such as wages, retirement, benefits, workers

independent event with custom mitigation rates. Itemized, per person, at
various pay levels and for itemized products use.

pollution or fire danger concerns, such person or persons will be liable for
the Fire Department response at a cost not to exceed the actual expenses
incurred by the Fire Department to respond and contain the fire. Similarly, if
a fire is started where permits are required for such a fire and the permit was
not obtained and the Fire Department is required to respond to contain the fire
the responsible party will be liable for the response at a cost not to exceed
the actual expenses incurred by the Fire Department. The actual expenses will
include direct labor, equipment costs and any other costs that can be
reasonably allocated to the cost of the response.
      (4)   Water incidents.
         (a)   Level 1 - basic response. Claim will include engine response,
first responder assignment, perimeter establishment, evacuations, first
responder set-up and command, scene safety and investigation (including

“billing level.” This occurs almost every time the Fire Department responds to
a water incident. Billed at $448 plus $56 per hour, per rescue person.
         (b)   Level 2 - intermediate response. Includes Level 1 services as
well as clean up and material used (sorbents), minor hazardous clean upand

the front desk of the hotel/motel shall also be sent by certified mail, receipt
requested with postage fully prepaid to the owner at the last known address of
the owner as provided to the city. The notice shall afford the owner 30 days in
which to correct the violations or to challenge the violations. Upon written
request and for just cause shown, the City Treasurer may grant an extension not
to exceed 60 days to comply with the Notice. Such an extension shall not extend
the time for filing a petition challenging the notice of deficiency and
delinquency as provided in §

§ 36.50 ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a notice of deficiency and delinquency, an owner shall

violations contained in the notice of deficiency and delinquency, the owner
must file a written petition stating specifically any issue which the owner
wishes to challenge together with any and all books, records, or other
documents or evidence that owner would offer as proof to contradict the
findings in the notice of deficiency and delinquency. Such petition and
supporting documents or evidence shall be filed in the office for the City
Clerk for the City of Metropolis. Failure to timely file the written petition
and supporting documents and evidence as aforesaid shall result in a conclusive
presumption that the violations were committed by owner as described therein
and that all sums claimed to be due by city are correct.
   (B)   Upon timely receipt of a written petition and supporting documents and
evidence, the City Treasurer shall schedule a hearing upon the petition. In any
such hearing, the city shall be represented by the City Attorney or Corporation
Counsel. The owner, may at its sole expense, be represented by an attorney of
its choice. Owner shall bear the burden of proof in any such hearing. The City
Treasurer or an attorney at law, other than the City Attorney or Corporation
Counsel, shall act as the hearing officer. In the event the City Treasurer
performed the examination or audit of records, she may need to be called as a
witness so an independent attorney at law shall act as hearing officer. The
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with written rules established by the
City Treasurer similar to rules for other civil proceedings. Evidence shall be
taken by sworn testimony and the production of authenticated documents. The
strict rules of evidence shall not apply and hearsay or other evidence which
might not be admitted in a court of law may be admitted in these hearings
provided the same is relevant, material, and some proof of its reasonable
reliability is offered. A complete record of the hearing shall be taken and
prepared by a licensed or certified shorthand reporter or by a reliable
electronic recording device and a transcript of the hearing shall be produced
upon payment of the cost for such production by the party requesting it.
   (C)   Following the hearing, the City Treasurer shall issue a written
decision which shall set forth the Treasurer’s factual findings, decision, and
order regarding the issues raised by the owner in the petition. The findings,
decision, and order of the Treasurer shall be subject to review by the Circuit
Court of the First Judicial Circuit for Massac County, Illinois in accordance
with the provisions of the Administrative Review Law (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§
3-101, et seq.). After expiration of the period of time within which judicial
review under the administrative review law may be sought for a final
determination of a violation of this subchapter, the City may commence a
proceeding in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit for Massac
County, Illinois for purposes of reducing the findings, decision, and order to
a judgment.
   (D)   Nothing set forth herein shall preclude city from pursuing any and all
other remedies for the enforcement of this subchapter and the collection of any
taxes due it without first using the administrative procedures provided herein;
including without limitation a civil action against the owner to recover
judgment for all taxes, penalties, interest, costs of collection, costs of suit
and reasonable attorney’s fees.

becoming final and non-appealable, shall result in a discontinuance of all
utility services to the hotel/motel owned by the person convicted. A transfer
of ownership of the hotel/motel prior to the payment of fines and court costs

services to the hotel/motel that was involved in the violation.

Cross-reference:
   Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct, see §
31.010
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 37.01 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the city to prohibit harassment of
any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee,
municipal agency or municipal office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or municipal offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 8-10-2020)
§ 37.02 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines SEXUAL HARASSMENT as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual’s employment, either explicitly or implicitly;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute SEXUAL HARASSMENT includes, but is not
limited to:
      (1)   Verbal harassment: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence;
      (2)   Non-verbal harassment: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, catcalls,
smacking or kissing noises;
      (3)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
      (4)   Physical harassment: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault;
      (5)   Textual/electronic harassment: sexting (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites like
Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of SEXUAL HARASSMENT are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some SEXUAL HARASSMENT is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess SEXUAL HARASSMENT by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 8-10-2020)
§ 37.03 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes himself
or herself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident
(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his or her
position to the offending employee, and his or her immediate supervisor. It is
not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the
report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his or her objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, corporation counsel, an ethics officer,
or the chief elected official of the municipality.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
      (4)   Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official
of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the corporation counsel, the
City Clerk or the chief elected official of the municipality. The official
receiving the request shall take immediate action in keeping with the
procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified individual or
entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual harassment in
violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review shall be
reported to the corporate authorities.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 8-10-2020)
§ 37.04 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee’s or official’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For purposes of this policy, RETALIATORY ACTION means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee’s or official’s involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy
prohibits retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an
employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a
court, an administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee
or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation.
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, § 6-
101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire to retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which
he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted or participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 8-10-2020)
§ 37.05 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or
the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable disciplinary
actions or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. 2020-19, passed 8-10-2020)
§ 37.06 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State
Police, a State’s Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement
official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

(Ord. 2002-1, passed 2-11-2002)
§ 50.28 CUSTOMER CONTRIBUTION TO COST OF EXTENSION.
   (A)   The Electric Department will design its facilities in the most safe,
reliable, environmentally acceptable manner and at the lowest reasonable
current cost following acceptable engineering and planning practices as
determined by the Electric Department. When new or additional electric services
requested by a customer, the Electric Department will prepare a written
estimate of the cost of extending such new or expanded service. The Electric
Department shall include in any estimate for new, additional or expanded
service the installation of service line, right of way clearing, surveying of
easements and all other costs incident to making the extension of services.
Additional costs incurred for the construction in frozen ground, rocky terrain,
water crossing, and all applicable engineering and general overheads shall be
included. The cost of removing existing facilities shall include equipment,
labor and transportation less accumulated depreciation and salvage value of
facilities removed. If it is beneficial to the Electric Department to install
facilities in excess of that required to serve the Applicant applying for
service, the added costs of these facilities will be borne by the Electric
Department.
   (B)   For residential developments, the owner shall submit to the Electric
Department, three copies of the final approved subdivision plat, clearly
showing all lots, lot sizes in square footage and easements. The Electric
Department will utilize the plat to design facilities for establishment of
electric service on the property of the owner. Overhead facilities that may be
necessary on the owner’s property and all facilities required to connect the
city’s electric system to the facilities on the owner’s property will be
estimated and separately charged to the owner.
   (C)   For all other developments, the Water, Light and Street Committee
shall determine the actual cost to be paid by the customer for providing the
extension and/or modification to the primary distribution system based on
actual development costs involved and anticipated electric service revenues
from the proposed project.
   (D)   For residential developments, the cost to be charged will be based on
$650 per lot for all lots 9,000 or less square feet in size. For lots larger
than 9,000 square feet, the base charge shall be increased by $2 per 100 square
feet.
   (E)   Of the total amount charged to the property owner, one-half must be
paid prior to the electric department ordering material for the project. The
remaining one-half must be paid prior to the commencement of construction.
   (F)   The listed charges in this section are based upon fiscal year 2002
construction costs, which are based on the United Stated Consumer Price Index
of 177.50. Each year, at the beginning of the city’s fiscal year, the unit
costs will be escalated by the ratio of the United States Consumer Price Index
on the first published date after the beginning of the most recent fiscal year
to the index included here. This escalation shall be rounded to the nearest
dollar.
      (1)   Extensions for new service development.
         (a)   This section shall apply to those situations where a request for
electric service will require an extension and/or modification to the primary
distribution system, and where the Electric Department determines that it is in
the best interests of the city to share in the cost of the system extension
and/or modification, considering the social and economic benefit to be derived
by the public from said extension and/or modification. It is anticipated that
this section would have application in regard to industrial and commercial
projects, as well as residential subdivisions and multifamily housing
development.
         (b)   When making application for an extension and/or modification of
the primary distribution system to serve a proposed development, the applicant
shall furnish the Water, Light and Street Committee with sufficiently complete
development plans and electric service requirements and usage data to enable
the Water, Light and Street Committee to determine the specific extension and/
or modification to the primary distribution system required to serve the
proposed project.
      (2)   Code compliance.
         (a)   Every contractor or person responsible for the installation of
the customer’s electric lines, appliances and other equipment related to
electric service shall comply with the provisions of these electric service
rules and regulations.
         (b)   If, upon inspection by the city or its representative, certain
installations are found to contain discrepancies, the discrepancies shall be
corrected before permanent connection of service will be completed. Or at its
option, the city may mail the customer a written request demanding conformity
within a ten-day period or any prior service connection made by the Electric
Department will be disconnected and terminated.
      (3)   Utility facilities on customer’s premises.
         (a)   This rule shall apply to the distribution facilities required to
serve either a group of customers in multi-tenancy premises or a single
customer where, in either case, the Electric Department finds that it is
necessary to install portions of the facilities on the premises being served.
The customer or property owner, when requested by the Electric Department,
shall make provision on customer’s property for the installation of Electric
Department owned facilities required for this service or services.
         (b)   Electric Department facilities shall consist of those, which in
the opinion of the Electric Department are necessary to furnish adequate
service. The Electric Department will design such installations and will
install facilities, which in its opinion, are most economical or feasible to
the Electric Department, under the conditions met. Where the Electric
Department’s installation is located in a property owner’s building, the
applicable provisions of these electric service rules and regulations shall be
observed, except that metering devices shall be externally accessible.
         (c)   A customer or property owner shall furnish, own and maintain the
necessary indoor or outdoor enclosures, building structural supports and
accessories as specified by the Electric Department.
         (d)   If a customer or property owner requests any changes in the plan
proposed by the Electric Department, he or she shall pay the City Clerk, in
advance of construction, the estimated excess cost, as determined by the
Electric Department, of the substituted installation.

CUSTOMER SELF-GENERATION POLICIES
§ 50.35 NET METERING POLICY.
   (A)   The city shall make available, upon request, net metering service to
any customer taking service from the city and who meets the requirements set
forth in this policy. For purposes of this policy, NET METERING means service
to an electric customer under which electric energy generated by that electric
customer from an eligible on-site generating facility owned by that customer
and, under some circumstances, delivered to the local distribution facilities,
may be used to offset electric energy provided by the electric utility to the
electric customer as provided for in this policy. The term NET METERING is not
used as a limiting term, but rather is used in its general sense to include the
full range of methods for valuing customer self-generation and implementing
fair credits for excess energy delivered to the municipal distribution system
by the customer. For multi-unit residential and commercial buildings, if all
units are on the same account it qualifies as a single customer for purposes of
this policy. If individual units are separately metered and individual tenants
have individual accounts, then the term CUSTOMER only refers to the building
owner and any usage by the owner. The city cannot be responsible to allocate
renewable generation facilities to individual accounts in a multi-unit
residential or commercial building. Before the project starts construction,
customer must complete the application form attached to Ordinance No. 2023-03
and receive approval from the Director of Public Works. Before the project in
service date, the contractor must complete and deliver the Certification of
Completion attached to Ordinance No. 2023-03 to the Director of Public Works
for approval.
   (B)   For purposes of this policy an eligible on-site generating facility
shall be defined as a renewable generating facility, such as a photovoltaic
facility and small wind turbines, and may include technology to store renewable
energy at the customer’s premises. Other forms of renewable generation shall be
considered on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, facilities interconnected
must be deemed by the city to be renewable to qualify for this policy.
   (C)   The electric generating facility must also abide by the city’s
interconnection standards currently in place at the time of installation to be
an eligible on-site generating facility.
   (D)   Subject to the limitations set forth herein, the city shall make net
metering service available upon request to any city residential or small
commercial electric customer with an eligible on-site generating facility owned
by the customer. The determination whether a customer is a residential or small
commercial customer is based on the rate classification under which the
customer takes electric service. The eligible onsite generating facility shall
be located on the customer’s premises and on the customer’s side of the billing
meter and be sized to primarily produce only enough electricity to offset the
customer’s own electrical requirements. Proper sizing of eligible on-site
generating facilities shall be determined as set forth in division (K) below.
   (E)   Any request for net metering service by a customer that is not a
residential or small commercial customer shall be considered on a case by case
basis. The decision with respect to such facilities shall be made by the city’s
Director of Public Works based on potential impacts to the distribution system
or portions thereof and to the property of other customers of the city.
Customers that do not qualify for net metering service under this policy shall
be permitted to interconnect and self-generate as required by and in accordance
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s rules under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) on a case by case basis.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the provisions in division (D), the city reserves the
authority to withhold, deny or delay approval of the interconnection of
proposed on-site generating facilities and of net metering service hereunder if
the operation of the facility would be unsafe or pose a risk of adverse impacts
to the distribution system or portions thereof or to the property of other
customers of the city. The city shall withhold approval for only so long as is
reasonably necessary to remedy the risk of adverse impact. The city shall only
deny approval if the adverse impact cannot reasonably be remedied or if the
customer refuses to meet all applicable state and local safety and electrical
code requirements or refuses to provide for payment of the costs of the
improvements to the facility or the system that are required to accommodate the
otherwise eligible on-site generating facility. The city shall not be required
to make unscheduled improvements to its distribution system or portions thereof
to remedy the situation causing the delayed or withheld approval unless the
customer agrees to pay for the reasonable costs thereof. Likewise, the city may
require a customer with an approved on-site generating facility that has been
installed and begun to operate to suspend operations of the facility if it
becomes unsafe or causes adverse impacts to the distribution system or portions
thereof or to the property of other customers of the city, and such suspension
shall be in place only so long as is reasonably necessary to remedy the adverse
impact. The city may require the customer to disconnect the on-site generating
facility from the distribution system in serious situations.
   (G)   (1)   Energy generated by the customer-owned generator during the
billing period may supply all or a portion of the energy required by the
customer’s load. The customer shall be credited for excess energy delivered by
the customer to the city at the meter from the approved on-site generating
facility.
      (2)   For any energy generated by the customer in excess of the energy
required by the customer’s loads for a given billing period, a credit shall be
carried forward to the customer’s next billing period. For all eligible on-site
generating facilities, the following credit method shall be used to determine
excess energy credit. For energy delivered by the utility to the customer at
the meter, as reflected in the meter reading, shall be billed at the
appropriate utility full retail energy rate. For any excess energy generated by
the customer from an approved on-site generating facility and delivered by the
customer to the utility at the meter, as reflected in the meter reading, a
credit shall be created and applied to the customer’s bill based upon the
lesser of the full retail energy rate for the customer class and the avoided
cost of energy. Avoided cost shall be determined as set forth in division (J)
below. The city shall install an appropriate meter to measure both the energy
delivered by the utility to the customer at the meter and the energy delivered
by the customer to the utility at the meter from the approved on-site
generating facility.
      (3)   Credits from electric energy delivered to the municipal
distribution system by the customer shall be used to offset usage based
electric energy (kWh) charges only. No such credits shall be applied to, and
the customer shall remain responsible for:
         (a)   Taxes, fees, and other charges that would otherwise be
applicable to the net amount of electric energy (kWh) purchased by the customer
from the city or consumed by the customer; and
         (b)   Other charges to the customer under any other rules, regulations
or rates that are not based on per kilowatt-hour (kWh) charges, including but
not limited to, basic service charges, customer service charges, facilities
charges, demand charges, kVAR charges, transformation charges, taxes and
assessments billed on other than kWh basis, rental fees, and late fees.
      (4)   The city shall carry over any unused credits earned and apply those
credits to subsequent billing periods to offset usage based electric energy
(kWh) charges only for electric energy supplied to the customer by the city
until all credits are used or until the end of the annual period. The annual
period shall end each year on December 31. At the end of the annual period or
in the event that the customer terminates service at the service location with
the city prior to the end of annual period, any remaining credits in the
customer’s account shall expire and no credit or payment shall be due to the
customer for such expired credits. In the event of termination of an account
qualifying for net metering under this policy, any outstanding credits are
surrendered. No credit or payment shall be due to the customer for such
surrendered credits. Under no circumstance will credits for excess energy
transfer to a new customer at the service location after the customer’s service
with the city terminates.
   (H)   Any costs the city incurs associated with the interconnection of
generating facilities by a customer, including but not limited to changes in
metering (to include installation of a bi-directional meter), or other physical
facilities, whether on the customer’s premises or a reasonably necessary
upgrade to the municipal distribution system or a portion thereof that is not
on the customer’s premises, shall be borne by the customer seeking to install
or for whom the generating facility was installed; provided however that such
costs shall be capped at $1,500 to each qualifying customer interconnecting
facilities of ten kW or less. For those facilities greater than ten kW that are
deemed to qualify under this policy, all costs associated with the
interconnection of the generating facility shall be borne by the customer
seeking to install or for whom the generating facility was installed. Costs
assessed under this section shall be demonstrable and cost based. Such costs
shall not include or be based on reduced sales by or lost revenues to the city
associated with-net metering service.
   (I)   The city shall develop such documents as needed to implement this
policy and any customer applying for or taking service hereunder shall execute
all appropriate documents.
   (J)   From and after the adoption of this policy, for all approved onsite
generating facilities, including currently existing facilities, “avoided cost”
shall be determined based on the sum of divisions (J)(1) and (2) below.
      (1)   The rate in cents per kWh as published and approved annually by the
governing body of the city based on the calculations and recommendation from
the city’s electric wholesale supplier. Such rate shall be approved annually in
a public meeting. The rate shall take into consideration the following:
         (a)   Historic real time pricing of prior calendar year of energy in
the wholesale market as valued at the locational marginal pricing (LMP) for
that location as defined by the appropriately located Regional Transmission
Organization (RTO).
         (b)   Solar-weighted LMP. The simple average of the LMP weighted using
solar weighting. SOLAR WEIGHTING is the expected production of each hour of a
typical solar installation as determined using the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) System Advisory Model (SAM) as may be amended from time to
time.
         (c)   Capacity value. Appropriate RTO capacity price with solar
factors applied for average system peak times.
         (d)   Transmission value. Appropriate RTO transmission cost recovery
with solar factor applied for average peak times.
      (2)   The rate in cents per kWh as calculated by the city for the
avoidance of distribution system losses.
   (K)   The maximum size in kilowattsAC of the eligible on-site generating
facility for an individual customer service location in the rate categories
identified in division (D) shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   The installation of a renewable generating facility under this
policy is intended to supply all or a portion of the customer’s own usage of
electricity. Therefore, in order to be approved, a renewable generating
facility must be properly sized so as not to exceed the customer’s expected
annual usage based on the customer’s current energy needs. It is also important
to the customer that the generating facilities are properly sized because the
credits under this policy for excess energy delivered to the distribution
system expire if not used within the time period established in this policy. As
part of the interconnection application, customer’s energy usage will be
analyzed using 36 months of historical energy usage (if available) in order to
calculate the customer’s expected annual usage. If a customer provides
documentation specifying why the usage has increased over that time, such as
home renovation/addition or installation of electric heating or an electric
vehicle charging station on the premises, then the previous 12-month period
shall be used to determine the average for the expected annual usage. If the
applicable months of data are not available for an individual customer, the
average usage amounts by other similar customers of the city, as determined by
the city, shall be used to set the expected annual usage. If facilities are
allowed for customers in other rate classes, the right-sizing shall be
determined on a case by case basis.
      (2)   In addition to the foregoing historic usage, the city shall
consider potential adverse impacts to the distribution system and to other
customers of the city that will be caused by or expected to be caused by the
installation of the new renewable generating facility at the particular
customer service location as part of the interconnection application review.
The maximum size of the eligible on-site generating facility for an individual
customer service location shall be reduced below the expected annual usage of
the customer to mitigate the potential adverse impacts to the distribution
system or portions thereof and to the other customers of the city unless the
customer pays for any necessary upgrade to the system or portion thereof to
avoid the potential adverse impact.
   (L)   The city reserves the right to interpret, amend or rescind this
policy. Nothing herein is intended to nor shall it create a right for a
customer to rely on any particular netting or crediting methodology contained
in the policy from time to time, and all rates for excess credits are subject
to change in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois governing
municipalities.
   (M)   Citizen and customer concerns generally with this net metering policy
may be raised in the public comment portion of any open meeting of the
governing body of the city at any time and will be considered by the governing
body in accordance with its normal processes. Individual customer complaints,

§ 50.36 INTERCONNECTION POLICY.
   (A)   The city shall make available, upon request, interconnection services
to any customer that meets the required guidelines. INTERCONNECTION SERVICES,
in this policy, refers to on-site generating facilities (as defined in the

distribution system in a manner that will allow excess electricity generated by
the eligible on-site generating facility to be safely delivered onto the city’s
electric distribution system.
   (B)   Guidelines for interconnecting to the utility system are as follows:
      (1)   Only generating facilities that have been approved by the Director
of Public Works shall be interconnected with the city’s electric distribution
system.
      (2)   All interconnections shall comply with codes established by
National Electrical Code (NEC), National Electrical Safety Code (NESC),
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Underwriters
Laboratories (UL) as they may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Construction and development of generating facilities is required
to follow all applicable building codes, permitting processes, and zoning
rules.
      (4)   The city is under no obligation to purchase energy supplied to the
utility under this standard. This does not preclude the customer meeting
applicable standards that would allow the customer to supply power onto the
utility’s system and receive credit for such energy under the utility’s
Customer Self-Generation Net Metering Policy or the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act (PURPA).
      (5)   The city may require periodic testing of systems. All test reports
shall be submitted to the city’s Electric Department after completion of the
testing.
      (6)   The city may charge reasonable fees associated with the
implementation and application of this policy.
   (C)   The terms and conditions for any and all such interconnections are set
forth in the interconnection agreement attached to Ordinance No. 2023-03, which
may be reasonably adapted by the city's staff from time to time in implementing
this policy and the Customer Self-Generation Net Metering Policy.
   (D)   The city staff shall develop such documents as needed to implement
this policy from time to time.

nuisance. In forming his or her opinion as to the acceptability of these
wastes, the city will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and maximum limits established by regulatory agencies. The
substances prohibited are as follows:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150°F (65°C);
      (2)   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous materials, or
oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l, or containing

      (12)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in division (C) and (D) above, and/or which are
in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in 40 C.F.R. part 403,
June 26, 1978 and any amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the city
may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, the city may do as follows:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment in accordance to §
52.21 and 40 CFR part 403;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of §
52.16; and
      (5)   If the city permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the city, and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
   (F)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the city they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other
harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type
and capacity approved by the city, and shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (H)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together
with the necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to
facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. The manhole,
when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed
in accordance with plans approved by the City Engineer. The manhole shall be
installed by the owner at his or her expense, and shall be maintained by him or
her so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   (1)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
      (2)   The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be
performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but no less than
once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents
of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state,
and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the city at such times and in such a
manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the city. At such times as
deemed necessary the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples
for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   (J)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should
be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH’s are determined
from periodic grab samples.
   (K)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with §
52.15, by the industrial concern provided the payments are in accordance with
federal and state guidelines for user charge system.

of the city or its designee and deemed necessary by the city to verify that the
user is in compliance with the said permit;
      (12)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
   (E)   Alternative discharge limits.  
      (1)   Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the regulated
process, the city or its designee may derive fixed alternative discharge limits
for the Discharge Permit. These alternative limits shall be applied to the
mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the combined waste stream formula
and/or flow-weighted average formula as defined in division (I).
      (2)   Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard
are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production
(production-based standard), the city or its designee may convert the limits to
equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day
or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent permit
limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all
permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully
comply with these alternative limits.
      (3)   All significant industrial users subject to production-based
standards must report production rates annually so that alternative permit
limits can be calculated if necessary. The significant industrial user must
notify the city or its designee 30 days in advance of any major change in
production levels that will affect the limits in the Discharge Permit.
   (F)   Permit duration. Discharge Permits shall be issued for a specified
time period, not to exceed five years. A Discharge Permit may be issued for a
period less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user
shall apply for permit re-issuance a minimum of 120 days prior to the
expiration of the user’s existing permit. The terms and conditions of the
permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit
as limitations or requirements as identified in §
52.21 are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of
any proposed changes in the permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date
of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a
reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (G)   Permit transfer. Discharge Permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. A Discharge Permit shall not be reassigned or transferred
or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without prior approval by the city. The city may deny the transfer of
the permit for any reason deemed reasonably necessary for the protection of its
wastewater treatment system or of the environment.
   (H)   Compliance data reporting. Within 90 days following the date for
achieving compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in
the case of a new user, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the WWTP, any user subject to categorical pretreatment
standards shall submit, to the city or its designee, a report indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by categorical pretreatment standards and the average
and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user’s facility which are
limited by such categorical pretreatment standards. The report shall state
whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional pretreatment and time schedule is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the user.
   (I)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall submit, to the city or its
designee, every six months (on dates specified in the discharge permit) unless
required more frequently by the Discharge Permit, a report indicating, at a
minimum, the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by categorical pretreatment standards or the Discharge Permit. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during
the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the
city or its designee and in consideration of such factors as local high or low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, and the like, the city or its designee may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
      (2)   All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to the
city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures established
by the U.S. EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto and 40 CFR 261 or with any
other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA
Administrator.
      (3)   Where IPEA does not include a sampling or analytical technique for
the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the USEPA publication “Sampling and
Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority
Pollutants,” April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and
analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
      (4)   A Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR) must be submitted to the city or
its designee by all significant industrial users at least 90 days prior to
initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The BMR must contain, at a
minimum, the following:
         (a)   Production data: a process description, SIC code number, raw
materials used, chemicals used or stored on site, final product, pretreatment
industrial category (if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of
discharge to the sewer system.
         (b)   Identifying information to include name, address of facility,
owner(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility.
         (c)   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow, types of
discharges, average and maximum flows from each process.
         (d)   Nature/concentration of pollutants: analytical results for all
pollutants regulated by this chapter and/or any applicable categorical
pretreatment standards and sample type and location. All analyses must conform
with IEPA requirements.
         (e)   Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat
the facility’s discharge.
      (5)   New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in
divisions (I)(4)(c) and (I)(4)(d) above, but at no time shall a new source
commence discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet
provisions of this chapter. All new sources must be in compliance with all
provisions of this chapter, state and categorical pretreatment standards prior
to commencement of discharge to the public sewer.
   (J)   Permit violations.
      (1)   All significant industrial users must notify the city or its
designee within 24 hours of first becoming aware of a permit violation. This
notification shall include the date of violation, the parameter violated and
the amount by which the parameter was exceeded.
      (2)   The user shall immediately repeat the sampling and analysis of the
parameter(s) in question and submit the results to the city or its designee
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Exception to this
regulation is only if the city performs the sampling within the same time
period for the same parameter(s) in question.
   (K)   Monitoring.
      (1)   The city shall require significant industrial users to provide and
operate, at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities and equipment
necessary to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building
sewer and/or internal drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally
be situated on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to
be constructed in a public right-of-way. The city or its designee shall review
and approve the location, plans, and specifications for such monitoring
facilities and may require them to be constructed to provide for the separate
monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows.
         There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility shall be designed and maintained in a manner such that the safety of
city and user personnel shall be the foremost concern. The facility, sampling,
and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
         Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
approval of the location, plans and specifications.
      (2)   All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved federal EPA
procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period shall be submitted
to the city or its designee regardless of whether or not that analysis was
required by the industrial user’s Discharge Permit.
      (3)   The industrial user must receive the approval of the city before
changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities to be used in all
required sampling.
   (L)   Pretreatment. All significant industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and achieve
compliance with any applicable categorical pretreatment standards within the
time limitations as specified by the categorical pretreatment standards. The
city may require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of
pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any significant industrial user
that cannot meet discharge limits required by this chapter. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level required by this chapter shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the city for review, and must be accepted by to the city prior to
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions
of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to
the user’s initiation of the changes.
   (M)   Annual publication.
      (1)   The city shall annually publish a list of significant industrial
users, which were in significant noncompliance with any categorical
pretreatment standards. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement
actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months. This notice shall
be published in a newspaper regularly published in Massac County, Illinois, but
if there is none, then in a newspaper of general circulation in Massac County,
Illinois.
      (2)   All records relating to the city’s pretreatment program shall be
made available to officials of the EPA or Approval Authority upon request. All
records shall be maintained for a minimum of three years in accordance with 40
CFR 403.12(O)(2).
   (N)   Significant non-compliance. A user is defined as being in significant
noncompliance when it commits one or more of the following conditions:
      (1)   Causes imminent endangerment to human health or the environment or
results in the exercise of emergency authority;
      (2)   Involves failure to report noncompliance accurately;
      (3)   Results in a chronic violation defined here as 66% or more of all
measurements taken during a six-month period that exceed (by any magnitude) the
daily maximum limit or the monthly average limit for the same pollutant
parameter;
      (4)   Results in a Technical Review Criteria (TRC) Violation defined here
as 33% or more of all measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a
six-month period that equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or
the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS,
fats, and oil and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (5)   Any violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the city
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through or has endangered the health of the WWTP personnel
or the public;
      (6)   Any discharge causing imminent endangerment to human health/welfare
or to the environment or resulting in the WWTP’s use of its emergency authority
to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (7)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, failure to comply
with schedule milestones for starting or completing construction or attaining
final compliance by 90 days or more after the schedule date;
      (8)   Failure to provide required reports within 30 days of the due date;
      (9)   Any violation or group of violations, which the city determines,
will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
   (O)   Confidential information.
      (1)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests in writing and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection from disclosure pursuant to an applicable exemption
under the Freedom of Information Act.
      (2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose information not subject to disclosure under the
Freedom of Information Act, as amended, shall not be made available for
inspection by the public but shall be made available to all governmental
agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES Permit, Sludge Disposal
System Permit and/or the Pretreatment Programs upon request. Such portions of a

vacant property status while the property is unoccupied. While the premise is
on vacant property status, the applicant shall pay a $40 per month utility
maintenance fee, plus the actual electric charge for electric energy utilized,
but not less than the monthly minimum charge provided in § 50.25. An account
placed on vacant property status shall remain on vacant property status only so

originally qualify or to remain on vacant property status.
   (C)   The city shall terminate the vacant property status or designation
during any month the Clerk determines the property to be occupied or during any
month in which the electric consumption exceeds 200 Kwh. The Clerk may
retroactively impose full utility charges for any month or period of months
that the Clerk determines the premises have been occupied without prior notice
to the City Clerk's Office.
   (D)   In the event an applicant shall fail to inform the city within 72
hours of when a premise becomes occupied, the city may disconnect all utility
service to the premises and such utility services shall not be restored until
the applicant shall pay a civil penalty of $100 to the city in addition to
those retroactive charges imposed under division (C) of this section.
   (E)   It shall be a violation of this section for any person, firm,
corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company, or the entity to
make any misrepresentation, false or misleading statement, or to omit any
required or requested information in order to obtain or continue vacant
property status for any property within the city.

company, or other entity who is found to have violated this section shall be

building has no water or sewer service within or attached to such structure and
there are no outside water hydrants on the property.
      (4)   Municipal solid waste removal service will not be provided to
properties that qualify for electric service only status.

construct or maintain a non-commercial garage or storage building contrary to
applicable provisions of the city's building code, zoning ordinance and
regulations, or any other city ordinance.

§ 95.02 ABATEMENT NOTICE.
   (A)   Generally. The owner, agent, occupant or person in possession, charge
or control of any land, structure, premises, item or object, real or personal,
in or upon which any nuisance exists shall be served a notice to abate the same
within a specified reasonable time in a manner as the notice shall direct or in
any other reasonable manner. The time allowed by the notice shall, in any
event, be considered reasonable if five days’ notice is given.
   (B)   Person giving notice. A notice to abate a nuisance may be given by the
Building Inspector, the city’s Code Enforcement or Abatement Officers, the
Chief of the Police Department, the Chief of the Fire Department, any member of
the Police Department, any member of the Fire Department, or any person
designated by the Mayor as having authority to give the notice and any other

   (C)   Service of notice. It shall be considered sufficient to notify the
owner, agent, occupant or person in possession, charge or control of the land,
structure, premises, item or object in or upon which the nuisance exists in
person or by ordinary mail sent to the owner of the premises as disclosed in
the current tax records of the county. A notice shall be deemed sufficient
although the person to which it is directed refused delivery of the same or it
is not deliverable. The notice shall be presumed delivered if not returned to
the city as not deliverable. In the event the owner, agent, occupant or person
in possession, charge or control of the land, structure, premises, item or
object is unknown or on reasonable search is not ascertainable, it shall be
sufficient to give notice by posting on the premises. If notice is served on
anyone other than the owner as shown in the tax records of the county, a copy
thereof shall be delivered personally to the owner or sent by ordinary mail to
the owner at the same time as notice is given to the other person. If any
nuisance relates to an unfit, unsafe or dangerous structure, a copy of the
notice shall also be sent to any lien holders of record, provided the lack of
the notice shall not affect any proceedings hereunder.
   (D)   Contents of notice. Every notice served under this chapter shall, in
addition to requiring the abatement of the nuisance, state the proposed method
of abatement and warn the person to which the notice is directed that a failure
to accomplish the abatement within the time stated herein may result in the
abatement of the nuisance by the city and that the cost or expenses related to
the removal by the city shall be charged to the person. The proposed method of
abatement shall not limit the method of abatement to be used.
   (E)   Posting property.
      (1)   Any real or personal property relative to which a notice has or is
about to be given may be posted advising that the property has been declared a
nuisance, has been condemned, has been declared dangerous and unsafe or has
been declared unsafe for human occupancy or use. The form of notice shall be
determined by the person giving the notice. No person shall remove any sign or
poster without the permission of the person posting the notice, or if unknown,
the Chief of Police or the Mayor.
      (2)   It shall be a violation of this code for any person to use or
occupy any real or personal property which has been posted as unsafe for human
occupancy or use in accordance herewith.
   (F)   Nuisance resumed. The city shall not be required to issue a second or
subsequent abatement notice where the nuisance is at first abated, but later

nuisance after the time limit stated in the notice has expired irrespective of
whether a charge is filed alleging violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Methods of abatement.
      (1)   If abatement, is authorized under this chapter, the city may abate
or remove the nuisance in any and all of the following manners, except as may
be otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction:
         (a)   Proceeding to abate or remove the nuisance using city employees

structure, abatement may, as appropriate, be by demolition or repair of a
structure or causing the demolition or repair of a structure;
         (b)   Any other manner allowed by law or in equity or reasonable under
the circumstances; or
         (c)   Any manner authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   The proposed method of abatement shall not limit the method of
abatement which may be used unless otherwise ordered by the court or diminish
the discretion of the court to order that the person charged abate a nuisance
or enter any other appropriate order.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-22-2016)
§ 95.04 SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   Whenever, in the opinion of the officer of the city entitled to give notice
pursuant to this chapter, the maintenance or continuation of a nuisance creates
an imminent threat of serious or unreasonable injury to person or serious or
unreasonable damage to personal or real property, the officer may immediately
proceed to abate the nuisance in any reasonable manner if circumstances do not
allow implementation or full implementation of ordinary abatement procedures as
set forth in §
95.02. Whenever the owner, occupant, agent or person in possession, charge or
control of the real or personal property which has become a nuisance is unknown
or cannot readily be found or circumstances do not allow, the officer may
proceed to abate the nuisance without notice. Any reasonable order may be
entered by the official to abate a nuisance summarily when circumstances
require and may include, but shall not be limited to, prohibiting occupancy of
a structure. A copy of the order or other notice thereof may be posted on the
real or personal property involved. It shall be unlawful for any person to
disobey, remove or deface any order or notice. Where the abatement of the
nuisance requires continuing acts by the corporate authorities beyond the
initial summary abatement or any other additional summary abatement, it may
seek abatement of the nuisance on a permanent basis through a court order as
soon as reasonably possible.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-22-2016)
§ 95.05 RECOVERY OF ABATEMENT COSTS.
   (A)   Generally. Whenever the city is required to abate or remove a nuisance
pursuant to this chapter or as otherwise allowed by ordinances of the city, the
costs or expenses shall be a lien on the property to which they apply. If the
property is personal property, the lien shall be on the real estate on which or
at which the personal property is located. The city may collect the costs and
expenses thereof in accordance with this section, in accordance with ILCS Ch.
65, Act 5, § 11-20-15, or by use of the Local Debt Recovery Program
administered by the State of Illinois.
   (B)   Determination of costs. The determination of costs of abatement shall
be made by the City Clerk or his or her designee. The determination shall equal
the actual costs of abatement or removal provided that the costs, if performed
by employees of the city, shall not be less than $150 total. The costs of
abatement shall also include the actual costs of mailing or serving documents,
recording documents and any other incidental expenses.
   (C)   Notice of cost. Within 60 days after the costs or expenses are
incurred to abate or remove a nuisance, the City Clerk or his or her designee
shall give, or cause to be given, a statement notifying the person to whom or
which the notice to abate a nuisance was sent, setting forth the cost or
expenses incurred by the city to abate or remove the nuisance. The notice shall
also identify the parcel by common description and describe the removal or
abatement activity, The notice shall include a copy of ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, §
11-20-15 and of this section. The notice shall be served personally or by
certified mail upon the person to whom the tax bill for general taxes was sent
for the tax year immediately preceding the removal activity.
   (D)   Notice of lien. Within 60 days after the City incurs cost and expense
in abatement of any nuisance, the city or any person performing the service by
authority of the city, in his, her or its own name, shall be entitled to a lien
upon the real estate affected, superior to all other liens and encumbrances
except tax liens, and prior recorded liens or encumbrances in reference to
grass and weed cutting and superior to all subsequent liens and encumbrances,
except tax liens, in reference to abatement of all other nuisances. A notice of
lien shall be filed within 60 days in the office of the County Recorder.
      (1)   The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out the
following:
         (a)   A description of the real estate sufficient for identification
thereof;
         (b)   The amount of money representing the cost and expenses incurred
or payable for the service; and
         (c)   The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by the
municipality.
      (2)   The notice of the lien shall be enforced and may be released in the
manner which is provided by the applicable statute. A copy of the lien notice
shall be sent by certified mail to the person to whom was sent the tax bill for
the general taxes on the property for the last preceding year. Attached to any
such notice shall be a copy of ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-7 as well as a copy
of the applicable provision of this chapter. For purposes of this division (D),
the notice of cost, as provided in division (C) of this section, when sent or
delivered as aforesaid shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of the
notice of lien as provided herein.
   (E)   Certification. If the notice of cost is not paid within 30 days after
the date thereof, the City Clerk or his or her designee may certify the same to
the County Clerk of the county or place the matter for collection with the
Local Debt Recovery Program administered by the State of Illinois. The
certification shall contain, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the
City Clerk, the name of the owner of the real estate as disclosed on the tax
records of the county, a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification thereof, the real estate tax number of the real estate and the
amount of the costs and expenses incurred. In determining the last date for
filing the certification, the last date of payment within the 30 days
prescribed shall apply rather than the date the work is performed or the notice
originally given. The amount so certified shall be deemed to be levied by the
city as an individual assessment against the property involved. No further
action need be taken by the corporate authorities to levy the amount.
   (F)   Extension of assessment. The County Clerk of the county shall extend,
in the same manner as other taxes relative to real estate, an individual
assessment equal to the total of the amount certified to the County Clerk by
the City Clerk of the city. The assessment shall be collected in the same
manner as other taxes and paid to the city.
   (G)   Recorded notice of assessment. In addition to filing the above
certificate with the County Clerk, the City Clerk, if not collecting through
the Local Debt Recovery Program administered by the State of Illinois, shall
cause a notice of the assessment to be filed in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds in the county at that time. The notice shall certify the description of
the real estate sufficient for identification thereof and the amount of the
assessment. The recorded copy of the certification to the County Clerk shall be
considered sufficient.
   (H)   Bona fide purchasers. The claim of the City pursuant to these
provisions shall not be valid as to any purchasers for good and sufficient
value and without notice whose rights in and to the real estate have arisen
subsequent to the abatement or removal of the nuisance and prior to the filing
of the notice with the Recorder of Deeds in the county. If the City Clerk is
notified of the existence of a bona fide purchaser for value, the Clerk, or the
Clerk’s designee, shall, if satisfied that the purchaser is bona fide, abate
the individual assessment. The assessment may also be abated if earlier paid.
Notice of abatement shall be filed with the County Clerk and Recorder of Deeds
of the county. The abatement shall not terminate any claim against the prior
owner of the real estate.
   (I)   Other remedies. The above divisions shall not limit any other remedies
of the city to collect costs or expenses. A court may, when considering a
charge of violating this chapter, order payment of the charges incurred by the
city, including attorney’s fees incurred by the city. The city may also enforce
a lien as in cases of foreclosure.

Further, no owner, lessee or in apparent control, possession, or charge of any

provided in this code or any other ordinance, statute, law, rule or regulation
regarding the subject matter of this chapter. These remedies are deemed
cumulative. In addition to the foregoing, a violation may be charged under the
provisions of this chapter regardless of whether a notice to abate a nuisance

as shall be requested by the respective units of government or educational

Electric Safety Code, the National Electric Code, and National Bureau of
Standards (what is commonly known as the Bell Blue Book) as affects the
construction, installation, and maintenance of electrical supply and
communication lines and attachments and supports. To the extent that these are
inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise or state or local law, then
the more stringent shall govern in order to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare.
   (B)   It shall be the duty of a franchisee to devise and implement a
preventative maintenance program for the cable system in order to insure that
there is no material degradation of the cable system that would affect the

cable services being provided. Before the franchisee implements such a program,
it shall be reviewed and approved by the Board.
   (C)   All wires, conduits, cable, and other property and facilities of a
franchisee shall be so located, constructed, installed, and maintained so as
not to endanger or unnecessarily interfere with usual and customary use,
traffic, and travel upon the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways
of the community.
   (D)   In the event a franchisee's system creates a hazardous or unsafe
condition or an unreasonable interference with property, then at its own
expense the franchisee shall voluntarily, or upon the request of the city,

or welfare.
   (F)   It shall be the responsibility of a franchisee (acting alone or in

or independent contractors of a franchisee install cable in a marketed-off
area.
   (G)   A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit, temporarily remove, raise, or lower the cable to allow the
moving of the building. The expense of temporary removal shall be borne by the
person requesting it, and the franchisee may require advance payment. The
franchisee shall be given not less than ten days advance notice in order to
facilitate the temporary cable changes.
   (H)   A franchisee, at either its own expense or that of a private
contractor, shall protect rights-of-way and easements and support or
temporarily disconnect or locate in the same street or other public way, any
property of the franchisee when necessitated by reason of traffic conditions;
public safety; a street closing; street construction or resurfacing; change or
establishment of street grade; installation of sewers, drains, water pipes,

construction permits from the city.

with a housing density of 20 passings/homes per street mile, or fractional
equivalent thereof at the prevailing installation charge throughout the rest of
the system.
   (L)   A franchisee shall not deny service or otherwise discriminate against
subscribers, its employees, or citizens on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, age, gender, or sexual preference. A franchisee shall comply
at all times with all other applicable, federal, state, and local laws relating
to nondiscrimination.

schematic drawings of facilities which may be reviewed and inspected by the
city or its designee.

§ 112.053 PURCHASE OF SYSTEM.
   (A)   In the event a renewal of a franchise is denied or is otherwise
terminated and the city acquires ownership of the cable system or effects a
transfer of ownership to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall
be at fair market value determined on the basis of the cable system as a going
concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself, consistent with
applicable federal law.

right of first refusal in the event the franchisee decides to sell its cable
system.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.054 TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   To protect the rights and interest of the city under any franchise
agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter, a franchisee shall not
consummate any conditional sales contract, transfer, assignment, or merger of
assets, or otherwise transfer control of the cable system without obtaining
prior city consent. If the franchise agreement gives the city a right of first
refusal in such a situation, the city shall first be notified pursuant to such
contractual provisions. If the city has no such right of first refusal or
elects not to exercise it, the franchisee shall not consummate the transaction
without adherence to the following procedures:
      (1)   The franchisee shall file an application with the city for its
consent pursuant to the requirements of §§
112.020 et seq. of this chapter, which application shall supply all pertinent
information relevant to the proposed transaction, including, among other
things, a copy of the purchase agreement and full details on the proposed
transferee and any plans it may have for the operation of the cable system;
      (2)   The City Council or other designated authority shall hold a public
hearing to determine the potential effect of the proposed transaction on the
city and the cable subscribers and to address the qualifications of the
transferee. If the city determines that the transferee is qualified and the
transaction is otherwise in the public interest, it shall approve the proposed
transfer; and
      (3)   Following the approval, the city and the transferee shall enter
into an amendment to the franchise agreement pursuant to which the city
formally approves the transfer and the transferee agrees to be bound by all
terms and conditions of the franchise agreement.
   (B)   Prior approval shall not be required where the proposed transaction
does not effect a substantial change in control of the franchisee. However, the
city must be notified of the proposed transaction together with all pertinent
details at least 30 days in advance of the date of consummation. Unless
demonstrated to the contrary, it will be assumed that any change involving a
transfer in ownership or control of more than 25% of the stock or other
controlling interest in the franchisee will constitute a substantial change in
control requiring prior city consent.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.055 RECEIVERSHIP, FORECLOSURE, AND THE LIKE.
   A franchise granted by the city shall, at the option of the city, cease and
terminate 90 days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee
or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the franchisee, whether in
a receivership reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding,
unless such receivership or trustee shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of the 90 days or unless the following occur:

limitation of the franchise agreement. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property, and equipment of the system, or any part
thereof, the city may serve notice of termination upon the franchisee and the
successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and
privileges thereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of the
notice, unless the following occur:
      (1)   The city shall have approved the transfer of the franchise pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter; and
      (2)   The successful bidder shall have entered into an agreement with the
city to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise

   At any time the FCC or another federal or state agency requires or requests

any controversy or dispute between the franchisee and the city arising out of
the enforcement or interpretation of any provision of this chapter, the
franchise agreement, or any rule, regulation, or procedure relating to cable
communication matters. Fact finding and mediation shall be the means of
resolving the great majority of such controversies or disputes. Only those
matters specifically designated as arbitrable may be submitted to that process
for binding resolution. None of these methods, however, shall be the first
resort of the parties, but shall be undertaken only after reasonable efforts
have been made to reach agreement by negotiation.
   (B)   Any controversy or dispute, upon the election of either the city or
the franchisee, shall be submitted to an expert individual acceptable to both
parties for an investigation of the facts and a report thereof. Such fact
finding shall be for the purpose of developing better information for the use
of both parties and shall not be binding on either party. All fees and other
expenses resulting from such fact finding shall be equally borne by both the
city and the franchisee.
   (C)   Any controversy or dispute, upon the election of either the city or
the franchisee, may be submitted to an expert individual acceptable to both the
franchisee and the city for the purpose of facilitating discussion and
receiving new perspectives on the issues and new proposals for compromise. Such
mediation shall not be binding on either party. All fees or expenses resulting
from such mediation shall be equally borne by both the city and the franchisee.
   (D)   Unless both parties agree, only those matters which are expressly
arbitrable under the provisions of the franchise agreement or this chapter may
be submitted for arbitration. Such matters shall include disputes over the fair
market value of the system. Arbitrable matters may be submitted to a single
expert individual, if both parties agree to do so. Otherwise, arbitrable
matters shall be submitted pursuant to the provisions of Illinois law relating
to Arbitration and Award. All fees or other expenses resulting from such
arbitration shall be paid by the city and the franchisee as hereinafter
provided.
   (E)   The fees of single experts and arbiters shall be jointly borne by the
franchisee and the city. The fee of an arbiter who represents one of the
parties shall be borne by that party. The fee for the umpire shall be jointly
borne by the franchisee and the city. The expenses of fact finding and
mediation shall be jointly borne by the franchisee and the city.
   (F)   The expenses of arbitration shall be borne as determined by the
arbitration panel in its award of finding, but in no event shall the city be
obligated for more than one-half of the expenses.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.059 INSURANCE, BONDS, AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   The franchisee shall indemnify and hold harmless the city at all times
during the term of the franchise and specifically agrees that it will pay all
damages and penalties which the city may be legally required to pay as a result
of the franchisee's actions or inaction in constructing, operating,
maintaining, repairing, or removing the system, in carrying on the franchisee's
business or operations in the city, or in exercising or failing to exercise any
right or privilege granted in the franchise agreement. The damages and penalty
shall include, but not be limited to, damages arising out of copyright
infringements and other damages arising out of the installation, operation, or
maintenance of the cable system, whether or not any act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the franchise agreement. In the
case suit shall be filed against the city, either independently or jointly with
the franchisee, to recover for any claim or damages, the franchisee, upon
notice to it by the city, shall defend the city against the action and, in the
event of a final judgment being obtained against the city, either independently
or jointly with the franchisee, solely by reason of the acts of the franchisee,
the franchisee will pay the judgment and all costs and hold the city harmless
therefrom. The city shall promptly notify the franchisee of any claims subject
to indemnification by the franchisee and shall cooperate with all reasonable
requests by the franchisee for information, documents, testimony, or other
assistance appropriate to a resolution of such claims. The franchisee shall
have the right to control and approve any action directed toward settlement of
such claims.
   (B)   Upon the effective date of the franchise agreement, the franchisee
shall furnish proof of the posting of a faithful performance bond running to
the city with good and sufficient surety approved by the city, in the initial
sum of $250,000; however, at the end of each of the first five years of the
franchise term, the bond shall be reduced in $25,000 increments per year for
each year of faithful performance (including during which no amounts of the
bonds shall have been recovered by the city as damages). Thereafter, the amount
of the bond shall be maintained at its minimum of $125,000 throughout the
remainder of the term of the franchise. Written evidence of the payment of the
establishment and maintenance of the bond shall be filed with the city.
   (C)   A franchisee shall be required to maintain insurance in such forms and
in such companies as shall be approved by the city, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, to protect the city and the franchisee from and against
any and all claims, injury, or damage to persons or property, both real and
personal, caused by the construction, erection, operation, or maintenance of
any aspect of the system. The amount of such insurance shall not be less than
the following:
      (1)   General liability insurance.
      Bodily injury per person: $3,000,000.
      Bodily injury per occurrence: $5,000,000.

      Property damage per occurrence: $1,000,000.
   (D)   Workmen’s compensation insurance shall also be provided as required by
the laws of the state. All such insurance shall name the city as an additional
insured and shall provide a ten day notice to the City Clerk in the event of
material alteration or cancellation of any coverage afforded in the policies
prior to the date the material alteration or cancellation shall become
effective. Copies of all policies required hereunder shall be furnished to and
filed with the City Clerk prior to the commencement of operations or the
expiration of prior policies as the case may be.
   (E)   Neither the provisions of this section, nor any damage recovered by
the city hereunder shall be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by a
franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under this chapter or the
franchise agreement for damages.

§ 112.075 RATES SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATION.
   Rates subject to regulation by the city include rates for the basic cable
television service plus the leased equipment necessary for the rendition of
basic service (including converter boxes, remote control units, and wiring) and
installation and extra set charges.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.076 RATE CHANGES AND DISCRIMINATION.
   (A)   Unless approved by the city and to the extent consistent with federal
law, no franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the
services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant
undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any subscriber or potential
subscriber to the system, including preferences based on the geographic
location of the subscriber, or to any user or potential user of the system, nor
subject any such person to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee may afford reasonable discounts for
senior citizens and other economically disadvantaged groups.
   (B)   Rates may be changed by the franchisee following a minimum 30 days
prior notice to the city and the subscribers.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.077 RATE REGULATION.
   (A)   Upon certification of the city by the FCC to institute rate
regulation, the following procedures shall apply to those rates that are
subject to local regulation:
      (1)   When the city desires to initially review the basic service rates
and other rates subject to local regulation under federal law, it shall notify
the franchisee to file its schedule of rates with the city within 30 days of
the receipt of such notice together with the data and information necessary to
determine whether the rates meet the FCC rate standards. Such supporting
information shall include, at minimum, the completed worksheets of FCC Form 393
or successor forms and all relevant supporting information and notes;
      (2)   When the franchisee desires to increase rates subsequent to the
initial rate review, it shall submit to the city the revised rate schedule
together with data and supporting information necessary to determine whether
the new rates meet the FCC rate standards. Before filing for such rate
increases, the franchisee shall give notice to its subscribers as required
herein and by FCC rules; and
      (3)   If the city finds that the rates submitted by the franchisee are
consistent with FCC rate standards following the procedure specified below, it
shall so notify the franchisee within 30 days of the filing of the rates and
any rate increases will become effective on the thirty-first day after their
filing. If the city cannot find the rates are reasonable under the FCC
standards within the 30-day period, it shall so notify the franchisee and may
issue a brief order postponing the effectiveness of any rate increases for up
to an additional 90 days; provided, however, if the franchisee is depending on
a cost of service study to demonstrate reasonableness, the city may postpone
the effectiveness of any rate increase for up to an additional 150 days.
   (B)   Members of the public and other interested parties may file written
comments with the city within 14 days of the date a franchisee files its rates
for initial review or for review of a rate increase. The city shall schedule a
public hearing on rates before it for review following appropriate advance
announcement to the public and the franchisee. Whenever the city disapproves
rates or rate increases, in whole or in part, or approves rates over the
objections of interested parties, it shall do so by written order explaining
its reasons and provide public notice thereof.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.078 REMEDIES.
   Whenever the city disapproves a schedule of rates upon initial review or
subsequent rate increases, it may employ any combination of the following
remedies:
   (A)   A prospective reduction in rates may be ordered consistent with FCC
rate standards or the results of a cost of service study;
   (B)   New rates may be prescribed by the city to bring rates found to be
unreasonable into compliance with FCC rate standards or a cost of service
study;
   (C)   The city may, consistent with division (D) in this section, order the
franchisee to refund to subscribers an amount by which rates are found to be
unreasonable under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   As part of the initial review of rates;
      (2)   When the franchisee has failed to comply with a rate decision and
has continued to charge unreasonable rates; or
      (3)   Where the city has tolled a prospective rate increase for 90 or 150
additional days (as applicable) and the rate increase later found to be
unreasonable has gone into effect; or
   (D)   When refunds may become applicable, the city shall issue a brief order
when the tolled rates go into effect directing the franchisee to keep accurate
account of all amounts paid by individual subscribers relative to the rates in
question (an accounting order). The period for which refunds may be ordered
shall not exceed one year. Before ordering a refund, the city must give the
franchisee prior notice and an opportunity to make a presentation, either
orally in a hearing context or by paper filings. Refunds shall include interest
computed at the rate used by the Internal Revenue Service for refunds and
additional tax payments. Normally, refunds shall be made to individual
subscribers that paid the unreasonable charges. However, where no accounting
order has been issued or the franchisee can demonstrate that such specific
refunds will entail undue burden compared with the amount of the refund, the
city may authorize a one time credit to all subscribers of the class that paid
the unreasonable rates.

§ 112.079 CONFLICTS AND INTERPRETATIONS.
   If any provision in this chapter shall be determined to be in conflict with
a rule, regulation, policy, or order of the FCC, then in that circumstance the
FCC requirement shall take precedence over the requirement of this chapter. If
any requirement of this chapter shall have ambiguity in interpretation or in
applicability, it shall be interpreted in a way that is consistent with FCC
rules, requirements, and opinions.

FRANCHISE FEES
§ 112.090 FEES.
   (A)   Any franchisee awarded a franchise or renewed franchise shall pay to
the city for the privilege and use of the streets, rights-of-way, easements,
and public ways, and other facilities of the city in the operation of a cable
system, and for the city's supervision thereof during the term of the
franchise, a sum equal to 5% of the annual gross revenues derived from and
attributable to the operation of the system within the city.
   (B)   It is intended that the franchise fee will promote the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the community in part by providing funding for
community-oriented cable programs, projects, and services, and to allow and
provide for the necessary regulation of a franchisee's activities and its use
of the streets, public ways, rights-of-way, and easements. Therefore, 3%, which
represents 60% of the total franchise fee collected, shall be deposited into
the general revenues of the city. Further, 2%, which represents 40% of the
total collected, shall be set aside for the Authority to assist in its
regulatory and advisory roles with respect to cable.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.091 QUARTERLY REPORT.
   A franchisee shall file with the city quarterly a report of its gross
revenues attested to by an officer of the franchisee within 45 days of the end
of its fiscal quarter. A franchisee shall file with the city within 90 days
after the expiration of each of the franchisee's fiscal year, a detailed
financial and revenue statement clearly showing the gross revenues received by
such franchisee subject to the franchise fee during the preceding year, and
certified by a certified public accountant or officer of a franchisee attesting
to the accuracy, completeness, and veracity of the revenue figures.

§ 112.092 PAYMENT OF QUARTERLY FEE.
   (A)   Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be
rendered to the city at the time the revenue statement is filed.
   (B)   In the event that payment is not made within 45 days after the date
specified in this subchapter, then such failure shall be a material breach of
this chapter which shall entitle the city to terminate the franchise agreement
pursuant to §§
112.004 through
112.007 of this chapter.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.093 AUDIT.
   The city reserves the right to audit a franchisee's books if the city deems
it necessary in order to carry out its regulatory duties. All reports due and
pertaining to the payment of franchise fees will be certified as to their
accuracy and veracity by an officer of the franchisee, and the franchisee shall
maintain for a period of three years records used in the preparation of the
reports to be produced in their originality and totality upon request or demand
by the city. If the audit discloses that franchise fees have been underpaid in
any year by an amount greater than 5%, then the franchisee shall reimburse the
city's expenses of performing the audit.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
CUSTOMER PROTECTION; SERVICE STANDARDS
§ 112.105 CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARD.

the availability of an A/B or input selector switch; the availability of rules
and procedures for use of public access channels; and the additional rights and

§ 112.106 LOCAL OFFICE.
   A franchisee shall maintain a customer service office within the city which
shall be open at least 40 hours per week (exclusive of holidays and disaster
emergencies). The office should have an adequate and knowledgeable staff in
order to handle the vast majority of customer service inquiries, specifically
including, but not limited to, billing inquiries, refunds, service outages,
equipment service and repair, payment of bills and other charges, inquiries
from disabled or physically-impaired customers, and inquiries concerning the
use of PEG facilities and equipment. In addition to a local telephone number, a
franchisee shall maintain at least one toll-free telephone number on a 24-hour
basis to facilitate calls concerning repair of equipment and extended
interruption of service. During any hours that the customer service office is
open, the franchisee must provide personnel to address a customer's inquiries.
During other hours, a telephone may be manned by an automatic answering device
which shall be regularly monitored.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)

(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.108 RESTORATION OF A SUBSCRIBER’S PROPERTY.
   If at any time a franchisee disturbs the yard, residence, or other real or
personal property of a subscriber, the franchisee shall ensure that the
subscriber's yard, residence, or other real or personal property is returned,
replaced, and/or restored to a condition that is comparable to its condition
before the disturbance. To the extent such corrective action cannot be
accomplished, the franchisee shall reimburse a subscriber, or private property
owner, for any damage caused by the franchisee, subcontractor, or independent
contractor, in connection with the disturbance of a subscriber's or other
person's property.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.109 EMERGENCY ALERT; STANDBY POWER.
   (A)   In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending,
imminent, or actual natural, man-made, or disaster emergency, the franchisee
shall insure that the cable system providing cable service to all or part of
the city is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the community to
override the audio portion of all channels, and simultaneously and without a
separate or additional effort activate a channel blanking function on all
channels by touch-tone phone (or functional equivalent) from any location.
Moreover, the franchisee shall, in the case of a disaster emergency, make the
entire cable system available without charge to the city or to any governmental
or civil defense agency that the city shall designate.
   (B)   In addition to any other requirements listed in this chapter, a
franchisee shall do the following:
      (1)   Cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency
alert override system; and
      (2)   Develop a plan, with the city's concurrence, on methods to provide
continuity of cable service and response to service calls in the event of a
natural, man-made, or disaster emergency.
   (C)   As one method of providing continuity of services in the event of a
natural, man-made, or disaster emergency, a franchisee shall, unless exempted
by the city, maintain equipment capable of providing automatic standby power
for a minimum of two hours strategically placed in locations along the cable
system trunk line in order to minimize the number of subscribers affected by
interruption of service.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.110 DISCONNECTION FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (A)   A subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in payment until at
least 30 days after the posting of the bill to the subscriber and payment has
not been received by the franchisee. Before disconnection of a subscriber's
cable service (either physically or electronically) takes place, the following
must occur: the subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment of cable
service; and at least eight days have elapsed after mailing a written notice of
impending disconnection or five days after personal service of such notice.
   (B)   The receipt of a bad check from a subscriber, in response to a written
notice of disconnection, does not constitute payment, and the franchisee need
not give the subscriber further notice prior to disconnecting cable service. A
franchisee may add a collection charge to the subscriber's bill as long as it
does not exceed any state or local law limits. Except in the case of a
disconnection and unless authorized by the subscriber, a franchisee shall not
apply a security deposit on the rental or lease of a specific piece of
equipment in order to satisfy a subscriber's past due or delinquent account.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.111 VOLUNTARY DISCONNECTION.
   (A)   At any time, a subscriber may request that a particular service tier,
service cluster, pay channel, premium channel, informational service, or the
entire cable service be discontinued.
   (B)   From the date that such a subscriber makes such a request, then the
franchisee shall have 72 hours or three service days, whichever is longer, to
disconnect the service tier, service cluster, pay channel, premium channel,
informational service, or entire cable service. In the event that a franchisee
does not disconnect service within 72 hours, a subscriber's obligation to pay
for such service shall cease.
   (C)   For a service tier, service cluster, premium channel, or informational
service which is voluntarily disconnected, a subscriber shall pay a pro rata
share of the monthly rate for such service or channel.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the above provisions, and in order to reduce
subscriber abuse of this voluntary disconnection policy, a subscriber shall be
charged a minimum one of one month’s full rate for any one service (basic,
premium, informational, cluster, or tier) which is disconnected at least three
times in a span of 180 days.
   (E)   Unless damage has occurred, no charge may be passed onto a subscriber
for the actual disconnection of a channel or service if the disconnection
involves a single residence with fewer than five outlets.
   (F)   However, if a franchisee's equipment has been damaged by a subscriber,
then the franchisee may charge the subscriber with the cost of a replacement,
provided that the franchisee notifies the subscriber within 20 service days of
the disconnection. A subscriber shall not be required to pay for equipment
failure if circumstances fall within the normal wear and tear of the equipment.
   (G)   Any refund due a subscriber after disconnection (both for nonpayment
and voluntary) shall be made within 60 days after such disconnection.

quality following an initial service call to the subscriber's residence, then
subsequent service calls to correct the problem shall be at no charge.
   (C)   A customer shall be responsible for any damage caused to equipment
rented or leased from a franchisee.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.113 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.
   The city declares that as part of its right to establish cable customer
service guidelines, it has the duty to ensure continuity of cable service for
all subscribers. The city may take appropriate measures in order to insure that
no portion of the city is threatened or faced with a disruption, interruption,
or discontinuance of cable service due to the actions of the franchisee.
Whenever any situation occurs which threatens the continuity of cable service,
then the city may direct the franchisee to take certain action reasonably
within in its power to insure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted cable service.
(Ord. 96-9, passed 2-26-1996)
§ 112.114 RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   A franchisee is required to develop a comprehensive complaint/inquiry
resolution policy that is consistent with the policies outlined in these
customer service practices. Before implementing the complaint/inquiry
resolution policy, the city shall review the policy together with any
amendments that might be added from time to time.
   (B)   A franchisee's resolution policy shall be reduced to writing, and such
policy shall be available upon request to any person.

calendar days following the date of the notice. If the franchisee does not
submit a renewal application by the specified date, it will be deemed not to be
seeking renewal of its franchise; and
   (C)   Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city shall publish notice
of its receipt and may schedule one or more public meetings or implement other
procedures under which comments from the public on the application may be
received.

cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of
meeting such needs and interests.

application, the Council must do either of the following:
   (A)   Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the
negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the city and the
franchisee; or
   (B)   Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed.

decision after its issuance.
   (C)   Based on the recommended decision, the comment and arguments
presented, and other evidence of record, the Council, following a public
hearing, shall make a final determination on whether to grant or deny the
renewal application. The city may not base a denial on a failure to
substantially comply with the material terms of a franchise unless the city has
provided notice to the franchisee of the violation(s) and given it an
opportunity to cure. The Council shall issue a written decision setting forth
the reasons for its decision.

§ 112.147 SECURITY FUND.
   (A)   Prior to a franchise or franchise renewal becoming effective, the
franchisee shall post with the city a cash security deposit in an amount as
determined by the city. The deposit is to be used as a security fund to ensure
the faithful performance of all provisions of law and the franchise agreement
and compliance with all orders, permits, and directions of the city and the
payment by the franchise of any fees, claims, liquidated damages, liens, or
taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or
maintenance of the system.
   (B)   The city shall place the security deposit in an interest bearing
account. The interest will accrue to the benefit of the franchisee but may not
be withdrawn during the franchise term and any renewal thereof. All interest
will be added to and become a part of the original security fund during the
term of the franchise and any renewal thereof.
   (C)   Within 30 days after notice to it that any amount has been withdrawn
from the security fund, the franchisee shall pay to or deposit with the city
funds sufficient to restore the security fund.
   (D)   If the franchisee fails to pay the city any compensation within the
time fixed herein; or fails after 30-days’ notice to pay the city any fees or
taxes due; or fails to pay or repay to the city within 30 days any damages,
costs, or expenses which the city shall be compelled to pay by reason of any
act or default of a franchisee in connection with the franchise agreement; or
fails after 30-days’ notice of such failure by the city, to comply with any
provisions of the franchise agreement which the city reasonably determines can
be remedied by an expenditure of the security, the city may immediately
withdraw the amount due with interest and any penalties from the security fund.
Upon such withdrawal, the city shall notify the franchisee of the amount and
date thereof. Within 30 days of the withdrawal, the franchisee shall replenish

§ 116.03 TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRA STRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEE.
   (A)   A city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is hereby
imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of 1.0% (fee may be

charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to service addresses within
the city or telecommunications originating or received in the city.
   (B)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this chapter, the city infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all public
rights-of-way within the city by telecommunications retailers. Imposition of
the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this chapter does not,
however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or imposition of any
fees otherwise authorized by law.
   (C)   The city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
by this section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as set forth in
§
116.04.

customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the city infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service address.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the City Council, the infrastructure
maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the
city not later than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in which
a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that the

shall contain such information as the City Council may reasonably require.
   (D)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by the
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the city. The charge imposed under division (A)
of this section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides the services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for such services.

has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as
a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then the amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this chapter from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the City Council may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three years

period of limitations; and the credit derives from an overpayment made by the
same telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.
   (F)   Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications retailers shall

and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
city for the city infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the
amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the city plus 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by
the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total

City within 21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.

additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of this
chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to time
and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered pursuant
to §

the extent waived.

may accrue after the effective date of the waiver, to the city by a
telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing city franchise, license,

is subject to being lawfully imposed and collected by the retailer and remitted

§ 117.01 PURPOSE; FINDINGS AND RATIONALE.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.

- 2003; Various Media Articles; and "Rural Hotspots: The Case of Adult
Businesses," 19 Criminal Justice Policy Review 153 (2008); the City Council
finds:
         (a)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses,
are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but
not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and
lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
         (b)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds
that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (C)   The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and
legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to
such secondary effects.

§ 130.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this title, the following words and phrases shall have
the following meanings ascribed to them respectively.

(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-4)
   OFFENSE. A violation of a penal statute of this city or state.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-12)
§ 130.02 INTENT.
   A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a
result or engage in conduct described by the section defining the offense, when
his or her conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or
engage in that conduct.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-4)
§ 130.03 KNOWLEDGE.
   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct,
described by the section defining the offense, when he or she is consciously
aware that his or her conduct is of that nature or that those circumstances
exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the substantial
probability that the fact exists;
      (2)   The result of his or her conduct, described by the section defining
the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that that result is
practically certain to be caused by his or her conduct; or
   (B)   Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed willfully,
within the meaning of a statute using the term “willfully,” unless the section
clearly requires another meaning.
   (C)   When the law provides that acting knowingly suffices to establish and
element of an offense, that element also is established if a person acts
intentionally.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-5)
§ 130.04 RECKLESSNESS.
    A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when that person consciously
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
that a result will follow, described by the section defining the offense; and
that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation. An act performed recklessly
is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a section using the term
“wantonly,” unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-6)
§ 130.05 NEGLIGENCE.
    A person is negligent, or acts negligently, when that person fails to be
aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a
result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense; and that
failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-7)
§ 130.06 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits the offense of attempt when,
with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act that
constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.
   (B)   Impossibility.  It is not a defense to a charge of attempt that
because of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been impossible
for the accused to commit the offense attempted.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 8-4(a), (b)
   (C)   Statutory fine. A person convicted of an attempt may be fined not to
exceed the maximum provided for the offense attempted. If such fine exceeds
that set forth in §
130.99 below, however, the city shall enforce said offense under the provisions
of state law.
Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.99 PENALTY.

   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity when, with
knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he or she:
      (1)   Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver,

      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:
      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;
      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
         (c)   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other merits
of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)   Permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer an intent to
disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement, or possession of a mold,
engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 11-20(a) - (f)) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 134.03 HARMFUL MATERIAL.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. No person, with knowledge that a person is a
child (that is, a person under 18 years of age), or who fails to exercise
reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, shall knowingly
distribute to, send, or cause to be sent to, or exhibit to, or offer to
distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child.
   (B)   Definitions. For purposes of this section:
      (1)   HARMFUL. Material is harmful if, to the average person, applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or
excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming
social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
      (2)   MATERIAL. Any writing, picture, record, or other representation or
embodiment.
      (3)   DISTRIBUTE. To transfer possession of, whether with or without
consideration.
      (4)   KNOWINGLY. Having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter,
or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have
disclosed the contents thereof.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall
be judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the
child to whom the material was offered, distributed, sent, or exhibited, unless
it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its
dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially
susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall
be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
      (2)   In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of
production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity
indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of
the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   (D)   Affirmative defenses.
      (1)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years of age, provided such
circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational purpose, and it
shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a violation of this
section that the act charged was committed in aid of legitimate scientific or
educational purposes.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing
to his or her child any harmful material.
      (3)   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown, and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child, shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: a document issued by
the federal government or any state, county, or city government or subdivision
or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's
license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service
Act or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces.
      (4)   In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in
this section culminates in the sale or distribution of harmful material to a
child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the
child by the defendant, his or her employees, or agents, as where the order or
request for harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or similar
means of communication, and delivery of the harmful material to the child was
by mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this section that the advertisement contained
the following statement, or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that
the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he or she was not under 18
years of age and that the purchaser falsely stated that he or she was not under
18 years of age: “NOTICE: It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age
to purchase the matter herein advertised. Any person under 18 years of age who
falsely states that he or she is not under 18 years of age for the purpose of
obtaining the material advertised herein, is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor
under the laws of the state of Illinois and a violation of §
134.03 of the City Code of Ordinances.”
   (E)   Child falsifying age.  
      (1)   No person under 18 years of age shall falsely state, either orally
or in writing, that he or she is not under the age of 18 years, or present or
offer to any person any evidence of age and identity which is false or not
actually his or her own for the purpose of ordering, obtaining, viewing, or
otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any harmful material.
      (2)   A person over the age of 18 who fails to exercise reasonable care
in ascertaining the true age of a minor, knowingly distributes to, or sends, or
causes to be sent, or exhibits to, or offers to distribute, or exhibits any
harmful material to a person that he or she believes is a minor is guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor. If that person utilized a computer web camera, cellular
telephone or any type of device to manufacture the harmful material, then each
offense is a Class 4 felony.
      (3)   Telecommunications carriers, commercial mobile service providers,
and providers of information services, including, but not limited to, Internet
service providers and hosting service providers, are not liable under this
section, except for willful and wanton misconduct, by virtue of the
transmission, storage, or caching of electronic communications or messages of
others by virtue of the provision of other related telecommunications,
commercial mobile services, or information services used by others in violation
of this section.

(Ord. 2013-17, passed 9-23-2013)
§ 152.11 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Board of
Appeals for a variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
City Council. The City Council may attach such conditions to granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (B)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (C)   The City Council shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance
from the requirements of the building protections standards of §
152.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (D)   Variances to the building protection requirements of §
152.07 which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in “historic
structure”, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements
of §§
152.06 and
152.07 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.

§ 152.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.

§ 152.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City
Council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including: Ordinance 89-5, passed April 24, 1989. However, this chapter does
not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility
in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinances easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlay,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Municipal Attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Municipal Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The city shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (B)   The Municipal Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
      (1)   The Municipal Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in
writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if
necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The
stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (2)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeal. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the compliant, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (3)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

such utility easement in accord with any city ordinances governing construction
of driveways, the lot owner assumes all responsibility to pay for repair and
maintenance thereof, including but not limited to repair or replacement if the
city undertakes any use of the utility easement allowed under the terms of the
utility easement, and acknowledges the city’s right to make any use of the
utility easement allowed under the terms of the utility easement without any
responsibility to or the consent from such lot owner other than as is required
by the terms of the utility easement.

§ 156.065 SITE PLAN REVIEW; INTENT.
   The City of Metropolis recognizes that the very nature of land development
creates potential for traffic congestion, overcrowding, adverse visual
environmental impacts, and health problems. The City seeks to ensure that any
location that must accommodate urban use shall be subject to Site Plan Review
by the Planning Commission. Site plan reviews shall help ensure that the
meaning and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Regulations, and all
portions thereof, are fully complied with. The Site Plan Review regulates the
development of structures and sites in a manner that considers the following
concerns:
   (A)   The balancing of landowners’ rights to use their land, with the
corresponding rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without
undue disturbances (e.g., noise, smoke, fumes, dust, odor, glare, storm water
runoff, and the like);
   (B)   The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within
the site, and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
   (C)   The protection of historic and natural environmental features on the
site under review, and in adjacent areas; and
   (D)   The stability of the built environment-particularly neighborhoods-by
promoting new development that is compatible with both existing development and
clearly identified natural resources.

construction on a lot in the zoning districts in which Site Plan Review is
applicable, unless site plan review approval has been granted by the
Administrative Official.

   (B)   Staff review: following application submittal, site plan reviews shall
be performed by the Administrative Official, or his or her designated appointee
(s), and all other department heads and agencies having jurisdiction over the

impact on the surrounding area.
   (C)   Planning Commission review/approval: the Planning Commission shall
perform their review at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning
Commission for which the item may be scheduled and shall adjourn and reconvene
as is determined necessary.

§ 156.143 VARIANCES; STANDARDS FOR CONSIDERATION.
   (A)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not grant any zoning variance
unless, based upon the evidence presented to them, they determine that:
      (1)   The applicant acquired his property in good faith and where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of his specific piece of
property at the time of the effective date of this code, or where by reasons of
exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary circumstances, that
the strict application of the terms of the zoning regulations actually prohibit
the use of this property in the manner similar to that of other property in the
zoning district where it is located;
      (2)   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purpose of §
156.140;
      (3)   Strict application of this chapter of which the variance is
requested would constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner
represented in the application;
      (4)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship and allow a
reasonable return on the property;
      (5)   The variance requested arises from such condition which is unique
to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same
zoning district and is not created by an action or actions of the property
owner or applicant;
      (6)   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other property within the district, and therefore, that a
variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (rezoning);
      (7)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the area where the premises in question are located, nor materially frustrate
implementation of this city’s comprehensive plan.
   (B)   In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions,
safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefited by the variance as may
be necessary to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such
variance upon other property in the neighborhood, and to carry out the general
purpose and intent of these regulations.

residential scale. Units should be designed with vertical and horizontal
offsets to break up rooflines, define private outdoor areas, allow greater
views, and admit light and air to unit interiors. Large, blank wall surfaces
should be avoided. Windows and projecting wall surfaces should be used to break
up larger wall surfaces and establish visual interest. The same level of
architectural design and quality of materials should be applied to all sides of
the building. The side and rear elevations, garages, carports, and all
accessory structures should maintain the same level of design, aesthetic
quality, and architectural compatibility;
   (B)   Unified control: all multifamily developments shall be under single
ownership, unless such multifamily development is a Condominium. All
multifamily developments and Condominiums shall contain trust indentures or
covenants establishing unified control of the installation and maintenance of
any common facilities or areas;

buildings;
   (D)   Access: All multifamily residential developments must have direct
vehicular access to collector or arterial streets. Multifamily residential
development shall not take access to local streets;
   (E)   Pedestrian circulation systems: sidewalks, walkways, and paths shall
provide physical separation from vehicles along all public and private streets
and within any parking area. Pedestrian systems should incorporate landscaping
details to increase the visual interest and character of the neighborhood.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 156.330 INTENT.
   The intent of this section is to provide for permissive and/or alternative
zoning procedures for the development of tracts of land under the continuing
and uninterrupted ownership of an individual or of a legally existing entity,
with such individual or entity having total control and dominion of all
development and uses made of such tract. A planned unit development (PUD)
allows mixed use development provided the total development density is not
greater than the maximum density permitted under the existing zoning
requirements. In addition, a planned unit development is encouraged to permit:
   (A)   A maximum choice in the types of uses available to the public by
allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application
of the other sections of this chapter;
   (B)   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities;
   (C)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features;
   (D)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development and design and the construction of aesthetic
amenities;
   (E)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings, and other
facilities;
   (F)   A use of land which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals, and welfare;
   (G)   Innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial development so
that growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type,
design, and layout of the buildings, and by the conservation and more efficient
use of open space ancillary to said buildings.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.331 DISTRICTS WHERE ALLOWED.
   Planned unit developments may be built in any zoning district, but only upon
the issuance of a special use permit which will require, for the life of the
special use, the continuing and uninterrupted ownership and control of
development and uses of the tract of land by one individual or single legally
existing entity.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.332 PERMISSIBLE DEVIATIONS FROM ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   The planned unit development concept is intended to afford both the
developer and the city considerable flexibility in formulating development
proposals. Consequently, to the extent indicated in this subsection, PUDs may
deviate from generally applicable ordinance requirements without a variance.
Any proposed deviation not listed below, however, shall require a variance.
   (A)   Mixed uses. PUDs may include all types of residential and commercial
structures, as well as other uses approved by the City Council; provided, that
in approving such mixed uses, the City Council may attach any conditions
necessary to protect the public welfare.
   (B)   Lot and structure requirements. In PUDs, the City Council may approve
any reasonable deviation from the lot and structure requirements of the
particular zoning district so long as the different uses within the PUD are
appropriately interrelated, and property abutting the PUD is adequately
protected from any potential adverse impacts of the development.
   (C)   Accessory uses. In PUDs the City Council may allow the developer to
disregard the usual restrictions on accessory uses other than the prohibition
against using an accessory structure as a dwelling.
   (D)   Location of parking/loading spaces. By permission of the City Council,
off-street parking and loading spaces in PUDs need not be located in accordance
with generally applicable requirements, except state handicap/disabled
accessible parking requirements.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)

of Appeals shall consider the following criteria:
         (a)   The extent to which the proposed development is consistent with
the city’s comprehensive plan and with the purposes of this subchapter and of
all other applicable codes and ordinances;
         (b)   The extent to which the proposed development deviates from the
regulations that are generally applicable to the property (including, but not
limited to, the use and lot and building regulations of the district), and the
apparent merits (if any) of said deviations;
         (c)   Whether the proposed design of the PUD makes adequate provisions
for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, off-street parking and loading,
separation of residential and commercial uses, open space, recreational
facilities, preservation of natural features, and so forth;
         (d)   The compatibility of the proposed PUD with adjacent properties
and surrounding area;
         (e)   Any other reasonable criteria that the Planning Commission or
Zoning Board of Appeals may devise.
      (2)   Decision by City Council. After the Planning Commission and Zoning
Board of Appeals have submitted their advisory report, the City Council, by
resolution, shall either approve or disapprove the PUD development plan. The
City Council’s decision to approve or disapprove is final, and not appealable
under this chapter.
      (3)   The City Council shall not approve any PUD development plan unless:
         (a)   The applicant has posted a performance bond or escrow deposit in
the amount equal to 50% of the cost of constructing the required improvements
as certified by a registered professional engineer of Illinois;
         (b)   The proposed PUD, as evidenced by the site development plan,
complies with all applicable codes;
         (c)   The proposed PUD public improvements meet the design
requirements of the City’s Land Development Code.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.334 CHANGES IN APPROVED PLANS.
   No changes shall be made to any approved PUD site development plan except as
follows:
   (A)   Minor changes, which do not substantially affect the design or intent
of the final site development plan and are required by engineering or other
circumstances not foreseen at the time the final site development plan was
approved, shall be submitted to the city upon written application to the
Administrative Official;
   (B)   All proposed changes will be reviewed by city staff and engineers and
written recommendations forwarded to the Administrative Official;
   (C)   Approval or denial of all minor changes shall be returned in writing
to the applicant by the Administrative Official;
   (D)   All other changes shall require a public hearing before the Planning
Commission and a resolution by the City Council;
   (E)   No approved change shall have any effect until it is recorded with the
Massac County Recorder of Deeds as an amendment to the recorded copy of the
site development plan.

(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
NONCONFORMING USES
§ 156.410 INTENT.
   The requirements imposed by this chapter are designed to guide the use of
land by encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible
with the predominant character of each of the various districts. Lots,
structures, and uses of land or structures that do not conform to the
requirements of the district in which they are located impede appropriate
development. For example, nonconformities are frequently responsible for heavy
traffic on residential streets, the overtaxing of parking facilities, the
emission of noxious fumes or excessive noise, and the lowering of property
values. The requirements of this subchapter are intended to alleviate such
existing potential problems by encouraging the gradual elimination of
nonconformities.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.411 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Vacant lots. Any vacant lot that does not conform to one or more of
the lot size (area, dimensions) requirements of the zoning district in which it
is located may be used in the manner indicated in divisions (B), (C), and (D)
of this section if such vacant lot:
      (1)   Is a lot of record on the date of the adoption of the ordinance
from which this chapter derives; and
      (2)   Has continuously remained in separate ownership from abutting
tracts of land throughout the entire period during which the creation of such
lot was prohibited by any applicable zoning or other ordinance.
   (B)   Agricultural district. In the “A” agricultural district, any structure
permitted in the district may be erected on any vacant nonconforming lot of the
type described in division (A) of this section if all the setback and off-
street parking requirements of the district are met.
   (C)   Residential districts. In any residential district, one single-family
dwelling and related accessory structures, but no other use, may be erected on
any vacant nonconforming lot of the type described in division (A) of this
section, provided all the setback and off-street parking regulations of the
particular district are met.
   (D)   Commercial and industrial districts. In the “I” industrial district
and in any commercial district, any structure permitted in the particular
district may be erected on any vacant nonconforming lot of the type described
in division (A) of this section if the setback and off-street parking
requirements of that district are met.
   (E)   Two or more lots in common ownership. If two or more lots or
combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage were of
record and in common ownership on the effective date of the ordinance from
which this chapter derives, and if one or more of those lots does not meet the
minimum lot width, depth and area requirements of the district in which it is
located, the land involved shall be considered an undivided parcel. No portion
of any such parcel shall be developed except in compliance with this chapter,
nor shall any such parcel be divided so as to create a lot that does not meet
the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.412 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Any lawful structure which exists on the effective date of the ordinance
from which this chapter derives but which could not be erected under the terms
of this chapter because of restrictions on lot size, height, setbacks, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following:
   (A)   Enlargement, alterations. No such structure shall be enlarged or
altered in any way which increases its nonconformity;
   (B)   Relocation. No such structure shall be relocated unless, after
relocation, it will conform to all the requirements of the district in which it
is relocated; and
   (C)   Reconstruction. If less than 50% of a nonconforming structure is
damaged, such nonconforming structure may be rebuilt as long as its non-
conformity is not increased. If 50% or more of a nonconforming structure is
damaged, such nonconforming structure may not be rebuilt. If rebuilding on the
site does occur, the only structure permitted in such a case is one which
conforms to requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. In all
instances, the percentage of damage shall be determined by the Administrative
Official.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.413 NONCONFORMING USES OCCUPYING A STRUCTURE.
   If any lawful use occupying a structure exists on the effective date of the
ordinance from which this chapter derives but would not be allowed under the
terms of this chapter, such use may lawfully continue, subject to the
following:
   (A)   Minor repair and maintenance. Minor repairs or routine maintenance to
structures and property, where nonconformities exist, are permitted. Work
estimated to cost more than 10% of the structural value of the structure to be
repaired, shall be prohibited unless authorized by the Administrative Official;
   (B)   Enlargement, alteration, reconstruction, relocation. No structure
housing a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, structurally altered,
reconstructed or relocated unless the use of the structure is changed to a
permitted use;
   (C)   Extension of use. No nonconforming use may be extended to any part of
the structure not intended or designed for such use, nor shall the
nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such structure;
   (D)   Change of use. A nonconforming use occupying a structure shall not be
changed except to a use permitted under the applicable zoning district
regulations; and
   (E)   Discontinuance of use-abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a
structure, or of a structure and premises in combination, is discontinued for
12 consecutive months, the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed.
Any discontinuance caused by government action, and without any contributing
fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be counted in calculating the length
of discontinuance.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.414 NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY.
   The requirements of this Article shall not apply to any change in an
existing structure or to any change in the use of a structure for which a
permit was issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this
chapter derives or any pertinent amendment thereto, provided that the work
authorized by such permit is completed within a reasonable time.

CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 156.425 INTENT.
   (A)   The provisions of this section are intended to protect property values
and enhance community appearance in keeping with the goals of the Comprehensive
Plan of the City of Metropolis. It is recognized that the appearance of
property has a direct bearing on the economic value of such property, as well
as on the economic value of adjacent and surrounding property. The appearance
of a single property affects not only surrounding property, but the cumulative
affect is to enhance or diminish the aesthetic quality of the entire city and
consequently the values of property within the city. It is further recognized
that the appearance of property not only has economic effects, but also affects
the general welfare, health and safety of city citizens. An aesthetically
pleasing environment is a clean, healthy and safe environment.
   (B)   The city recognizes the significance of the Central Business District
as an important cultural and commercial resource. The Central Business District
contains common building elements such as load-bearing brick walls, second
story bay windows, decorative brickwork, and cast iron thresholds. This Article
provides a procedure by which development of property within the Central
Business District may be reviewed and modified in order to enhance the
aesthetic beauty of the Central Business District and maintain the desirable
qualities of the District through clear architectural and appearance standards
and, consequently, the economic value of property and the general welfare of
the citizens.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.426 SPECIFIC PURPOSES.
   In addition to the general purposes and intent expressed above, this
subchapter is further intended to give effect to the following specific
purposes:
   (A)   To establish standards for the orderly development or redevelopment
within the Central Business District;
   (B)   To permit public involvement in the planning of private land uses
which have the potential for significant impact on the use and enjoyment of
surrounding property, or on the public resources and public facilities of the
city;
   (C)   To conserve and protect the taxable value of land and buildings in the
Central Business District;
   (D)   To preserve and protect the visual diversity of buildings in the
Central Business District and its pedestrian scale;
   (E)   To preserve, protect and encourage the development of buildings,
groups of buildings and development sites of distinguished architectural
character and appearance.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.427 APPLICATION.
   These standards shall apply to all exterior building renovation, new
construction or other exterior alterations to property in the “C-2” district
that requires a permit. No permit shall be issued except upon approval of a
site plan in conformance with the site plan review procedures and fees
established in §§
156.060 through
156.071 and the additional standards set forth in this subchapter.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.428 STANDARDS FOR DESIGN.
   The purpose of these standards is to establish a checklist of those items
that affect the physical aspect of the Central Business District. These
standards are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or variety, but
rather to assist in focusing on design principles that allow creativity with a
satisfactory visual appearance while promoting the purpose and intent of this
section.
   (A)   New construction- building components and design requirements.
      (1)   Architectural style. There are no restrictions on architectural
style.
      (2)   Entryways. Entryways must be recessed to a depth that does not
allow a door to swing onto the sidewalk, and must have a strong design
consistent with the architecture of the rest of the building. Elements of
strong entryway design include canopies, awnings, porticos, arcades, raised
cornice parapets over the door, peaked roof forms, arches, large windows, or
architectural details such as tile work and moldings that are integrated into
the building structure and design.
      (3)   Windows.
         (a)   Coverage and operability. Windows must cover no less than 50%,
nor more than 75% of the storefront area; windows must cover no less than 30%
nor more than 50% on the upper facade. At least 50% of all windows on the
second and higher floors must be operable.
         (b)   Orientation and placement. Windows must be vertical, with no
less than a 2:1 ratio of height to width. Storefront windows must start between
two and three feet above the sidewalk.
         (c)   Window signs. No more than 30% of the storefront windows may be
covered by signs. This restriction does not apply to signs permanently painted
on or etched into the window to serve as the business’ primary sign.
         (d)   Framing. All windows must include an architectural element that
frames the window.
         (e)   Shutters. All window shutters must have the dimensions of
operable shutters that makes the shutters appear to be operable even if the
shutters are permanently fixed in an open position.
      (4)   Cornice and fascia.
         (a)   At roofline. All buildings must have a well-defined cornice or
fascia that creates a strong roofline and visually caps the building, giving
the building a finished appearance and unifying the building with existing
structures within and adjacent to the Central Business District.
         (b)   At storefront. All buildings must have a storefront cornice
occurring between nine and 12 feet above the sidewalk in order to complement
the average height of storefront cornices on existing buildings.
      (5)   Roof styles. The shape of the roof is not limited; however, all
buildings must have a parapet that conceals the roof plane.
      (6)   Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware. On buildings not
located on a corner, all mechanical equipment or other utility hardware must be
located on the roof or in the rear yard and must be screened from view with
materials harmonious with the building. Such equipment or hardware on a corner
building must be located on the roof and screened from view with materials
harmonious with the buildings. Such equipment or hardware shall not be located
closer than six feet from any residential windows. No mechanical equipment or
hardware or screening materials on any building may be visible from the street
level.
      (7)   Side and rear building faces. All exterior surfaces visible from
the street must include architectural components found on the primary building
facade in order to tie the building together. Rear entrances are encouraged.
      (8)   Anti-monotony. New construction must avoid monotony in design by
having no more than 15 feet of blank wall length without an interruption by at
least two of the following: change in plane, change in texture or masonry

   (A)   Existing significant trees should be preserved to the maximum extent
practicable to act as buffers between adjoining developments and as site
amenities. For purposes of this Section, “significant” trees mean deciduous
trees with at least a 12-inch caliper measured diameter at breast height (DBH),
evergreen trees ten feet or more in height, or small hardwoods such as
dogwoods, redbuds or sourwoods whose diameters are eight inches DBH or more.
   (B)   Where preservation is not feasible, trees that are removed shall be
replaced on-site or elsewhere in the city. Additionally, existing vegetative
cover including native trees, shrubs, forbs, sedges, groundcovers, grasses, and
other flora should be preserved to the extent possible during development. Such
existing vegetation provides important wildlife habitat, erosion control, and
visual buffers within the landscape.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.511 TREE REPLACEMENT OR MITIGATION.
   If a “significant tree” is removed according to an approved tree
preservation plan or is removed or damaged during clearing, grading, or
construction, the applicant shall replace the removed or damaged tree as set
forth below. Replacement trees shall be the same or similar species to the
trees removed or damaged, or alternatively a species approved by the city. The
following mitigation options may be utilized in any combination at the city’s
discretion:
   (A)   Replacement on site: for every inch of tree caliper, measured at DBH,
removed or damaged, the applicant shall install a replacement tree or trees
measuring an equal caliper on site;
   (B)   Replacement on other sites: if the replacement trees cannot be
provided on-site, they may be provided off-site as follows. For every inch of
tree caliper, measured at DBH, removed or damaged, the applicant shall install
a replacement tree or trees measuring an equal caliper off-site at a location
approved by the city;
   (C)   Contribution to the city’s Tree-Replacement Fund: if tree-replacement
on or off-site is not practicable, the applicant may make a monetary
contribution to the city that is equal to the value of the tree removed as
determined by an independent appraiser retained by the city and paid for by the
developer.
(Ord. 2013-22, passed 11-25-2013)
§ 156.512 LANDSCAPE CREDIT.
   Any existing trees, on sites that are in appropriate locations and of
acceptable quality shall be credited towards fulfillment of any landscaping
provisions of this chapter, on a caliper inch per inch basis.
