ARTICLE IX. SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
Sec. 2-381. Prohibition on sexual harassment.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Marshall to prohibit harassment of
any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee,
municipal agency or municipal office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or municipal offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , § I, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-382. Definition of sexual harassment.
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         a.   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual's employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
         b.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         c.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
         a.   Verbal harassment: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
         b.   Non-verbal harassment: Suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
"catcalls," "smacking" or "kissing" noises.
         c.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         d.   Physical harassment: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         e.   Textual/electronic harassment: "Sexting" (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person."
(Ord. No. 20-07 , § II, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-383. Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator or the chief elected official of the municipality.
The employee experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual harassment must not
assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and
the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
      (4)   Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official
of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , § III, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-384. Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal office
shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee or official
due to a municipal employee's or official's:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy; or
      (2)   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in the terms or
conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation
for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a report made
in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected
from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State
Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower
protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits retaliatory
action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of
promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any
of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not
retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil
rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which she/he
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over
for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , § IV, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-385. Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual
harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to $5,000.00 per offense, applicable disciplinary actions or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , § V, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-386. Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the state officials and employees ethics act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State Police, a
state's attorney, the attorney general or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000.00 against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

Cross reference(s)—Definitions generally, §
1-2.
Sec. 14-42. Control of vicious or dangerous dogs; complaints; violations,
penalty.
   (a)   No dog shall be deemed vicious if it bites, attacks, or menaces a
trespasser on the property of its owner or harms or menaces anyone who has
tormented or abused it or is a professionally trained dog for law enforcement
or guard duties. Vicious dogs shall not be classified in a manner that is
specific as to breed. If a dog is found to be a vicious dog, the dog shall be
subject to enclosure.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which
has been found to be a vicious dog unless such dog is at all times kept in an
enclosure. The only time that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure
is if it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the
dog, or to comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, provided
that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a chain having a tensile
strength of 300 pounds and not exceeding three feet in length, and shall be
under the direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dog.
   (c)   Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not

   (d)   If the owner of the dog impounded under this section has not appealed
the impoundment order to the circuit court in the county in which the animal
was impounded within seven working days, the dog may be humanely dispatched. A
dog found to be a vicious dog shall not be released to the owner until the
administrator, an animal control warden or the director approves the enclosure
as defined in this section.
   (e)   No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog.
   (f)   It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance by
permitting any dangerous dog or other animal to leave the premises of its owner
when not under control by leash or other recognized control method.
   (g)   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this section; provided, that an attack or injury to a person occurs while the
dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this
section, each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in
accordance with 510 ILCS 5/8. It shall be the duty of the owner of such
exempted dog to notify the administrator of any change of address. In the case
of a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the administrator advised of the

from maintaining or permitting a dangerous or vicious dog, to abate the same,
and to enjoin the owner of such dog or other animal from permitting such animal
to leave his premises when not under control by leash or other recognized
control methods. Upon the filing of a complaint in the circuit court, the
court, if satisfied that a nuisance may exist, shall grant a preliminary
injunction with bond in such amount as the court may determine enjoining the
defendant from maintaining such nuisance. If the existence of the nuisance is
established, the owner of such dog or other animal shall be in violation of
this section, and, in addition, the court shall enter an order restraining the
owner from maintaining such nuisance and may order that such dog or other
animal be humanely dispatched.
   (i)   Violations; penalties.
      (1)   Any person violating or aiding in or abetting the violation of any
provision of this section or resisting, obstructing or impeding the
administrator or any authorized officer in enforcing this section, is guilty of
a petty offense for a first or second offense and shall be fined according to
the provisions of section
1-5 of this Code, and for a third and subsequent offense is guilty of a class C
misdemeanor. Each day a person fails to comply constitutes a separate offense.
The city attorney upon the report of any violation from the police department
shall cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted in the proper courts
without delay and to be prosecuted in the manner provided by law.
      (2)   If the owner of a dog subject to enclosure:
         a.   Fails to maintain or keep the dog in an enclosure;
         b.   The dog inflicts great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement or
permanent physical disability upon any other person or causes the death of
another person; and
         c.   The attack is unprovoked in a place where such person is
peaceably conducting himself and where such person may lawfully be; such owner
shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than the maximum provided in
subsection 1-5(a) of this Code for each such violation (each day a person fails
to comply shall constitute a separate violation) and shall be subject to a
sentence of imprisonment for not more than 30 days.

   (b)   Where portions of the foundation of an entire building or structure
rest directly upon, or are underlain by, medium or soft clay upon different
materials, or where the layers of such softer materials vary greatly in
thickness, the magnitude and distribution of the probable settlement shall be
investigated, and, if necessary, the allowable loads shall be reduced or
special provisions made in the design of the building or structure to prevent
serious differential settlements which will impair the safety of the structure.
   (c)   Where the bearing materials directly under a foundation overlie a
stratum having smaller allowable bearing values, such smaller values shall not
be exceeded at the level of such stratum. Computation of the vertical pressure
in the bearing materials at any depth below a foundation shall be made on the
assumption that the load is spread uniformly at an angle of 60 degrees with the
horizontal.

Sec. 18-185. Failure to abate.
   (a)   Demolition, repair or enclosure.
      (1)   The city attorney shall, when requested to do so by the mayor, the
mayor's designated representative or the city council, pursuant to section 11-
31-1(a) of the Illinois Municipal Code 1  apply to the circuit court (i) for an
order authorizing action to be taken with respect to a dangerous building if
the owner or owners of the building, including the lienholders of record, after
15 days written notice by mail or by personal service so to do, have failed to
put the building in a safe condition or to demolish it or (ii) for an order
requiring the owner or owners of record to demolish, repair or enclose the
building or to remove garbage, debris and other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy
substances or materials from the building. It is not a defense to the cause of
action that the building is boarded up or otherwise enclosed, although the
court may order the defendant to have the building boarded up or otherwise
enclosed.
      (2)   If the mayor, the mayor's designated representative or the city
council determines that any dangerous building fulfills the requirements for an
action by the city under the Illinois Abandoned Housing Rehabilitation Act 2  ,
the city may petition under that act in a proceeding brought under this
subsection.
   (b)   Money judgment. In any case where the city has obtained a lien under

Illinois Code of Civil Procedure 3  and upon obtaining a judgment, file a
judgment lien against all of the real estate of the owner or owners and enforce
that lien as provided for in Article XII of the Illinois Code of Civil
Procedure 4  .

representative or the city council determines, upon due investigation, that any
building or structure herein fails to conform to the minimum standards of
health and safety as set forth in the ordinances of this city, and the owner or
owners of such building or structure fails, after due notice as provided in
this article, to cause such property to so conform, the city attorney may,
pursuant to section 11-31-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code 5  , make
application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring compliance of such
ordinances or for such other order as the court may deem necessary or
appropriate to secure such compliance.

Sec. 18-186. Alternate actions.
In addition to the actions authorized by other sections of this article:
   (a)   Declaration of abandonment. In addition to any other remedy provided
by law, the city may, pursuant to section 11-31-1(d) of the Illinois Municipal
Code 1  , petition the circuit court to have property declared abandoned if:
      (1)   The property has been tax delinquent for two or more years, or
bills for water service for the property have been outstanding for two or more
years;
      (2)   The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession; and
      (3)   The property contains a dangerous or unsafe building.
The city may proceed under this subsection in a proceeding brought under the
previous section.
   (b)   Expedited removal of certain buildings. The city may use the
provisions of this subsection to expedite the removal of certain buildings that
are a continuing hazard to the community.
If a residential or commercial building is three stories or less in height as
defined by the city's building code, and the corporate official designated to
be in charge of enforcing the city's building code determines that the building
is open and vacant and an immediate and continuing hazard to the community,
then the official shall be authorized to post a notice not less than two feet
by two feet in size on the front of the building. The notice shall be dated as
of the date of the posting and shall state that unless the building is
demolished, repaired or enclosed, and unless any garbage, debris, and other
hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy substances or materials are removed so that an
immediate and continuing hazard to the community no longer exists, then the
building may be demolished, repaired, or enclosed, or any garbage, debris and
other hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy substances or materials may be removed,
by the city.
Not later than 30 days following the posting of the notice, the city shall do
all of the following:
      (1)   Cause to be sent, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a
notice to remediate to all owners of record of the property, the beneficial
owners of any Illinois land trust having title to the property, and all
lienholders of record in the property, stating the intent of the city to
demolish, repair or enclose the building or remove any garbage, debris or other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials if that action is not
taken by the owner or owners.
      (2)   Cause to be published, in a newspaper published or circulated in
the city, a notice setting forth (i) the permanent tax index number and the
address of the building, (ii) a statement that the property is open and vacant
and constitutes an immediate and continuing hazard to the community, and (iii)
a statement that the city intends to demolish, repair or enclose the building
or remove any garbage, debris, or other hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy
substances or materials if the owner or owners or lienholders of record fail to
do so. This notice shall be published for three consecutive days.
      (3)   Cause to be recorded the notice to remediate mailed under paragraph
(1) in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Clark County.
A person or persons with a current legal or equitable interest in the property
objecting to the proposed actions of the city may file his or her objection in
an appropriate form in a court of competent jurisdiction.
If the building is not demolished, repaired or enclosed, or the garbage, debris
or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials are not
removed, within 30 days of mailing the notice to the owners of record, the
beneficial owners of any Illinois land trust having title to the property, and
all lienholders of record in the property, or within 30 days of the last day of
publication of the notice, whichever is later, the city shall have the power to
demolish, repair or enclose the building or to remove any garbage, debris or
other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials.
The city may proceed to demolish, repair or enclose a building or remove any
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials under this subsection within a 120-day period following the date of
the mailing of the notice if the appropriate official determines that the
demolition, repair, enclosure or removal of any garbage, debris or other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials is necessary to remedy
the immediate and continuing hazard. If, however, before the city proceeds with
any of the actions authorized by this subsection, any person with a legal or
equitable interest in the property has sought a hearing under Section 11-31-1
(e) of the Illinois Municipal Code 2  before a court and has served a copy of
the complaint on the mayor of the city, then the city shall not proceed with
the demolition, repair, enclosure or removal of garbage, debris or other
substances until the court determines that that action is necessary to remedy
the hazard and issues an order authorizing the city to do so. If the court
dismisses the action for want of prosecution, the city must send the objector a
copy of the dismissal order and a letter stating that the demolition, repair,
enclosure, or removal of garbage, debris, or other substances will proceed
unless, within 30 days after the copy of the order and the letter are mailed,
the objector moves to vacate the dismissal and serves a copy of the motion on
the mayor of the city. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if the
objector does not file a motion and give the required notice, if the motion is
denied by the court, or if the action is again dismissed for want of
prosecution, then the dismissal is with prejudice and the demolition, repair,
enclosure, or removal may proceed forthwith.
Following the demolition, repair or enclosure of a building, or the removal of
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials under this subsection, the city may file a notice of lien against the
real estate for the cost of demolition, repair, enclosure or removal within 180
days after the repair, demolition, enclosure or removal occurred, for the cost
and expenses incurred, in the office of the recorder of deeds. This lien has
priority over the interests of those parties named in the notice to remediate
mailed under paragraph (1), but not over the interest of third-party purchasers
or encumbrancers for value who obtained their interests in the property before
obtaining actual or constructive notice of the lien. The notice of lien shall
consist of a sworn statement setting forth (i) a description of the real
estate, such as the address or other description of the property, sufficient
for its identification; (ii) the expenses incurred by the city in undertaking
the remedial actions authorized under this subsection; (iii) the date or dates
the expenses were incurred by the city; (iv) a statement by the corporate
official responsible for enforcing the building code that the building was open
and vacant and constituted an immediate and continuing hazard to the community;
(v) a statement by the corporate official that the required sign was posted on
the building, that notice was sent by certified mail to the owners of record,
and that notice was published in accordance with this subsection; and (vi) a
statement as to when and where the notice was published. The lien authorized by
this subsection may thereafter be released or enforced by the city as provided
in subsection (a).
   (c)   Hazardous substances and petroleum products on, in, or under abandoned
and unsafe property. The city may remove or cause the removal of, or otherwise
environmentally remediate hazardous substances and petroleum products, on, in,
or under any abandoned and unsafe property within the city. In addition, where
preliminary evidence indicates the presence or likely presence of a hazardous
substance or a petroleum product or a release or a substantial threat of a
release of a hazardous substance or a petroleum product on, in, or under the
property, the city may inspect the property and test for the presence or
release of hazardous substances and petroleum products. For purposes of this
subsection (c):
      (1)   "Property" or "real estate" means all real property, whether or not
improved by a structure;
      (2)   "Abandoned" means:
   (a)   The property has been tax delinquent for two or more years;
   (b)   The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession; and
      (3)   "Unsafe" means property that presents an actual or imminent threat
to public health and safety caused by the release of hazardous substances; and
      (4)   "Hazardous substances" means the same as in Section 3.215 of the
Environmental Protection Act 3  .
The city attorney shall, pursuant to Section 11-31-1(f) of the Illinois
Municipal Code 4  apply to the circuit court (i) for an order allowing the city
to enter the property and inspect and test the substances on, in, or under the
property; or (ii) for an order authorizing the city to take action with respect
to remediation of the property if conditions on the property, based on the
inspection and testing authorized in paragraph (i) indicate the presence of
hazardous substances or petroleum products.
   (d)   Remedy of fire hazards. The fire chief of the fire protection district
or any municipal official whose duty it is to investigate fires may make
investigations authorized by Sections 9 through 9e of the Illinois Fire
Investigation Act 5  . If such officer shall find that any building or
structure is so occupied or situated as to endanger persons or property, or by
reason of faulty construction, age, lack of repair, or for any other cause is
especially liable to fire or is liable to cause injury by collapsing or
otherwise, such officer shall order the dangerous condition removed or
remedied, and shall so notify the owner, occupant or other person interested in
the premises. Service of such notice may be made in person or by registered or
certified mail, and any person so notified may appeal from the decision of such
officer in the manner provided by law.

Sec. 18-201. Purpose.
This article is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the city by
the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8,
and 5/11-31-2) in order to accomplish the following purposes:
   (a)   To prevent unwise developments from increasing flood or drainage
hazards to others;
   (b)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (c)   To promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens from the hazards of flooding;
   (d)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control, repairs to
public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations;
   (e)   To maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing the
potential for creating blight areas; and
   (f)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available; and
   (g)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development.
(Ord. No. 07-23, § 1, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-202. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following definitions are adopted:
   Base flood: The flood having a one-percent probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood.
The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section
18-203 of this article.
   Base flood elevation (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   Building: A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and gas
or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and
travel trailers installed on a site for more than 180 days per year.
   Critical facility: Any public or private facility which, if flooded, would
create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life
and health. Examples are public buildings, emergency operations and
communication centers, health care facilities and nursing homes, schools, and
toxic waste treatment, handling or storage facilities.
   Development: Any manmade change to real estate including, but not
necessarily limited to:
   (i)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building,
   (ii)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
   (iii)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for
a manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days per year;
   (iv)   Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts
or similar projects;
   (v)   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls, or fences;
   (vi)   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving, or
other alterations of the ground surface;
   (vii)   Storage of materials including the placement of gas and liquid
storage tanks; and
   (viii)   Channel modifications or any other activity that might change the
direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
Development does not include routine maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar practices
that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
   FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Flood: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   Flood fringe: That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.
   Flood insurance rate map: A map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (SFHA) within a
community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or may not depict
floodways and show base flood elevations.
   Floodplain: Those lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are subject
to inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of Big Creek are generally
identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of the city prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 2, 2007. The floodplains
of those parts of unincorporated Clark County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city
are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for
Clark County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 2,
2007. Floodplain also includes those areas of known flooding as identified by
the community.
   Floodproofing: Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.
   Floodproofing certificate: A form published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that is used to certify that a building has been designed and
constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection
elevation.
   Flood protection elevation (FPE): The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
   Floodway: That portion of the floodplain required to store and convey the
base flood. The floodways for each of the floodplains of the city shall be
according to the best data available from federal, state, or other sources.
   IDNR/OWR: Illinois Department of Natural Resources/Office of Water
Resources.
   Manufactured home: A structure transportable in one or more sections, that
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
   NFIP: National Flood Insurance Program.
   Repetitive loss: Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25 percent
of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   Special flood hazard area (SFHA): See definition of "floodplain". Floodplain
and special flood hazard area are synonymous.
   Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination.
   Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started.
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic
Places.
   Travel trailer (or recreational vehicle): A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less in size;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

the floodplain map.
(Ord. No. 07-23, § 4, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-205. Development permit.
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the zoning officer. The zoning officer shall not issue
a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the requirements
of this article.
   (a)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;

officer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation.
Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to be higher
than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled after the
date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is not in the floodplain and
therefore not subject to the requirements of this article. Conversely, any
development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and
hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood insurance rate map
is subject to the provisions of this article. The zoning officer shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first flood insurance rate map identification.

liability.
   (d)   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
18-207 of this article requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair
or alteration of a site or building included on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places may be granted
using criteria more permissive than the requirements of subsection
18-211(a)(1)-(7).
(Ord. No. 07-23, § 11, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-212. Disclaimer of liability.
The degree of protection required by this article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This ordinance does not create liability on the part
of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this article or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. No. 07-23, § 12, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-213. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this article and other easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 07-23, § 13, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-214. Penalty.
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this article. Upon due investigation, the zoning officer may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this article exists. The
zoning officer shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (a)   If such owner fails after ten days' notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The city shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this article or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the ordinance;
      (2)   Any person who violates this article shall upon conviction thereof
be fined according to section
1-5 of the city's Code of Ordinances; and
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (b)   The zoning officer of the city shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

compliance statement. However, if the cable service provider supplies
incomplete information which requires independent verification by the
franchising authority or its consultant, then the cable service provider be
required to reimburse the franchising authority for all costs associated with
the independent verification.

Sec. 23-29. Same—Performance evaluations.
The council/franchising authority is authorized to design a performance
evaluation procedure which periodically monitors compliance of the franchised
cable service provider with the terms and conditions of both the franchise and
this article. Moreover, the council/franchising authority may periodically
review and examine whether a franchised cable service provider's financial,
technical, legal and character qualifications continue to meet required
operational, maintenance and performance levels in order to ensure the
uninterrupted provision of cable services. Such performance evaluations may be
conducted every three years during the franchise term and may be done as part
of any survey.
(Ord. No. 95-25, § 3.2, 12-27-95; Ord. No. 22-12 , § 1, 5-9-22)
Sec. 23-30. Same—Alternative user charge.
   (a)   This section is applicable to any licensed, but enfranchised cable
operator service provider, and to any cable who has had its franchise (or any
portion thereof) determined to be unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid.
   (b)   Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law, and as an
alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee, the council/franchising
authority may impose, extract and collect a charge from an effected cable
service provider for the use by such provider of the streets, rights-of-way,
easements and public ways of the city.
   (c)   The alternative user charge shall be based on the following
mathematical mode:
      (1)   Determine the present value of all streets, right-of-way, easements
and public ways of the city in which the cable service provider's cable system
are located;
      (2)   Take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the
city (as determined by the amount of property appraiser for the city), for the
years that the present term has been in effect;
      (3)   Take the average percentage increase for the past years and use it
to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining
term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);
      (4)   Add the present value to the dollar amount of property value
increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable
then use five years);
      (5)   Divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the
term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);
      (6)   Multiply that figure by five percent to arrive at the annual user
charge that is to be collected from the affected cable service provider.
For purposes of illustration only, the formula reads as follows:
Present value, + dollar amount of property increase for remaining term of the
franchise (based on average percentage increase of land appraisals for past
years of franchise term), divide the adjusted value by the remaining years on
the term of the franchise, multiply that figure by five percent = the annual
alternative user charge.
   (d)   The council/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user
charge, in order to receive fair compensation for the affected cable operator's
use of the streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by
imposing a flat percentage fee on such cable service provider's annual gross
revenues. However, an affected cable service provider may agree to an
alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenues, as
long as that charge does not exceed five percent of an affected cable service
provider's annual gross revenues.
   (e)   A franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on
the same cable service provider at the same time, for the same period.
   (f)   An affected cable service provider shall at no time be charged or
obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds five percent of such
provider's gross revenues for any particular reporting period. In the event
that the alternative user charge does exceed five percent of gross revenues,
then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not
greater than the five percent cap.
   (g)   An affected cable service provider shall file with the franchising
authority, within 45 days after the expiration of each of the cable service
provider's fiscal quarters, a detailed statement clearly showing the gross
revenues received by cable service provider during the preceding quarter and
certified by a certified public accountant or officer of cable service provider
attesting to the accuracy, completeness, and veracity of the revenue figures.
Revenue will be reported by service category, type and level showing
computations an using incremental billing rates for all sources, levels, tiers
and types of service and other revenue sources of all types.
   (h)   Payment of the quarterly portion of the alternative user charge shall
be rendered to the franchising authority at the time the financial statement is
filed.

Sec. 52-28. Definitions.
For the purpose of this Code, the following definitions shall apply, unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   Camper means a mobile living unit designed to be mounted upon and conveyed
by a vehicle. No camper unit shall be occupied in the city except as provided
in the zoning ordinance.
   Livable, habitable condition means the unit is currently fit for permanent
habitation by a person. It shall include, but is not limited to, having
workable and functionable doors and windows.
   Manufactured home means a dwelling unit designed and built in a factory,
which bears a federal label certifying that it was built in compliance with the
Federal Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Law (42 U.S.C.
5401 et. Seq.), and includes, but is not limited to, modular or prefabricated
homes created in sections then transported to the home site for construction
and installation. This does not include mobile homes or trailers, see
Chapter 53 — Mobile Homes.
   Modular homes are created in sections, and then transported to the home site
for construction and installation. These are typically installed and treated
like a regular house, for financing, appraisal and construction purposes, and
are usually the most expensive of the three. Although the sections of the house
are prefabricated, the sections, or modules, are put together at the
construction much like a typical home. Manufactured homes, once placed on a
permanent foundation, are considered the same as modular or site build homes
for appraisal purposes.

accommodate the permittee if the cost of such work is borne by the permittee.
The cost of moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the
permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the
facility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all
pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way
affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support,
sustain and protect them under, over, along or across such work. The permittee
shall secure approval of the method of support and protection from the owner of
the facility.
   (b)   In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should
be damaged during excavation work, and for this purpose, pipe coating or other
encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure, the
permittee shall promptly notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall
be repaired by the agency or person owning them, and the expense of such
repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this subsection
(b) that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities and
any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such facility damage and
such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The
only exception will be for such instances where damage is exclusively due to
the negligence of the owning utility. The city shall not be made a party to any

   (a)   The permittee under this article shall, at all times, and at the
permittee's own expense, preserve and protect from injury any adjoining
property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for
the purpose. Where, in the protection of such property, it is necessary to
enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective
measures, the permittee shall obtain consent from the owner of such private
property for such purposes, and if he cannot obtain such consent, the
superintendent may authorize the permittee to enter the private premises solely
for the purpose of making the property safe.
   (b)   The permittee under this article shall, at its own expense, shore up
and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be
damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for
all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure
to properly protect and carry out such work. Whenever it may be necessary for
the permittee to trench through any lawn area, such area shall be reseeded or
the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required in this article. All construction and maintenance work
shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and
debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before
such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or
shrubs which exist in parking street areas without first obtaining the consent

or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as not to
endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the superintendent shall have the
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
   (b)   All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the
superintendent. Whenever necessary in order to expedite the flow of traffic or
to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the
superintendent to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.

superintendent. From time to time as may be ordered by the superintendent, and,
in any event, immediately after the completion of such work, the permittee
shall, at the permittee's own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and
unused materials of any kind resulting from such work, and upon failure to do
so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the superintendent,
such work may be done by the superintendent and the cost thereof charged to the
permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under
the surety bond provided under the terms of this article.

on top and has a base of water bound macadam at least six inches thick, and
provided that a Portland cement concrete apron not less than three feet in
width be constructed between the existing concrete pavement and the proposed
bituminous driveway surface.
      (3)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across the
sidewalk space, it shall conform to the sidewalk grade as established by the
superintendent of public works.
      (4)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across an
existing sidewalk, said sidewalk shall be removed and replaced with Portland

sidewalk that it will not be necessary to change the established grade of
either and will not elevate or depress any portion of either. No part of said
driveway shall extend beyond the curb line in such a manner as to change the
grade of said gutter or obstruct the free flow of water in said gutter. Where
elevations or depressions are necessary in the parkway strip between the curb
and walk, said parkway shall be graded on both sides of the driveway to a
distance sufficient to create a gradual ascent or descent. At no time shall the
gradient exceed one foot vertical to ten feet horizontal.

extend not less than five feet beyond both edges of the driveway where it
crosses the ditch. For each additional foot depth of ditch add two feet to the
above figure, except that no culvert shall be less than 20 feet long and except
that where headwalls are constructed at the ends of the culvert the length
shall be as determined by the superintendent of public works.

cover shall be furnished and set by the water department, and the additional
cost thereof shall be paid by the contractor.

shall be removed and replaced with a manhole top with perforated lid. Said top
shall be set by the street department, and the additional cost thereof shall be
paid by the contractor.

Sec. 74-82. Relation to adjoining street system.
The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the
continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper
projection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as they may be
deemed necessary for public requirements. The street and alley arrangements
shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access to it. Offset streets
shall be avoided. The angle of intersection between minor streets and major
streets shall not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. Streets

the remainder of the street shall be dedicated. Where a subdivision borders an
existing narrow road or when the comprehensive plan indicates plans for
realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of the land in
the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate those area for
widening or alignment of those roads. The costs of improving the realignment or
widening of the road may be shared between the city and the developer upon
determination by the council that the costs of the realignment or widening
exceed the cost of providing necessary access to the subdivision. Land reserved
for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area
requirements of the zoning ordinance.
   (c)   Alleys may be provided in a residential block and, where provided,
shall have a dedicated right-of-way width of at least the footage as shown on

Sec. 78-123. Rate; exemption.
   (a)   A tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of renting,
leasing or letting rooms in a hotel at the rate of five percent of the gross
rental receipts for such renting, leasing or letting, excluding, however, from
gross rental receipts, the proceeds of such renting, leasing or letting to
permanent residents of that hotel, and excluding therefrom any amount collected
pursuant to the Hotel Operator's Occupation Tax Act (35 ILCS 145/1 et. seq.).
   (b)   Persons subject to the tax imposed by this article may reimburse
themselves for their tax liability under this article by separately stating
such tax as an additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, in

Occupation Tax Act.
   (c)   If any hotel operator collects an amount (however designated) which
purports to reimburse such operator for hotel operators' occupation tax
liability measured by receipts which are not subject to hotel operators'
occupation tax, or if any hotel operator, in collecting an amount (however
designated) which purports to reimburse such operator for hotel operators'
occupation tax liability measured by receipts which are subject to tax under
this Act, collects more from the customer than the operators' hotel operators'
occupation tax liability in the transaction is, the customer shall have a legal
right to claim a refund of such amount from such operator. However, if such
amount is not refunded to the customer for any reason, the hotel operator is
liable to pay such amount to the department.
(Ord. No. 93-12, § 3, 6-14-93)
Sec. 78-124. Books and records.
Every operator shall keep separate books or records of his or her business as

month shall file a return with the department stating:
      (1)   The name of the operator;

from which the operator engages in the business of renting, leasing or letting
rooms in a hotel in the city;
      (3)   Total amount of rental receipts received by the operator during the

      (7)   The amount of tax due;
      (8)   The amount of penalty due, if any;
      (9)   Such other reasonable information as the department may require.
   (b)   If the operator's average monthly tax liability to the department does
not exceed $50.00, the department may authorize the operator's returns to be
filed on a quarter annual basis, with the return for January, February and
March of a given year being due by April 30 of such year, with the return for
April, May and June of a given year being due by July 31 of such year; with the
return for July, August and September of a given year being due by October 31

   (c)   If the operator's average monthly tax liability to the department does
not exceed $10.00, the department may authorize the operator's returns to be
filed on an annual basis with the return for a given year being due by January
31 of the following year.
   (d)   Such quarter annual and annual returns, as to form and substance,
shall be subject to the same requirements as monthly returns.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision in this article concerning the
time within which an operator may file his or her return, in the case of any
operator who ceases to engage in a kind of business which makes the operator
responsible for filing returns under this article, such operator shall file a
final return under this article with the department not more than one month
after discontinuing such business.
   (f)   Where the same person has more than one business registered with the
department under separate registrations under this article, such person shall
not file each return that is due as a single return covering all such
registered businesses, but shall file separate returns for each such registered
business.
   (g)   In his or her return, the operator shall determine the value of any
consideration other than money received by the operator in connection with the
renting, leasing or letting of rooms in the course of the operator's business
and the operator shall include such value in the operator's return and shall
describe it in detail. Such determination shall be subject to review and
revision by the department in the manner hereinafter provided for the
correction of returns.
   (h)   Each return filed by an operator shall be signed by the president,
vice-president, secretary or treasurer or an corporation, by an active partner
of a partnership, by an individual operator or by the properly accredited agent
of any operator.
   (i)   The person filing the return herein provided for shall, at the time of
filing such return, pay to the department the amount of tax herein imposed. If
a return is not filed when and as required or if a tax payment is not made as
required or if a return is not filed until after the city issues a notice of
tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, the taxpayer shall be liable for
the interest, late filing penalty, late payment penalty, and failure to file
penalty, all as provided in section 11 of the city's Locally Imposed and
Administered Tax Rights and Responsibility Ordinance [section
78-170 of this chapter], until such return is filed and payment is made as
required. The treasurer shall be authorized to compromise or waive part or all
of the interest and penalty requirements pursuant to section 12 of the City's
Locally Imposed and Administered Tax Rights and Responsibility Ordinance
[section
78-171 of this chapter].
   (j)   The department may, upon separate written notice to a taxpayer,
require the taxpayer to prepare and file with the department on a form
prescribed by the department within not less than 30 days after receipt of the
notice an annual information return for the tax year specified in the notice.
Such annual return to the department shall include a statement of gross
receipts as shown by the operator's last state income tax return and any other
reasonable information as the department may require. If the total receipts of
the business as reported in the state income tax return do not agree with the
gross receipts reported to the department for the same period, the operator
shall attach to the annual information return a schedule showing a
reconciliation of the two amounts and the reasons for the difference. The
operator's annual information return to the department shall also disclose pay
roll information of the operator's business during the year covered by such
return and any additional reasonable information which the department deems
would be helpful in determining the accuracy of the monthly, quarterly or
annual tax returns by such operator as hereinbefore provided for in this
section.
   (k)   If the annual information return required by this section is not filed
when and as required, the taxpayer shall be liable for a late filing penalty as
provided in section 11(b) of the city's Locally Imposed and Administered Tax
Rights and Responsibility Ordinance [section
78-170(b) of this chapter] based on the tax which became due from such taxpayer
under this article during the period to be covered by the annual return until
such return is filed as required and the penalty paid. The authority of the
treasurer to waive part or all of the previously stated penalty is also
applicable to this penalty.
   (l)   The chief executive officer, proprietor, owner or highest ranking
manager shall sign the annual return to certify the accuracy of the information
contained therein. Any person who wilfully signs the annual return containing
false or inaccurate information shall be guilty of perjury and punished
accordingly. The annual return form prescribed by the department shall include
a warning that the person signing the return may be liable for perjury.
   (m)   The foregoing portion of this section concerning the filing of an
annual information return shall not apply to an operator who is not required to
file an income tax return with the United States Government.

   (a)   Any person engaged in the business of renting, leasing or letting
hotel rooms in the city who fails to make a return, or to keep books and
records as required herein, or who makes a fraudulent return, or willfully
violates any rule or regulation of the department for the administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this article, or any officer or agent of a

operators' occupation tax liability measured by receipts which such operator
knows are not subject to hotel operators' occupation tax, or any hotel operator
who over-collects or attempts to over-collect an amount purporting to reimburse
such operator for hotel operators' occupation tax liability in a transaction
which is subject to the tax that is imposed by this article shall, upon
conviction therefor, be fined according to the provisions of section 1-5 of
this Code for each offense.

Sec. 78-129. Delinquent taxes—Liens.
In the event any hotel operators' occupation tax, including interest and

charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent, and
thereafter such delinquent taxes and all subsequent taxes, including penalties,
incurred while the delinquent charges remain unpaid and all costs of filing and
lien notice(s) and of releasing any lien(s) shall constitute a lien upon the
real estate to which such taxes relate. The treasurer or the treasurer's
authorized representative is hereby authorized to file sworn statements showing
such delinquencies and subsequent taxes, including penalties, in the office of
the recorder of deeds of the county. These statements shall contain the legal
description of the involved premises, the amount of the unpaid taxes and
penalties and a notice that the city claims a lien for the total amount. The
filing of such statements shall be deemed lien notices for the payment of such
taxes and penalties.
(Ord. No. 93-12, § 9, 6-14-93; Ord. No. 99-25, § 1, 12-13-99; Ord. No. 00-15, §
3, 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-130. Foreclosure of lien and other judicial action.
   (a)   Any and all lien(s) for hotel operators' occupation tax(es)
established by law against the premises to which they relate may be enforced
and foreclosed by and on behalf of the city at any time in the appropriate
circuit court of the county according to the rules and practices of such court.
Such lien(s) also may be enforced and foreclosed by intervention at any time in
any suit already commenced in such court or any other court when such
intervention is proper under the law. Whenever the city is made a defendant in
any suit in any court, it shall have full power to enforce such liens(s) in
such proceedings at any time in any manner permitted by law. The party or
parties responsible for such taxes and penalties may also be sued for the
amount thereof as debt(s) owed to the city. The city attorney is hereby
authorized to take any judicial action referred to herein on behalf of the city
or to authorize any other person to do so.
   (b)   The cost of the enforcement and foreclosure of the lien or the cost of
the enforcement against the party or parties responsible for such taxes and
penalties incurred by the city, including court costs, attorneys fees and other
costs related to the enforcement are recoverable from the owner or owners of
the real estate, or the previous owner or both if the property was transferred
during the lien period, or the party or parties responsible for such taxes and
penalties.
   (c)   No method(s) herein provided for collecting such taxes shall be
considered as excluding any other method of collecting such taxes but shall be
concurrent with all other remedies and methods.
(Ord. No. 93-12, § 10, 6-14-93; Ord. No. 99-25, § 2, 12-13-99)
Sec. 78-131. Personal liability penalty.
   (a)   Any officer or employee of any taxpayer subject to the provisions of
this article who has the control, supervision or responsibility of filing
returns and making payment of the amount of any trust tax imposed in accordance
with this article and who wilfully fails to file the return or make the payment
to the department or wilfully attempts in any other manner to evade or defeat
the tax shall be personally liable for a penalty equal to the total amount of
the tax unpaid by the taxpayer including interest and penalties thereon. The
department shall determine a penalty due under this section according to its
best judgment and information, and that determination shall be prima facie
correct and shall be prima facie evidence of a penalty due under this section.
   (b)   The department shall issue a notice of penalty liability for the
amount claimed by the department pursuant to this section.
   (c)   The personal liability imposed by this section shall survive the
dissolution of a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation.
Interest shall continue to accrue on that portion of the penalty imposed by
this section which represents the tax unpaid by the taxpayer at the same rate
and in the same amount as interest accrues on the tax unpaid by the taxpayer.
   (d)   For the purposes of this section, "officer or employee of any
taxpayer" includes a partner of a partnership, a manager or member of a limited
liability corporation, and a member of a registered limited liability
partnership.
   (e)   A trust tax is any tax for which an amount is collected or withheld by
a taxpayer from another person, and any tax for which an amount is required to
be collected or withheld by a taxpayer from another person, regardless of
whether it is in fact collected or withheld.

liability incurred by a partner of a partnership or limited liability
partnership resulting from the tax liability to the partnership or limited
liability of partnership otherwise incurred pursuant to this article.

provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed
under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent
that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries
or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service;
      (7)   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related
to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under

   (g)   Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of
telecommunications through a sale at retail.
   (h)   Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.
   (i)   Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, or any like
term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or
other representative operating within this state under the authority of the

maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as
defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-
ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a
taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by
telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are
sent.
   (l)   Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents,
employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or
receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability
as authorized by this article.

popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any

satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means
a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.
(Ord. No. 02-13, § 3, 8-14-02; Ord. No. 04-19, § 4, 7-29-04)
Sec. 78-151. Simplified municipal telecommunications tax imposed.
A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:
   (a)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of one
percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer.
   (b)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of one
percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.
   (c)   The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.
(Ord. No. 02-13, § 3, 8-14-02)
Sec. 78-152. Collection of tax by retailers.
   (a)   The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
   (b)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross

information as required by the department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any

department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (b)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (c)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

any monies of the city.
      (2)   Within ten days of the receipt by the local tax administrator of
any claim for a refund or credit, the local tax administrator shall either:

   (c)   The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit
conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven days nor more than
30 days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer and local tax
administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the event taxpayer is
unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the taxpayer may
request another date within the 30 days, approved in writing, that is
convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.
   (d)   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's
business or activities, including original source documents and books of entry
denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any
tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English
language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the city.
   (e)   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available
its books and records for inspection by the city. If the taxpayer fails to
provide the documents necessary for audit within the time provided, the local
tax administrator may issue a tax determination and assessment based on the tax
administrator's determination of the best estimate of the taxpayer's tax
liability.
   (f)   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally
imposed and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the
amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within 30 days of the

      (2)   The amount of the tax liability proposed;
      (3)   The procedure for appealing the assessment; and

collection process.
   (b)   A taxpayer who receives written notice from the local tax
administrator of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the
local tax administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting
forth the basis of the taxpayers' request for a hearing. The written protest
and petition for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within
45 days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.
   (c)   If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed, the
local tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within 14 days of receipt of the written protest and petition for hearing,
unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
   (d)   If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within the
45 day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall become a final
bill due and owing without further notice.
   (e)   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than 90 days after the expiration of the 45 day period.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(9), 12-27-00)

for hearing under section nine, above, the local tax administrator shall
conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.

is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of
preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted
shall not exceed 14 days.
   (c)   At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and shall
hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings
shall not apply.
   (d)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the local tax administrator shall
make a written determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the
hearing. The taxpayer shall be provided with a copy of the written decision.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(10), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-170. Interest and penalties.
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   (a)   Interest. The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be nine
percent per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.
   (b)   Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of five percent of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a
return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent of the tax
due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided
by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25 percent of the total tax due for the applicable reporting
period for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment
penalty shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the
controlling ordinance.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(11), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-171. Abatement.
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(12), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-172. Installment contracts.
The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 20 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(13), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-173. Statute of limitations.
The city, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in
a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing.
The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the reviewed tax
returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due and owing.
   (a)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (b)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the city,
the tax paid was less than 75 percent of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (c)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(14), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-174. Voluntary disclosure.
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the
filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for
any period before the date of application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(15), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-175. Publication of tax ordinances.
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the city
clerk's office.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(16), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-176. Review of liens.
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (a)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (b)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (c)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1(17), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-177. Application.
This article shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict
with or inconsistent with this ordinance, this article shall be controlling.

(Code 1976, § 12-16.1)
Sec. 86-19. Equalized payment plan.
   (a)   Availability. Any customer that is not a large power purpose
electrical customer (as defined in section
86-56(4)) may elect to pay a monthly payment equal to 1/12of the average cost
of energy services for the previous 12 months, adjusted for current or
anticipated fuel costs and rates. The customer may be placed on the equalized
payment plan during any month of the year. The account is balanced with each
May billing or when service is disconnected or the customer is removed from the
equalized payment plan. The city reserves the right to cancel the customer's
participation in the plan should the customer fail to pay the equalized payment
by the due date of the monthly bill. The customer may cancel the agreement to
participate in this plan by giving 30 days' written notice to the city and by
agreeing to any necessary billing to make the account current.
   (b)   Payment determination. Accumulate the number of months and meter
billings to determine the average cost per month per meter on account. Total
the average cost per meter per month for the account. Adjust the average cost
per month to reflect current or anticipated fuel costs and rates. Round upward
to the nearest whole dollar to determine the monthly equalized payment plan.
      (1)   Accumulation of number of months must be equal to at least ten days
for the system to calculate payments. Previous customer's billing for the same
location may be used.
      (2)   Meter billings include electrical, gas, water and sewer service,
state utility tax, fuel adjustment and security lights.
      (3)   Any customer commencing the equalized payment plan during any month
other than May must pay, before commencing participation in the plan, the
amount by which the total equalized payment plan payments from the prior May to
date (assuming participation) exceeds the total payments actually made during
such period. If more has been paid than the equalized payment plan payments
would have required, the difference shall be credited to the customer's next
billings until fully applied.
   (c)   Adjustments. Equalized payment plan accounts will be mechanically
reviewed and adjusted every 12 months on the anniversary date. The May billing
shall be considered the anniversary date. A new equalized payment plan amount
will be calculated using the last 12 months' history. From the sixth through
the tenth months subsequent to the anniversary date, an audit may be
mechanically processed. Any account which has a debit balance greater than
twice the equalized payment plan payment will be placed on this audit report.
This report will include the following: name, account number, current equalized
payment plan payment amount and status. Payments may be adjusted based upon
review. Any debit balance for the last 12 months' listings will be billed with
the May billing. Any credit balance will be, at the customer's election,
credited toward the customer's next billings.
   (d)   General. Except for the equalizing of the customer's payments for
service, all other provisions, terms and conditions of the applicable rate
schedule shall continue to be applicable. Where a customer is using more than
one public utility service not at a specified location, the equalized payment
plan must be utilized for all services collectively. The city reserves the
right to designate a budget period other than the normal budget period for
application to customers whose service is seasonal in character. A method of
payment determination applicable to the designated budget period would be
applied.

from such user to be applied on a utility bill, which check is returned unpaid
by the bank upon which it is drawn. Such charge shall be collected from the
user in the same manner as collection is made of charges for utility services.

shall be applied first in payment of the service charge; second, in payment of
any penalty assessed by reason of late payment; and finally, to charges for
utility services.

unpaid by the bank upon which such checks are drawn within a 12-month period
must make all subsequent payments by cash, certified funds or money order.

service member, the city shall offer the residential consumer a period equal to
at least the period of the residential consumer's deployment on active duty to
pay any arrearages incurred during the period of the residential consumer's
deployment. The city shall inform the residential consumer that, if the period
the city offers presents a hardship to the consumer, the consumer may request a
longer period to pay the arrearages.
      (4)   In order to be eligible for the benefits granted to service members
under this section, a service member must provide the city with a copy of the
military or gubernatorial orders calling the service member to active duty and

the city only upon the condition that the charges or rates shall become a lien
upon the premises when the charges or rates become delinquent.
      (2)   A lien is created only if the city collector sends to the owner or
owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's
identification number, (i) a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person
who is delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notice sufficient to

civil action, the foregoing provisions in this section with respect to filing

         Three-phase, four-wire WYE, 120/208 volt service
         Three-phase, four-wire WYE, 277/480 volt service
      c.   Customers and potential customers whose installations may require
service voltages other than those normally available, as described in paragraph
b above, are requested to consult the superintendent to determine the
conditions under which such a type of service can be provided by the city.
      d.   The voltage and characteristics of the city electric lines supplying
a customer's load shall be determined by the city on the basis of the size and
characteristics of the customer's load and its relation to the city's primary
or secondary service facilities located in or proposed for the area in which
the customer is to be served or is presently being served.
   (4)   All installation of electrical wires, apparatus and necessaries shall
be inspected by the superintendent, and shall be performed under the
superintendent's supervision, and after its completion the same shall also be
inspected by the superintendent. Any obstruction which may interfere with and
prevent a perfect inspection of wires carrying electrical current, such as
lath, plaster, boards and partitions, must be removed upon order of the
superintendent.
   (5)   The director of public works and superintendent shall have full
management of the electric system and the inspection of all electrical work
within the city, inside of buildings and above, underneath and upon the surface
of streets and other real estate, in all electrical matters in which the city
is interested.
   (6)   All electrical wiring and installation of any house, building, office
or dwelling or other place within the city shall be under the direction of the
superintendent, in full and faithful accord and compliance with the latest
rules concerning the same adopted by National Electrical Code, the National
Electrical Safety Code and the American Insurance Association.
   (7)   No person but the superintendent shall attach to or make any
connections with any electrical wire with the purpose of procuring electrical
current therefrom. Any person so attaching and connecting to any such wire for
such purposes, without order from the superintendent and compliance with the
rules of this article, shall be prosecuted for theft.
   (8)   No claim for damages shall be made against the city by reason of the
breakage of any transformer, reducer, meter or wire carrying current; nor shall
the city be liable in damages to any customer deprived of electrical current by
reason of any breakage or any machinery or a stoppage for improvement or
repair; nor shall the city be liable for any loss, injury or damage resulting
from the interruption, restoration or reduction of electrical service from any
cause.
   (9)   The superintendent shall have power to cut off and deprive a customer
of electric current when the superintendent is satisfied that the building and
place is not properly wired, or wired according to the rules, or for violation
of any of the rules hereby adopted, or for nonpayment of any rate, rental or
other charge, and shall not again attach such customer until all rules violated
have been fully complied with and all sums due for electric current and other
charges and demands due the city are fully paid. Disconnection for nonpayment
shall be pursuant to section
86-24.
   (10)   The superintendent shall have full power to trim any shade tree or
bush, remove any obstruction within the streets, alleys and public places of
the city which hinder or obstruct the wires or the free and efficient delivery
of the electric current to the several parts of the city.
   (11)   The superintendent shall also have the right to order the removal of
any pole or post of any telegraph or telephone line which in any way impedes
the efficiency of the lines conveying electric current and power, and shall
take all other precautions necessary to prevent the electric current coming in
contact with wires of the lines other than the electric system, so that no harm
may occur to any person.
   (12)   The standard service voltage for all locations is 120/240 volts
single-phase, three-wire. Any other service voltage or three-phase service is
considered nonstandard.
   (13)   Nonstandard service voltage; excess facilities.
      a.   There may exist locations where an existing distribution network has
other than standard secondary service voltage. Some of these nonstandard
voltages are 240 volts, three-phase, three-wire; 120/240 volts, three-phase,
four-wire; and 480 volts, three-phase, three-wire. These systems are not being
expanded, but in certain cases a new service may be installed at the existing
voltages in the existing network.
      b.   If a nonstandard service voltage or three-phase service is desired,
the owner shall consult with the superintendent before purchasing heavy duty
residential, commercial or industrial equipment for installation on the
electric system. If it is practical in the opinion of the superintendent, the
nonstandard service voltage may be provided; however, the owner shall bear the
additional expense, at the discretion of the city, of special distribution
transformers, and the risk of extended loss of service in the event of a
transformer failure.
      c.   Should an existing customer wish to upgrade his or her electric
service beyond the standard service installation which is supplied by the city,
or should it be necessary to upgrade service to a customer because of increased
load or because customer's load is interfering with service to other city
customers, such necessary additional facilities shall be regarded as "excess
facilities."
      d.   The customer shall be responsible for the costs of all facilities
installed on the customer's premises and for the city's out-of-pocket costs, as
required, to provide any facilities beyond the standard service facilities
normally provided by the city.
   (14)   The following types of customer service taps are provided by the city
electric system:
      a.   Overhead tap-Overhead service area. Overhead service shall be

addition without the installation, by the customer, of a suitable duct through
which the customer may pull service conductors, provided by the city. See
subsection (17)g.
         17.   The allowable total length of an overhead service drop beyond
what is considered standard will be determined by the city on the basis of the
conductor size required and on the characteristics of the pole from which the
service conductors originate. In no case will the length of the service drop
exceed 150 feet.
         18.   If an overhead service connection is longer than the allowable
length of a service drop and requires intermediate supports, the service drop
shall be considered the portion between the city's distribution facilities and
the first point of attachment on the customer's property. The remainder of the
service connection, including the first support on private property, shall be
furnished, installed, owned, and maintained by the city at the customer's
expense.
      g.   Overhead service attachment requirements:
         1.   A service attachment may consist of insulating knobs, eyebolts,
or other city approved devices depending on the requirements.
            i.   In the event that the city must reattach or replace a service
attachment for the purposes of emergency service restoration, the customer may
be held responsible for any costs incurred by the city to reattach or replace
the service attachment. In no event shall the city be held liable for any
direct or consequential damage that may result from the city's efforts to
restore service.

height of six feet and a minimum height of four feet when measured from
finished floor or final grade to the centerline of the meter socket in such a
manner as to be plumb and to ensure a permanent attachment to a rigid
vibration-free wall or structure.
         10.   Metered load conductors shall not pass through adjacent meter
connection devices unless such conductors are an integral part of an approved
pre-wired multiple-position meter socket assembly.
         11.   If meter connection devices are installed in locations not
adjacent to the service entrance, the unmetered feeder conductors shall be
installed with a continuous run (i.e. no junction boxes or LBS permitted) of
rigid conduit and cable.
         12.   If the meter connection device for an instrument transformer
installation is not adjacent to the instrument transformer cabinet, the
customer shall provide a continuous (i.e. no junction boxes or LBS permitted)
rigid conduit and color coded conductor harness (not to exceed 50 feet in
length) extending between the instrument transformer cabinet and the meter
connection device. The conduit and conductor harness, installed by the
customer, shall be subject to the approval of the city. The city will make the
final terminations at the potential and current transformers and at the meter
connection device.
         13.   For instrument transformer installations, the city shall furnish
and install all metering transformers at its expense.
         14.   The potential leads for any instrument transformer installation
shall be connected to the line side of the current transformer leads.
      d.   Testing. Any municipal electric meter shall be taken out of service
and tested upon complaint by the customer, upon payment of a fee of $10.00. If
upon test the meter is not within three percent of being accurate, it shall be
repaired or replaced and the $10.00 fee returned to the customer. If the meter
is within three percent of being correct, the fee will not be refunded and the
meter may be placed back in service.
      e.   Meters stopped or registering inaccurately. Customer billing will be
based on estimated usage when meters are found stopped or registering
improperly. Such estimates will be based on comparable months' billings or
previous years' billings amended to the current rates and conditions when such
information is available.
   (16)   The following rules of service shall apply:
      a.   The superintendent shall deny or discontinue service to a customer
when in his or her opinion the wiring and equipment is unsafe, causes
unacceptable interference with the service of other customers or has
objectionable conditions. However, the city will cooperate with the customer in
order to determine the necessary remedial action for such conditions.
      b.   The city reserves the right to inspect and test any equipment
connected to its system and to require that such equipment be provided with
nameplates showing the voltage, phase, full-load current, maximum current,
maximum kilo-volt amperes, and such other information as may be necessary to
determine the operating characteristics of the equipment.
      c.   All of a customer's lighting equipment, motor-driven equipment,
apparatus, and appliances shall have such characteristics or be equipped with
corrective devices so as to enable the city to maintain a satisfactory standard
of electric service. In the case of high motor starting current, violently
fluctuating or intermittent loads and the like, the city reserves and shall
have the right to require the customer to install, at the customer's expense,
transformers and apparatus to correct the objectionable conditions. These cases
may include welders, hoists, elevator motors, pumps, and similar apparatus.
      d.   When a separate or oversized substation or transformer must be
installed specifically to eliminate the effect of the objectionable load
condition, and the distribution system would otherwise have the capacity and
equipment required to supply a normal load service of the same size, or where
separate transformers and/or service are installed at the customer's request,
the substation or transformers are considered a corrective device under
subparagraph a. of this paragraph, and shall be provided at the customer's
expense, at the discretion of the city.
      e.   The city electrical rates for general service customers are based on
all such customers maintaining a power factor of not less than 85 percent
lagging. If a customer's power factor is less than 85 percent during periods of
normal operation, the city reserves the right to require the customer to
install, at his or her own expense, such corrective equipment as may be
required to increase such customer's power factor to not less than 85 percent
lagging.
      f.   When a customer fails to install the necessary facilities on his or
her premises to correct the objectionable conditions of his or her load, or
fails to prevent such objectionable conditions from interfering with the city's
supply of satisfactory service to other customers, the city shall have the
right to deny service to the customer until the objectionable conditions shall
have been corrected in a manner satisfactory to the city.
      g.   Where corrective equipment is installed by the city on its
distribution system to correct any objectionable conditions, the customer whose
service caused the objectionable conditions shall be required to pay, at the
discretion of the city, without refund, the installed cost of such corrective
equipment, and the corrective equipment shall remain the property of the city.
In lieu of such payment, and subject to approval by the city, a customer may
elect to pay a monthly charge equal to 1.5 percent of the installed cost of
such corrective equipment installed by the city.
   (17)   Changes to existing electric service facilities.
      a.   Should it become necessary, strictly in the interest of the city, to
change the voltage or characteristics (i.e. change from overhead to underground
type) of lines entering the property of an existing customer, the city shall
bear the costs associated with modifying or replacing the city's existing
facilities, as necessary, to provide the same level and type of electric
service as was available prior to the date of the required change.
      b.   Any changes which are required to the electric service entrance
facilities of the customer to accommodate the revised or upgraded city electric
service facilities will be made by the customer at no cost to the city.
      c.   The city shall retain sole responsibility for deciding to change the
voltage or the characteristics of the lines entering the property of an
existing customer for any reason which is determined, by the city, to be in the
best interest of the city and its customers.
      d.   If, because of public improvements such as street widening, grading,
excavating or other reasons beyond the city's control, the city must move
facilities with which it serves the customer, the city, as a condition of
continued service, may require that a new service connection be established
under the same terms as an original service connection from the standpoint of
city and customer's expense and installation.
      e.   If the city determines that a change in the voltage or
characteristics of the lines entering an existing customer's facility are
necessary, the city will:
         1.   Notify the customer of this fact in writing;
         2.   Furnish an estimate of the charges which will be incurred by the
customer due to the necessary improvement. The cost estimate will be prepared
based on information which is available to the city at the time and will be
based upon the most economical service plan consistent with good engineering
and operating practice, as determined by the city, and in accordance with all
applicable codes and regulations.
      f.   As a condition for continuing to receive electric service from the
city, the customer must advance the estimated cost of the required improvement
by the city. The customer must also make all of the necessary arrangements and
fund any improvements which are required on the customer's service entrance
equipment.
      g.   Should a customer desire to install a deck, porch, walk or any other
building addition above an existing underground service connection, the
customer shall choose to follow one of the following two options:
         1.   The customer may apply for an upgraded service connection to be
installed at the present location but which will include a duct installation as
described under subsection (14)f.16. above.
         2.   The customer may apply for an upgraded service connection to be
installed in a different location not affected by the proposed building
addition.
      h.   Should a customer desire to install a pool or other structure
beneath an existing overhead service connection, the customer shall apply for
an upgraded service location which will not be affected by the proposed
additions.
      i.   For customers requiring modifications to their existing overhead or
underground electric service entrance facilities as per subparagraphs g or h
above, the customer shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for all out-
of-pocket costs that are incurred by the city in making any required
modifications to the customer's existing service entrance facilities.
   (18)   Resale.
      a.   Electrical energy provided by the electric system shall not be sold
to a third party or otherwise disposed of by a third party. The energy provided
by the electric system shall be for the sole use of its customers.
      b.   When a customer elects to upgrade the existing electrical facilities
in an existing multiple occupancy premise, the installation of the upgraded
facilities shall have to conform to the requirement established by this
paragraph as well as this article.
   (19)   Motors and electrical apparatus used by customers on the electric
system shall comply with the following:
      a.   The city reserves the right to select the type of service to be
supplied, and shall be consulted before the equipment is purchased or ordered
by a customer, regarding the general characteristics of service, including
those services having five hp and larger or where the aggregate load of smaller
motors is more than seven and one-half horsepower (hp).
      b.   In general, seven and one-half hp and larger motors will be three-
phase, and motors smaller than seven and one-half hp may be single-phase. There
may be, at the city's sole discretion, exceptions to this rule, as follows:
         1.   In outlying and residential areas where three-phase energy is not
readily available, larger single-phase motors may be permitted, but only with
prior approval of the superintendent.
         2.   Where the customer is already using three-phase energy, motors
smaller than seven and one-half hp may be added to the three-phase service,
upon notification to the city.
         3.   Three-phase service is not normally available for residential
customers and is considered nonstandard service.
      c.   Motor and motorized equipment will generally be approved for use on
the electric system only if the total locked rotor current does not exceed an
acceptable level, as determined by the superintendent.
      d.   Whenever, in the judgment of the city, a motor starting current is
of a magnitude to cause interference to other customers, the customer shall be
required to provide a starting device of a type which will eliminate such
interference.
      e.   Manually-operated reduced voltage starting devices shall be so
constructed that they cannot be placed in the running position before passing
through the starting position.
      f.   Application of reduced voltage starting and the application of
under-voltage release starting equipment are recommended for all motors seven
and one-half horsepower or larger. The under-voltage release shall be of a type
that will return the starting device to the off position when the electric
supply is interrupted.
   (20)   Rented private lighting luminaires (dusk-to-dawn lights or security
lights) for homes, schools, security, churches, commercial areas, and industry
shall be provided where feasible and in keeping with good electrical practice
upon request, as per the following specifications:
      a.   A self-contained automatic dusk-to-dawn 175-watt mercury vapor
lighting fixture shall be furnished and installed, or caused to be installed,
by the city, such fixture to meet standards and specifications of the city, on
existing wood pole structures. The city will be responsible for making the
installation, furnishing the electricity for the operation of the lamp,
providing all the necessary maintenance (including the replacement of lamps,
but excluding malicious damage) for the length of service, as agreed to by the
city.
      b.   Dusk-to-dawn lights shall be installed on wood poles with a normal
ground-to-lamp height of approximately 25 feet. Should a customer desire his or
her lighting on steel, aluminum, concrete, decorative-type poles and/or
underground cable installation, the city may, at its discretion, install or
cause the special service to be installed. The customer shall bear the total
cost that is above that of a normal wood pole installation, and the additional
charge shall be payable by the customer prior to installation.
      c.   The customer shall have the responsibility to notify the city of any
interruption of service of the dusk-to-dawn lights. The city will restore
service only during regularly scheduled working hours and shall, in any event,
be under no obligation to do so before 72 hours from the time of notification.
If the city is unable to effect repairs not caused by the customer within this
period, the city's only responsibility will be to abate the charges on a pro-
rata basis for each day after 72 hours in which service is not available. The
customer shall remove any obstruction to the installation of the city-owned
facilities.
   (21)   Extensions of electric service facilities.
      a.   If an extension of the city's system becomes necessary to service a
new development or a block of new customers under a common development, the
city shall furnish and install the necessary electrical distribution facilities
necessary to provide service to the new development or block of new customers.
         1.   The improvements necessary to provide electric service to a new
development or block of customers shall consist of "off-site" improvements and
"on-site" improvements.
         2.   "Off-site" improvements shall refer to extensions of the city's
basic transmission, substation, or distribution system necessary to provide for

serve city customer loads.
         6.   Should it become necessary and practical, due to unforeseen
future development, for the city to serve additional loads from distribution
lines initially paid for by a particular customer as per the procedure outlined
above, it shall be the prerogative of the city, as a condition for using these
facilities, to purchase these lines from the customer for a sum equal to the
remaining life cost of the distribution lines in question, as determined by the
city.
         7.   Any extension of the city's distribution system shall be owned,
maintained and operated by the city, with the exception of customer-owned
service stations or other customer-owned facilities.
      g.   If an extension of the city system is proposed in an area where
certain non-city owned electric improvements already exist, costs of the "on-
site" improvements may include a proportionate share of all expenses, prior to
connection, incurred by city, including the costs of purchasing the existing
"on-site" distribution systems, and any improvements deemed necessary for the
safe and efficient operation of the system, including the roadway lighting
system.
   (22)   Customer-owned facilities.

         c.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or
         d.   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing traces or sewer cages, under the provisions
of subsection (11).
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
      (6)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be so
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
      (7)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense.
      (8)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and,
when required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
      (9)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this division and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but no less than once per year. The
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and local standards
are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and
laboratory analyses to the city at such times and in such a manner as
prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements,
analyses, and reporting required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary
the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
outside laboratory service.
      (10)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of
Laboratories Manual of Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control
manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.
      (11)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with section
86-186, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance
with federal and state guidelines for user charge system.

DIVISION 3. WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
Sec. 86-186. Generally.
   (a)   Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge
for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the
city shall consist of a basic user charge, a debt service charge, a capital
improvement charge and applicable surcharges.
   (b)   The basic user charge is levied on all users to recover the operation,
maintenance and replacement (O, M & R) costs and shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic concentrations:
      A five-day, 20-degree Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 300 mg/
l; or
      A suspended solids content of 390 mg/l.
      The basic user charge shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the annual wastewater volume, pounds of BOD and pounds of
SS to be treated.
      (2)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
      (3)   Proportion the estimated O, M & R costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, BOD and SS.
      (4)   Proportion the estimated O, M & R costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, BOD and SS.
      (5)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal domestic strength
sewage.
      (6)   Compute surcharge costs per pound for BOD and SS concentrations in
excess of normal domestic strengths.
   (c)   The debt service charge is computed by apportioning the annual debt
service as a charge per 1,000 gallons.
   (d)   The capital improvement charge is levied on sewers to provide for
capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage treatment
works. The capital improvement charge is computed by apportioning the annual
amount to be accrued as a charge per 1,000 gallons.
   (e)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
domestic concentrations of 300 mg/l BOD and 390 mg/l SS. The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the 300 mg/l and 390 mg/l concentrations for BOD and SS,
respectively.
The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be established
by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as may be deemed
necessary by the superintendent and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.
   (f)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or O, M & R costs.
   (g)   The users of the wastewater treatment services will be notified
annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of
the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater operation,
maintenance and replacement.
   (h)   Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be the metered or spent water consumption read to
the lowest even increments of 100 gallons.
      (1)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of his water from sources other than the city's water system,
all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the
superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
these other sources.
      (2)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.
      (3)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the superintendent.
   (i)   Basic user charge: There shall be and there is hereby established a
basic user charge of $2.40 per 1,000 gallons per month of metered water
consumption to be applied to all users to recover O, M & R costs. Commencing
with the first billing date for each user after July 1 of each year, there
shall be a five percent increase to the basic user charge in effect prior to
the increase.
   (j)   Debt service charge. There shall be and there is hereby established a
debt service charge of $0.73 per 1,000 gallons per month, to each user of the
wastewater facility. All users outside the corporate limits of the city shall
have an additional $10.00 per month per meter charge added to their debt
service charge.
   (k)   Capital improvement charge. There shall be and there is hereby
established a capital improvement charge of $0.36 per 1,000 gallons per month
to each user of the wastewater facility.
   (l)   Rates. A minimum charge per month shall be applied to all users whose
water consumption does not exceed 2,000 gallons per month. This minimum charge
shall consist of two multiplied by the total of the basic user charge per 1,000
gallons per month plus the debt service charge per 1,000 gallons per month plus
the capital improvement charge per 1,000 gallons per month. The minimum charge
for multifamily dwellings or multi-user units, which are not connected and
metered separately, shall be the minimum charge per month as calculated in the
foregoing sentence times the number of dwellings or units connected to the
single line per month.
   (m)   All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater facilities shall
pay a flat rate charge of $12.40 per month. The flat rate charge consists of
$6.48 for O, M & R costs, $4.48 for debt service costs and $1.44 for capital
improvement costs. The flat rate charge will allow a maximum of 4,000 gallons
per month. In the event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by the
superintendent to be in excess of 4,000 gallons per month, the superintendent
may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the water supply
or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied.
   (n)   Surcharge rates. The rates of surcharges for BOD and SS shall be as
follows:
      Per pound of BOD$0.12
      Per pound of SS0.14
   (o)   Computation of wastewater service charge. The wastewater service
charge shall be computed by the following formula:
      CW = CC + CD = CM + (Vu-X) CU + CS
      Where CW = Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period.
      CC = Capital improvement charge (subparagraph (k)).
      CD = Debt service charge (subparagraph (j)).
      CM = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
(subparagraph (l)).
      Vu = Wastewater volume for the billing period.
      X = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge (subparagraph
(l)).
      CU = Basic user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
(subparagraph (i)).
      CS = Surcharges, if applicable (subparagraph (n)).

ARTICLE VI. IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
Sec. 86-210. Purpose.
The purpose of this identity theft prevention program is to protect customers
of the city's utility services from identity theft. The program is intended to
establish reasonable policies and procedures to facilitate the detection,
prevention and mitigation of identity theft in connection with the opening of
new covered accounts and activity on existing covered accounts. This identity
theft prevention program is adopted pursuant to and in compliance with the
Identity Theft Rules of the Federal Trade Commission, Part 681 of Title 16 of
the Code of Federal Regulations (16 CFR Part 681).
(Ord. No. 08-23, § 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, § 1, 1-23-12)
Sec. 86-211. Scope.
This program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying
information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the city
by any and all personnel of the city, including management personnel. This
program does not replace or repeal any previously existing policies or programs
addressing some or all of the activities that are the subject of this program,
but rather it is intended to supplement any such existing policies and
programs.
(Ord. No. 08-23, § 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, § 1, 1-23-12)
Sec. 86-212. Definitions.
When used in this program, the following terms have the meanings set forth
opposite their name, unless the context clearly requires that the term be given
a different meaning:
   Covered account: The term "covered account" means an account that the city
offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that
involves or is designed to permit multiple payments of transactions. (16 CFR
681.2(b)(3)(i)). A utility account is a "covered account." The term "covered
account" also includes other accounts offered or maintained by the city for

(Ord. No. 08-23, § 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, § 1, 1-23-12)
Sec. 86-214. Identity theft prevention elements.
   (a)   Identification of relevant red flags. The city has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the Federal
Trade Commission's Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the city's past
history with instances of identity theft, if any. The city hereby determines
that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this program
given the relative size of the city and the limited nature and scope of the
services that the city provides to its citizens:
      (1)   The presentation of suspicious documents.
         a.   Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered
or forged.
         b.   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
         c.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
         d.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the city, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
         e.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
      (2)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
         a.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the city. For example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report
or credit reporting agency ID check response; or
            2.   The social security number has not been issued, or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's death master file.
         b.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the Social
Security Number range and date of birth.
         c.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the city. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
            2.   The phone number on an application is the same as the number
provided on a fraudulent application.
         d.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the city. For example:
            1.   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         e.   The social security number provided is the same as that submitted
by other persons opening an account or other customers.
         f.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
         g.   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
         h.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the city.
         i.   If the city uses challenge questions, the person opening the
covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
      (3)   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
         a.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the city receives a request for the addition of authorized users on
the account.
         b.   A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known fraud patterns. For example: the customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
         c.   A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
         d.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
         e.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although usage of utility products or services continues in connection with the
customer's covered account.
         f.   The city is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
         g.   The city is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products or
services in connection with a customer's covered account.
      (4)   Notice of possible identity theft.
         a.   The city is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a
law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
      (5)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers (if such agencies or providers are used
by the city):
         a.   A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report
or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
         b.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in
response to a request for a consumer report.
         c.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in §681.1(b) of the Federal Trade Commission's Identity
Theft Rules.
         d.   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
            1.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            2.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
            3.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            4.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (b)   Detection of red flags.
      (1)   The employees of the city that interact directly with customers on
a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for monitoring the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and the
modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that all employees who might
be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such
that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in
this program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to
recognize the red flags identified in this program shall not open a new account
for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer
with access to information in an existing account without the direct
supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant
red flags identified in this program and exercise sound judgment in connection
with the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in
connection with the opening of a new account or with modifying or accessing of
an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for making the
final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
      (2)   The program administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally
consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program rules (31 CFR
103.121) implementing Section 326(a) of the USA Patriot Act but need not be as
detailed. The program administrator may, but is not required to, maintain a
relationship with a credit reporting agency to perform identity verification
services. The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written
policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
   (c)   Response to detected red flags.
      (1)   If the responsible employees of the city as set forth in the
previous subsection are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a
reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to
open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account based on
the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider, the city shall not open the new account or modify or
otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be.
Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or the modification or
access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the city and
shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
      (2)   The program administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security
incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a
notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent
individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity
theft when a red flag is detected include:
         a.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
         b.   Contacting the customer.
         c.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices
that permit access to a covered account.
         d.   Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
         e.   Not opening a new covered account.
         f.   Closing an existing covered account.
         g.   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a
covered account to a debt collector.
         h.   Notifying law enforcement.
         i.   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.

Sec. 86-215. Program management and accountability.
   (a)   Initial risk assessment—Covered accounts. Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the Federal Trade Commission's Identity
Theft Rules. Therefore, the city determines that with respect to its
residential utility accounts it offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The
city also performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility
offers or maintains any other accounts for which there are reasonably
foreseeable risks to customers or the utility from identity theft. In making
this determination the city considered (1) the methods it uses to open its
accounts, (2) the methods it uses to access its accounts, and (3) its previous
experience with identity theft, and it concluded that it does not offer or
maintain any such other covered accounts.
   (b)   Program updates—Risk assessment. The program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
program update include:
      (1)   An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
      (2)   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures.
      (3)   Changes in methods of identity theft.
      (4)   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
      (5)   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   (c)   Training and oversight.
      (1)   All staff and third-party service providers performing any activity
in connection with one or more covered accounts are to be provided appropriate
training and receive effective oversight to ensure that the activity is
conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed to detect,
prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.

The city should be aware of the following related legal requirements:
   (a)   31 U.S.C. 5318 (g)—Reporting of Suspicious Activities.
   (b)   15 U.S.C. 1681 c-1 (h)—Identity Theft Prevention; Fraud Alerts and
Active Duty Alerts - Limitations on Use of Information for Credit Extensions.
   (c)   15 U.S.C. 1681 s-2—Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to
Consumer Reporting Agencies.

and prior to the filing of such notice, and the lien of the city shall not be
valid as to any mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lienor whose rights in
and to such real estate arise prior to the filing of such notice. Upon payment
of the cost and expense by the owner of or persons interested in such property
after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the city or
person in whose name the lien has been filed and the release may be filed of
record as in the case of the filing of the notice of lien.

a notice is personally served on, or sent by certified mail to, the person to
whom was sent the tax bill for the general taxes on the property for the last
preceding year. The notice shall be delivered or sent after the cutting of
weeds on the property. The notice shall state the substance of Section 11-20-
7 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-20-7) and the substance of this
section and shall identify the property, by common description, and the
location of the weeds to be cut.

statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be in equity in the name of the city.
The city attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such
proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court having jurisdiction over
such matter, against any property for which such bill for weed cutting is

ARTICLE VI. BUSINESS DISTRICTS
Section 6.1. Purpose of the business districts.
The primary purpose of the business districts is that they be located to serve
commercial concerns efficiently and to minimize any negative impact on less
intense uses such as residences and agriculture. For this purpose, business
uses are allowed greater density. For business districts, more than one (1)
principal use may be allowed in a single building without zoning board of
appeals approval if the uses are permitted by the right in the district.
The B-1 neighborhood business district is intended to provide commercial areas
of limited size, for basic trade and personal services for the convenience of
adjacent residential areas, for needs recurring regularly or frequently.
The B-2 general shopping district is intended to provide areas for a range of
commercial uses wider than that of neighborhood business but at a lower
intensity than the regional shopping, meeting the general business needs of the
city.
The B-3 regional shopping district's primary purpose is to provide for retail,
service, office and commercial uses of regional importance. It is intended to
provide the zoning and capital improvements which attract a level of
development capable of generating a significant number of jobs. Establishments
in this district may range in size from free-standing one-user buildings to
regional shopping malls. Such businesses generate high levels of traffic and
consequently require a significant investment in public infrastructure.

Section 6.14. Downtown business district.
   The historical business district shall be an overlay district of the

and both sides of Locust Street from Fifth Street to Sixth Street. Additional

(Ord. No. 2024-O-24, § 1, 10-28-24)
Section 6.15. Downtown business district.
   The traditional commercial façade can be considered the most important
element that gives historical significance to the downtown. Most of the
buildings in the downtown business district were built between 1880 and 1910.
When originally constructed, downtown buildings shared a consistency in design
and proportion that was a key element in the unifying of the district. To
maintain this unifying element, new construction and rehabilitation of existing
buildings will follow the points below:
   (a)   Store fronts will provide an entrance to the business and have large
display windows. Storefronts (first floor) shall be composed almost entirely of
windows. Traditional façade calls for more glass and less wall space, balanced
with less window space and more masonry at the second and third floor levels.
   (b)   The façade will consist of masonry with regularly spaced windows.
   (c)   There will be a decorative cornice which caps the building.
   (d)   Materials not be applied to the storefront include imitation brick,
rough textured wood siding, wooden shingles on mansard roofs, gravel and/or
stucco materials.
   (e)   Canvas awnings are approved on traditional storefront buildings. At a
minimum, awnings should be seven feet above grade.
(Ord. No. 2024-O-24, § 1, 10-28-24)
Section 6.16. Downtown business district—Procedure for approval of new
construction and rehabilitation.
   Plans for new construction or rehabilitation of older buildings shall be
submitted to the zoning officer for approval.
(Ord. No. 2024-O-24, § 1, 10-28-24)
ARTICLE VII. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
Section 7.1. Purpose of industrial districts.
The primary purpose of the industrial districts is that they be located to
serve industrial concerns efficiently and to minimize any negative impact on
less intense uses such as some commercial and all residential uses. This
purpose includes protecting lands with suitable characteristics and
infrastructure for industrial development from residential encroachment. For
this purpose, industrial uses are allowed greater density. For industrial
districts, more than one (1) principal use may be allowed in a single building
without zoning board of appeals approval if the uses are permitted by right in
the districts. In addition, to satisfy the purpose residential uses are
prohibited in industrial districts. This does not apply to farm dwellings.

ARTICLE X. STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL USES
Section 10.1. Special uses.
A special use is one which is potentially appropriate in and compatible with
other uses in its zoning district, but which, because of the potential impact
on the district necessitates close examination, site plan review, and
individual regulation. Special uses are not permitted by right in the various
zoning districts; a valid special use permit, authorized by the city council in
accordance with the procedures stipulated herein, is required before
application for a building permit or for a certificate of occupancy for a
special use.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 10.2. Special use permit procedures.
   The standards and procedures for the consideration of mobile home parks are
specified in the city's
Chapter 53 - Mobile Homes Code. All other special uses designated in
Table One of this article are subject to the procedures and standards
stipulated herein.
The zoning officer shall not issue a special use permit unless and until the
following procedure has been completed: A written application for a special use
permit shall be submitted to the zoning officer by the owners of record of the
property involved. The application shall demonstrate:
      (1)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort, or general welfare.
      (2)   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
or substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (3)   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district.
      (4)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      (5)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide access
so designed as to minimize traffic congestions in the public street.
      (6)   That the establishment, maintenance and operation of the special
use will be in conformance with the purpose to the regulations of the district
in which the special use is to be located, except as such regulations may, in
each instance, be modified by the city council pursuant to the recommendations
of the zoning commission.
After an application for a permit has been made the zoning commission shall
hold a duly advertised public hearing as prescribed by statute and make a
recommendation to grant or deny the special use within sixty (60) days of
filing of the complete application. The notice of hearing shall contain the
address or location of the property for which the special use is requested as
well as the nature of the special use. A nonrefundable one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) fee shall be paid to partially defer the cost of the of the
public hearing involving the special use. The applicant shall pay the sum to
the city treasurer at the time of filing for the permit.
The zoning commission recommendation must be based on a finding of fact
determined from the evidence presented at the hearing. In making its
recommendation, the zoning commission may also recommend such additional
conditions and requirements as are appropriate or necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare and to carry out the purpose of this
ordinance. Recommendations including but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Regulate the location, extent, and intensity of such uses;
      (2)   Require adherence to an approved site plan;
      (3)   Require landscaping and the screening of such uses by means of
fences, walls, or vegetation;
      (4)   Stipulate required minimum lot sizes, minimum yards, and maximum
height of buildings and structures;
      (5)   Regulate vehicular access and volume, and the design and location
of parking and loading areas and structures;
      (6)   Require conformance to health, safety, and sanitation requirements,
as necessary;
      (7)   Regulate signs and outdoor lighting; and
      (8)   Any other conditions deemed necessary to effect the purposes of
this ordinance.
The city council shall, by ordinance, make the decision to grant or deny a
special use permit within sixty (60) days of receiving the zoning commission
recommendation. The city council may impose any conditions or requirements,
including but not limited to those recommended by the zoning commission, which
it deems appropriate or necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare and to carry out the purpose of this ordinance. In addition, any
proposed special use which fails to receive the positive approval of the zoning
commission shall not be approved by the city council except by a two-thirds (?)
vote of the city council members then holding office.
A special use authorized by a special use permit is subject to all the
development regulations applicable to permitted uses in the district in which
it is located, unless other regulations are specifically stated in the special
use permit. Special uses are also subject to applicable development regulations
specified in
Table One: Table of Additional Conditions for Specific Special Uses. 
Unless otherwise specifically provided in the terms of the special use permit,
the permit shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of its
issuance. A valid special use permit is required in order to apply for a
building permit, or for a certificate of occupancy if no building permits is
required to establish a use; once established, however, the special use may
continue indefinitely beyond the expiration of the permit allowing it, unless
otherwise specifically provided in the terms of the permit.
Violation of the terms and conditions of the special use permit shall be deemed
a violation of this ordinance. Extensions of any time period, or changes in the
development schedule or other time sequence which were approved as part of the
special use permit may be approved only by the city council; any such extension
or change which is not so authorized shall be deemed a violation of this
ordinance.

O-02, § 1, 1-9-23)
Section 10.3. Standards for specific special uses.
All special uses listed in Table One: Table of Additional Conditions for
Specific Special Uses shall comply with the development standards contained
therein, unless otherwise specially provided in the permit authorized specially
by the city council; such uses shall also comply with all applicable parking
regulations, and development regulations stated for the district and use in
question, unless otherwise provided for in the permit.

ARTICLE XI. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND EXCEPTIONS
The provisions of this ordinance shall be subject to such exceptions, additions
or modifications as herein provided by the following supplementary regulations.
Section 11.1. Height.
      (1)   Height exceptions. The height limitations of this article shall not
apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, penthouses and domes not used for
human occupancy; nor to chimneys, ventilators, skylights, water tanks,
bulkheads, similar features, and necessary mechanical appurtenances usually
carried above the roof level. Such features, however, shall be erected only to
such height as necessary to accomplish the purpose they serve.
      (2)   Ornamental features. The provisions of this article shall not apply
to prevent the erection above the building height limit of a parapet wall or
cornice for ornament (and without windows) extending above such height limit
not more than five (5) feet.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 11.2. Area.
      (1)   Reduced lot area. No lot shall be so reduced in area that any
required open space will be smaller than prescribed in the regulations for the
district in which said lot is located. Whenever such reduction in lot area
occurs, any building located on said lot shall not thereafter be used until
such building is altered, reconstructed, or relocated so as to comply with the
area and yard requirements applicable thereto.
      (2)   Visibility at intersections. On a corner in any residential
district no fence, wall, hedge, earth terraces, parking facilities or other
structure or plant which would obstruct motor vehicle visibility of traffic
approaching the corner or intersection shall be erected, placed or maintained
within the triangular area formed by the intersecting lot lines nearest the
street intersection, and a straight line adjoining said lot lines at points

      (1)   The off-street parking facilities required for the uses mentioned
in this ordinance, and for other similar uses, shall be on the same lot or
parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve, but in case of
nonresidential uses when practical difficulties prevent their establishment
upon the same lot, the required parking facilities shall be provided within
three hundred (300) feet of the premises to which they are appurtenant.
      (2)   In residential districts, parking in the front yard is prohibit
except for access drives which clearly serve one-family and two-family dwelling
units. Such spaces may be stacked.
      (3)   No part of an off-street parking area required for any building or
use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be
included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another
building or use unless the type of structure indicates that the periods of
usage of such structures will not be simultaneous with each other.
      (4)   In case of mixed uses, the total requirement for off-street loading
space shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed
separately as specified in the preceding sections, and the off-street loading
space for one (1) use shall not be considered as providing the required off-
street loading space for any other use.
      (5)   Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the joint
use of off-street parking or off-street loading for two (2) or more buildings
or uses, if the total of such spaces when used together shall not be less than
the sum of the requirement for the various individual uses computed separately
in accordance with the preceding sections. Provision for the maintenance and
repair of such joint parking and loading facilities shall be made.
      (6)   All off-street parking areas in any district which adjoin an
interior lot line or street lot line shall be provided with wheel stops of
masonry, concrete, steel or heavy timber, such wheel stops to be securely
anchored and attached near such interior or street lot lines so as to prevent
the protrusion of vehicles into adjoining property or public streets.
      (7)   No access way to any parking area shall be located within twenty
(20) feet of any street intersection. At intersections where traffic control
devices are installed the requirement may be increased as necessary to prevent
hazards. Parking area access ways (including residential driveways) shall
intersect at right angles to the primary public street serving that property.
      (8)   No certificate of occupancy will be issued upon completion of any
building or repair operations unless and until all off-street parking
requirements, shown upon the plans, or made a part of the building permit,
shall be in place and ready for use.

Section 13.13. Off-street loading.
      (1)   Purpose. Off-street loading shall be provided which is adequate for
the use located on the zoning lot. Off-street loading facilities shall be
provided to allow adequate ingress and egress to establishments, buildings,
structures, or uses upon each zoning lot in a manner which will not interfere
with the movement of vehicular traffic to and from the zoning lot or adjacent
public streets and ways.
      (2)   Access. Each off-street loading space shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movements upon the zoning lot and the street
or alley. All such access ways shall be not less than twelve (12) feet in
width.
      (3)   Buffer strips. Off-street loading spaces for vehicles over two (2)
tons capacity shall not be closer than fifty (50) feet to any property in a
residential district unless such loading space is completely enclosed by a
building, walls, a solid fence, or a foliage buffer not less than ten (10) feet
in height.
      (4)   Location of off-street loading spaces. All loading spaces, whether
permitted or required, shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use
served, shall not be located within fifty (50) feet of the intersection of any
two (2) streets, and shall not be located within required front yards for the
zoning lot.
      (5)   Loading facility not to be used for parking. Space allocated to any
off-street parking loading berth shall not, while so allocated, be used to
satisfy any space requirements for off-street parking facilities on the zoning
lot or portions thereof.
      (6)   Size. Unless otherwise specified, a required loading space shall be
at least fourteen (14) feet in width by fifty (50) feet in length, and shall
have a vertical clearance of not less than fourteen (14) feet, or such greater
size as may be needed to accommodate vehicles so that no vehicle loading or
unloading overhangs into the public right-of-way or interferes with internal
circulation upon the zoning lot. Reasonably adequate turning and maneuvering
space shall be provided in addition to the minimum sized loading space
requirements.
      (7)   Surfacing. Loading areas in all districts and uses including
driveways, shall be paved, and loading areas shall be properly graded for
drainage, maintained in good condition, and improved with:
         (a)   A 1.5" Surface Course; Mix C, Class 1, Type 2; 2.5" Binder
Course, Mix B, Class 1, Type 2; 8" Sub-Base Crushed Stone, Type A; Woven or
nonwoven pavement fabric; or
         (b)   A 1.5" Surface Course; Mix C, Class 1, Type 2; 1.5" Binder
Course; Mix B, Class 1, Type 2; 8" Emulsified Asphalt Base; or
         (c)   A 6" P.C. Concrete Pavement, 12" Lime Modified Soil Base (40#
lime/SY); or
         (d)   A 6" P.C. Concrete Pavement, 4" Sub-Base Crushed Stone, Type A;
Woven or nonwoven pavement fabric.
In any application or use where traffic loading warrants additional paving
thickness, the city engineer may require submission of a pavement design for
the loading areas.
      (8)   Loading spaces required. Off-street loading facilities shall be
provided on the basis of gross floor area of the establishment, building,
structure, or use which is subject to the requirement for such off-street
loading and shall be provided at a ratio of one (1) loading space for the first
ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area per building with one (1)
additional loading space at the rate of one (1) space for each additional
fourteen thousand (14,000) square feet of gross floor area.
      (9)   Joint off-street loading. See section
13.11(5).
      (10)   No certificate of occupancy will be issued upon completion of any
building or repair operations unless and until all off-street loading
requirements, shown upon the plans, or made a part of the building permit,
shall be in place and ready for use.
(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 22, 3-26-10)
Section 13.14. Existing parking and existing loading facilities.
Any establishment that does not provide the minimum number of parking and
loading spaces required by this article shall not be allowed to further reduce
the amount of parking and loading space. No existing parking or loading area
which complies with this article shall be decreased so as to become a
nonconforming area.
When the existing use of a structure is damaged or destroyed by means other
than usual deterioration, the structure may be repaired or rebuilt. Parking and
loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored, but additional parking and loading facilities
need not be provided.
Whenever the use of any structure or premises is substantially altered, spaces
shall be provided to satisfy the requirements of this article.

(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 22, 3-26-10)
ARTICLE XIV. NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
Section 14.1. Intent.
It is the intent of this ordinance to regulate existing, legal nonconforming
lots, structures, or uses until they are removed and not to encourage their
survival.
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this
ordinance and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and use of land and
structures which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance
or future amendments.
Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses
in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that non-
conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.2. Nonconforming lots.
In any one-family residential district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record which is under
separate and distinct ownership from adjacent lots at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to
the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement
variances may be sought through approval of the zoning board of appeals.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.3. Nonconforming uses of land.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, lawful
use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this
ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
      (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
      (3)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for this district in
which such land is located.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.4. Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than fifty (50) per cent of its current market value, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
Excluded from the provisions of this sub-paragraph are accessory buildings with
a nonconformity being the set-back from a side or rear lot line as long as the
nonconformity is not increased in the reconstruction and the reconstruction
occurs within ninety (90) days of the destruction.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is removed.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.5. Nonconforming uses of structures and land.
If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that
would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification provided that
the zoning board of appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in
the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the zoning board of appeals may require conditions and
safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this ordinance. Where a
nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in combination is
hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed
to a less conforming use.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for six (6) consecutive
months or eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, the structure,
or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except
in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Structures occupied by seasonal uses (one (1) season out of each year) shall be
excepted from this provision.
      (6)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.6. Repairs and maintenance.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may
be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or
on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to
an extent not exceeding fifty (50) per cent of the current market value of the
building provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the
time of passage or amendment of this ordinance shall not be increased.
Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.7. Special use interpretation.
Any special use as provided for in this ordinance shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a conforming
use in such district.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.8. Nonconforming use—Amortization.
Any adult use which lawfully existed prior to the passage of this zoning
ordinance, or which becomes nonconforming as a result of the expansion of the
city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, may be continued as hereinafter provided:
      (1)   Upon written notice from the city to the owners or interests
therein that any building, structure, lot or regulated use is nonconforming
under the provisions of the zoning ordinance, as amended, the owners or
interests therein shall, within two (2) months from the date of such notice,
apply to the city clerk for a certificate of nonconformance.
      (2)   Failure to apply for a certificate of nonconformance within two (2)
months of the notice provided above will require the amortization of the
nonconformance and the adult use shall cease operation within six (6) months of
the notice provided for above.
      (3)   Nonconformances that have applied for a certificate of
nonconformance from the city clerk shall be discontinued within one (1) year of
the notice provided above.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.9. Change of tenancy or ownership.
There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing
nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises provided there is no change
in the nature or character of such nonconforming uses.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.10. Acquisition.
The city council may acquire, by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise, private
property or an interest in private property for the removal of nonconforming
uses. The cost and expense, or a portion thereof, of acquiring the private
property may be paid from general funds or assessed to a special district in
accordance with the applicable statutory provisions relating to the creation
and operation of special assessment districts for public improvements in
cities. The elimination of the nonconforming uses and structures in a zoning
district is declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use. The city
council may institute and prosecute proceedings for condemnation of
nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent domain in
accordance with applicable state statutes.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
ARTICLE XV. TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND FACILITIES
Section 15.1. Findings.
The Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996
("the Act") grants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exclusive
jurisdiction over:
      (1)   The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF)
emissions from telecommunications facilities; and
      (2)   The regulation of radio signal interference among users of the RF
spectrum. The city's regulation of towers and telecommunications facilities in
the city will not have the effect of prohibiting any person from providing
wireless telecommunications services in violation of the Act.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 15.2. Purposes.
The general purpose of this article is to regulate the placement, construction,
and modification of towers and telecommunications facilities in order to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time
not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless
telecommunications marketplace in the city.
Specifically, the purposes of this article are:
      (1)   To regulate the location of towers and telecommunications
facilities in the city;
      (2)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of towers and telecommunications facilities;
      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impact of towers and telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
      (4)   To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers;
      (5)   To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower structures
to support antenna and telecommunications facilities;
      (6)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and
telecommunications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; and
      (7)   To ensure that towers and telecommunications facilities are
compatible with surrounding land uses.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)

Section 15.5. Setbacks.
      (1)   All towers up to one hundred (100) feet in height shall be set back
on all sides a distance equal to the underlying setback requirement in the
applicable zoning district. Towers in excess of one hundred (100) feet in
height shall be set back one (1) additional foot per each foot of tower height
in excess of one hundred (100) feet.
      (2)   Setback requirements for towers shall be measured from the base of
the tower to the property line of the parcel of land on which it is located.
      (3)   Setback requirements may be modified, as provided in section
15.18(2)(a), when placement of a tower in a location which will reduce the
visual impact can be accomplished. For example, adjacent to trees which may
visually hide the tower.
(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 25, 3-26-10)
Section 15.6. Structural requirements.
All towers must be designed and certified by an engineer to be structurally
sound and, at minimum, in conformance with the building code, and any other
standards outlined in this article. All towers in operation shall be fixed to
land.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)
Section 15.7. Separation or buffer requirements.
For the purpose of this section, the separation distances between towers shall
be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of the
existing or approved structure and the proposed base, pursuant to a site plan
of the proposed tower. Tower separation distances from residentially zoned
lands shall be measured from the base of a tower to the closest point of
residentially zone property. The minimum tower separation distances from
residentially zoned land and from other towers shall be calculated and applied
irrespective of city jurisdictional boundaries.
      (1)   Towers shall be separated from all residentially zoned lands by a
minimum of 200 feet or 200 percent of the height of the proposed tower,
whichever is greater.

conditional use in accordance with the following:
         (a)   In addition to the requirement for a tower application, the
application for modification shall include the following:
            1.   A description of how the plan addresses any adverse impact
that might occur as a result of approving the modification.
            2.   A description of off-site or on-site factors which mitigate
any adverse impacts which might occur as a result of the modification.
            3.   A technical study that documents and supports the criteria
submitted by the applicant upon which the request for modification is based.
The technical study shall be certified by an engineer and shall document the
existence of the facts related to the proposed modifications and its
relationship to surrounding rights-of-way and properties.
            4.   For a modification of the setback requirement, the application
shall identify all parcels of land where the proposed tower could be located,
attempts by the applicant to contract and negotiate an agreement for
collocation, and the result of such attempts.
            5.   The zoning officer may require the application to be reviewed
by an independent engineer under contract to the city to determine whether the
antenna study supports the basis for the modification requested. The cost of
review by the city's engineer shall be reimbursed to the city by the applicant.
         (b)   The zoning commission shall consider the application for
modification based on the following criteria:
            1.   That the tower as modified will be compatible with and not
adversely impact the character and integrity of surrounding properties.
            2.   Off-site or on-site conditions exist which mitigate the
adverse impacts, if any, created by the modification.
            3.   In addition, the board may include conditions on the site
where the tower is to be located if such conditions are necessary to preserve
the character and integrity of the neighborhoods affected by the proposed tower
and mitigate any adverse impacts which arise in connection with the approval of
the modification.
      (2)   In addition to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section,
in the following cases, the applicant must also demonstrate, with written
evidence, the following:
         (a)   In the case of a requested modification to the setback
requirement, section
15.5, that the setback requirement cannot be met on the parcel of land upon
which the tower is proposed to be located and the alternative for the person is
to locate the tower at another site which is closer in proximity to a
residentially zoned land.
         (b)   In the case of a request for modification to the separation and
buffer requirements from other towers of section
15.7, "Separation or buffer requirements," that the proposed site is zoned
"industrial" and the proposed site is at least double the minimum standard for
separation from residentially zoned lands as provided in section
15.7.
         (c)   In the case of a request for modification of the separation and
buffer requirements from residentially zoned land of section
15.7, if the person provides written technical evidence from an engineer(s)
that the proposed tower and telecommunications facilities must be located at
the proposed site in order to meet the coverage requirements of the applicant's
wireless communications system and if the person is willing to create approved
landscaping and other buffers to screen the tower from being visible to
residentially zoned property.
         (d)   In the case of a request for modification of the height limit
for towers and telecommunications facilities or to the minimum height
requirements for antenna support structures, that the modification is necessary
to: (i) facilitate collocation of telecommunications facilities in order to
avoid construction of a new tower; or (ii) to meet the coverage requirements of
the applicant's wireless communications system, which requirements must be
documented with written, technical evidence from an engineer(s) that
demonstrates that the height of the proposed tower is the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily, and no tower that is taller than such
minimum height shall be approved.
(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 28, 3-26-10)
Section 15.19. Abandonment.
      (1)   If any antenna/tower shall ceased to be used for a period of three
hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days, the city council shall notify the
owner, with a copy to the applicant, that the site will be subject to a
determination by the city council that such site has been abandoned. The owner
shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of said notice to show, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the tower has been in use or under repair
during the period. If the owner fails to show that the antenna/tower has been
in use or under repair during the period, the city council shall issue a final
determination of abandonment for the site. Upon issuance of the final
determination of abandonment, the owner shall, within seventy-five (75) days,
dismantle and remove the tower. If there are two (2) or more users of a single
tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease
using the tower.
      (2)   The owner of any approved antenna or tower shall post a bond or
other surety, at the time of construction, payable to the city. The bond or
surety shall be equivalent to the cost of demolition or removal of the proposed
facility in the event said owner is unable or unwilling to remove an abandoned
antenna or tower in conformance with the provision hereof. In order to
establish the bond or surety amount the owner/applicant at the time of
application shall provide the city with an estimate for the cost for demolition
or removal of the proposed tower/antenna. The city shall have the right to
accept or reject the owner/applicant's estimated amount. If the city rejects
the owner/applicant's estimate, the city may substitute its own estimate for
the cost of removal or demolition of the proposed antenna/tower. In all cases,
if the proposed tower/antenna significantly varies from the tower/antenna
presented for approval, a revised estimate shall be submitted to the city by
the owner/applicant. The city shall have the right to accept, reject and/or
substitute its own revised estimate for the cost of demolition of the tower/
antenna being considered for approval. All estimates proposed by the owner/
applicant shall be certified by an engineer. The city will have the right from
the date of construction of the tower/antenna, at intervals no more than every
three (3) years, to require that the bond/surety amount be increased to reflect
changes in the Chicago Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index (All Consumers)
during the prior three (3) year period.

regulations of the applicable base district. When overlay district standards
conflict with the applicable base district standards or other regulations of
this ordinance, the regulations of the overlay district always govern. When no
special overlay district standards are specified, the base district standards
and all other applicable regulations of this ordinance will govern.
      (3)   Designation: A landmark and a historic preservation district are
hereby designated an overlay district.
(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 31, 3-26-10)

(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 31, 3-26-10)
Section 17.7. Landmark and historic preservation district designation
procedures.
The following procedures should be used for the preliminary determination of
the designation of a landmark or the designation of a historic preservation
district:
      (1)   The secretary of the commission shall schedule a public hearing,
which hearing shall be held within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the
application.
      (2)   Notice of the public hearing shall be sent by mail to the owner(s)
of record and to the applicant(s) as well as to the adjoining property owners,
and a copy thereof shall be published in a newspaper having a general
circulation in the city, not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty
(30) days prior to the date of the hearing. The notice shall state the date,
time, place and purpose of the public hearing as well as the location of the
property and shall contain a statement summarizing how the proposed landmark or
proposed historic preservation district meets the criteria set forth in this
article.
      (3)   During the public hearing, the historic preservation commission
shall hear testimony and shall review and evaluate the application according to
the criteria established by this article.
      (4)   If at the end of the public hearing the historic preservation
commission finds that the application merits further consideration, then the
historic preservation commission may reschedule the request until its next
scheduled meeting.
      (5)   A decision shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date
of the closing of the public hearing or of the rescheduled meeting.
      (6)   The decision by the historic commission whether or not the
structure, building or site should be designated a landmark or whether or not
the area should be designated a historic preservation district shall be made by
resolution passed by a majority of the commission.
      (7)   Following the commission's decision, the secretary of the historic
preservation commission shall promptly prepare the historic preservation
commission's evaluation, recommendation and all available information for
submission to the city council which shall act upon the application within
sixty (60) days of receipt of the information from the secretary.
      (8)   The applicant(s) and the owner(s) of record shall be notified
promptly by a letter containing the historic preservation commission's
decision.
      (9)   A simple majority vote by the city council is necessary for
approval of a landmark or historic preservation district designation, unless
the historic preservation commission has recommended to deny the application,
in which case a seventh-eighths (?) majority vote is necessary. The city
council must approve the application by passage of an ordinance adopting the
designation. If the city council approves the application for a designation, a
notice shall be sent to the applicant(s) and the owner(s) of record, the zoning
officer, the city clerk's office, and recorded with the county recorder of
deeds that the area has been designated as such. If the city council denies the
petition, no petitioner or applicant can re-file or re-apply a petition for the
same designation within ninety (90) days of the denial.
      (10)   Buildings designated as historic landmarks and buildings located
within the boundaries of a historic preservation district shall be subject to
the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
(Ord. No. 10-3, §§ 1, 31, 3-26-10)
Section 17.8. Certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   Scope: Buildings designated as landmarks or included within the
boundaries of a designated historic preservation district or properties for
which a preliminary determination of eligibility has been made shall be subject
to issuance of certificates of appropriateness. A certificate of
appropriateness shall be required for alteration, construction, removal or
demolition of a proposed landmark from the date when the nomination form is
presented to the historic preservation commission until the final disposition
of the request.
      (2)   Certificate required: A certificate of appropriateness issued by
the commission shall be required before a building permit, moving permit, or
demolition permit is issued for any designated landmark or any building,
structure or site or part thereof in a historic preservation district. A
certificate of appropriateness is required if the building, structure or site
will be altered, extended, or repaired in such a manner as to produce a major
change in the exterior appearance of such building, structure or site. Such
major changes include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Major changes by addition, alteration, maintenance,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, renovation or repair.
         (b)   Any new construction and demolition in whole or in part
requiring a permit from the city.
         (c)   Moving a building.
         (d)   Any construction, alteration, demolition, or removal affecting a
significant exterior architectural feature as specified in the ordinance
designating the landmark or historic preservation district.
      (3)   Exemptions from certificate:
         (a)   An exception to the certificate of appropriateness shall be made
if the applicant shows to the zoning officer that a failure to grant the permit
will cause an imminent threat to life, health or property.
         (b)   A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for
landscaping, fencing, or driveways; provided, that said landscaping, fencing or
driveway work or repair does not alter the location of said landscaping,
fencing or driveways, and does not result in an alteration of the footprint of
the structure, landscape area or fence or driveway location. In the event there
is an alteration of the footprint of the landscape area or fence or driveway,
then the certificate of appropriateness is required.
      (4)   Application: Applications for a certificate of appropriateness
shall be made available at city hall. Such applications shall be completed and
submitted to city hall and shall be forwarded to the historic preservation
commission. Every application affecting a designated landmark or any building,
structure or site or part thereof in a historic preservation district for a
demolition permit, a building permit, or a moving permit, including plans and
specifications, shall be forwarded by the zoning officer to the historic
preservation commission within seven (7) days following receipt of the
application by city hall. The application for issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness must include:
         (a)   The street address of the property involved.
         (b)   A legal description of the property involved or plat designation
(such as is available from the assessor's office or from a tax bill).
         (c)   A brief description of the present improvements situated on the
property.
         (d)   A detailed description of the construction, alteration,
demolition or use proposed, together with any architect drawings or sketches if
those services have been utilized by the applicant, and if not, a sufficient
description of the construction, alteration, demolition, and use to enable the
commission to determine what final appearance and use of the real estate will
be.
         (e)   The owner's name.
         (f)   The applicant's name.
         (g)   The developer's name, if different from the owner.
         (h)   A name of the architect or engineer, if used.
      (5)   Standards: In making a determination whether to approve or deny an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic preservation
commission shall be guided by the United States Secretary of the Interior's
"Standards for Rehabilitation".
The standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a
reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical
feasibility. Said standards being:
         (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed
in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of
the building and its site and environment.
         (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
         (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
         (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
         (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
         (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
         (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
the structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
         (h)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
         (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
         (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      (6)   Design guidelines: Design guidelines for applying the criteria for
review of certificates of appropriateness shall, at a minimum, consider the
following architectural criteria:
         (a)   Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction
should be compatible with the style and character of the landmark or of
contributing structures within a designated district and with surrounding
structures in a historic preservation district.
         (b)   Proportions of windows and doors: The proportions and
relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the
architectural style and character of the landmark or of contributing structures
within a designated district.
         (c)   Relationship of building masses and spaces: The relationship of
a structure within a historic preservation district to the open space between
it and adjoining structures should be compatible.
         (d)   Roof shape: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should
be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark or of
contributing structures within a designated district.
         (e)   Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration,
construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural
style and character and with surrounding structures in a historic preservation
district.
         (f)   Directional expression: Facades in historic preservation
districts should blend with other structures with regard to directional
expression. Structures in a historic preservation district should be compatible
with the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures.
The directional expression of a landmark after alteration, construction, or
partial demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style
and character.
         (g)   Architectural details: Architectural details, including types of
materials, colors, and textures, should be treated so as to make the landmark
compatible with its original architectural style and character of a landmark or
of contributing structures within a designated district.
         (h)   New structures: New structures in a historic preservation
district shall be compatible with the architectural styles and design in said
district.
      (7)   Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness: Upon approval of the
application, the historic preservation commission shall direct the recording
secretary to issue the signed certificate of appropriateness to the applicant
with copies forwarded to the zoning officer. A certificate of appropriateness
shall be invalid if changes in the plans reviewed by the historic preservation
commission are necessary in obtaining a building permit or if the building
permit issued for the same work becomes invalid. The certificate of
appropriateness remains valid for the same period of validity as the building
permit.
      (8)   Appeals: In the event of denial of an application for a certificate
of appropriateness, the applicant may, within thirty (30) days of the denial,
amend the application to accommodate the historic preservation commission
objections, apply to the commission for a certificate of economic hardship or
appeal the denial to the city council. The city council shall act on said
appeal within sixty (60) days. Denials appealed to the city council require a
seven-eighths (?) majority vote of the city council members present to overturn
a negative recommendation of the historic preservation commission.

Section 17.9. Certificate of economic hardship.
      (1)   Scope: Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this article to the
contrary, the historic preservation commission may issue a certificate of
economic hardship to allow the performance of work for which a certificate of
appropriateness has been denied. Applicants claiming economic hardship shall be
required to seek rehabilitation assistance. The eligibility for and
availability of financial aid shall be considered by the historic preservation
commission in making its decision.
      (2)   Required information: An applicant for a certificate of economic
hardship may submit any or all of the following information in order to assist
the historic preservation commission in making its determination on the
application:
         (a)   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the

from the property for the previous two (2) years, itemized operating and
maintenance expenses for the previous two (2) years, and annual cash flow
before and after debt service, if any, during the same period; form of
ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit
or not for profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture or other.
         (i)   Any other information, including income tax bracket of the
owner, applicant or principal investors in the property, reasonably necessary
for a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield
a reasonable return to present or future owners.
      (3)   Delay of application: If the historic preservation commission finds
that without approval of the proposed work, the property owner cannot obtain a
reasonable economic return therefrom, then the application shall be delayed for
a period not to exceed three (3) months. During this period of delay, the
historic preservation commission shall investigate plans and make
recommendations to the city council to allow for reasonably beneficial use or a
reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. Such
plans and recommendations may include, but are not limited to: a relaxation of
the provisions of this article, a reduction in real property taxes, financial
assistance, and/or changes in zoning regulations.
      (4)   Issuance or denial of certificate: If, by the end of the three (3)
month period, the historic preservation commission has found that without
approval of the proposed work, the property cannot be put to a reasonable
beneficial use, or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return
therefrom, then the historic preservation commission shall issue a certificate
of economic hardship approving the proposed work. If the historic preservation
commission finds otherwise, it shall deny the application for a certificate of
economic hardship.
      (5)   Appeals: When a certificate of economic hardship is denied for
either a landmark or a structure within a historic preservation district, the
applicant(s) may, within thirty (30) days of the denial, appeal the historic
preservation commission's decision to the city council. The city council may
receive comments on the contents of the record, but no new matter may be
considered by the city council. The city council shall, within sixty (60) days,
affirm the decision or recommend changes by a majority vote of the city council
after due consideration of the facts contained in the record submitted to the
council by the historic preservation commission. A seven-eighths (?) majority
vote of the city council members present is required to overturn a negative
recommendation of the historic preservation commission. If the city council
decides that a certificate of economic hardship should be issued, the secretary
shall notify the applicant and the zoning officer within seven (7) days of the
city council's decision, and the zoning officer then shall issue the permit
within fifteen (15) days. If the city council concurs with the historic
preservation commission's decision not to issue a certificate of economic
hardship, the secretary shall notify the applicant and the zoning officer
within seven (7) days.

topographical conditions of the property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished for a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were to be carried out.

are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally, to other property with the same zoning classification.
         (c)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make money out of the property.
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this ordinance
and has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property.
         (e)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
         (f)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of
the public street, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
(Ord. No. 10-3, § 1, 3-26-10)

of the zoning officer. An appeal to the board is appropriate when an applicant

has improperly interpreted the regulation and that the proper interpretation
would allow the applicant's proposed action.
