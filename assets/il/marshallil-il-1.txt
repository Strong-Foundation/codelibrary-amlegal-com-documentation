others in similar circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Intra-governmental and inter-governmental gifts. For the purpose
of this article, "intragovernmental gift" means any gift given to an officer or

ARTICLE IX. SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
Sec. 2-381. Prohibition on sexual harassment.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Marshall to prohibit harassment of
any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee,
municipal agency or municipal office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or municipal offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , Â§ I, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-382. Definition of sexual harassment.
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual's employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Verbal harassment: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Non-verbal harassment: Suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
"catcalls," "smacking" or "kissing" noises.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Physical harassment: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Textual/electronic harassment: "Sexting" (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person."
(Ord. No. 20-07 , Â§ II, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-383. Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator or the chief elected official of the municipality.
The employee experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual harassment must not
assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and
the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official
of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , Â§ III, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-384. Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal office
shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee or official
due to a municipal employee's or official's:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in the terms or
conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation
for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a report made
in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected
from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State
Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower
protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits retaliatory
action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of
promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any
of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not
retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil
rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which she/he
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over
for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , Â§ IV, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-385. Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual
harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to $5,000.00 per offense, applicable disciplinary actions or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. No. 20-07 , Â§ V, 7-13-20)
Sec. 2-386. Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the state officials and employees ethics act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State Police, a
state's attorney, the attorney general or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000.00 against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

Sec. 14-42. Control of vicious or dangerous dogs; complaints; violations,
penalty.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No dog shall be deemed vicious if it bites, attacks, or menaces a
trespasser on the property of its owner or harms or menaces anyone who has
tormented or abused it or is a professionally trained dog for law enforcement
or guard duties. Vicious dogs shall not be classified in a manner that is
specific as to breed. If a dog is found to be a vicious dog, the dog shall be
subject to enclosure.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which
has been found to be a vicious dog unless such dog is at all times kept in an
enclosure. The only time that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure
is if it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the
dog, or to comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, provided
that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a chain having a tensile
strength of 300 pounds and not exceeding three feet in length, and shall be
under the direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dog.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not
confined to an enclosure shall be impounded by the administrator, an animal
control warden or the police department and shall be turned over to a licensed
veterinarian for destruction by lethal injection.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If the owner of the dog impounded under this section has not appealed
the impoundment order to the circuit court in the county in which the animal
was impounded within seven working days, the dog may be humanely dispatched. A
dog found to be a vicious dog shall not be released to the owner until the
administrator, an animal control warden or the director approves the enclosure
as defined in this section.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance by
permitting any dangerous dog or other animal to leave the premises of its owner
when not under control by leash or other recognized control method.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this section; provided, that an attack or injury to a person occurs while the
dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this
section, each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in
accordance with 510 ILCS 5/8. It shall be the duty of the owner of such
exempted dog to notify the administrator of any change of address. In the case
of a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the administrator advised of the
location where such dog will be stationed. The administrator shall provide
police and fire departments with a categorized list of such exempted dogs, and
shall promptly notify such departments of any address changes reported to him.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â The administrator, the city attorney, or any citizen of the city may
file a complaint in the name of the people of the city to enjoin all persons
from maintaining or permitting a dangerous or vicious dog, to abate the same,
and to enjoin the owner of such dog or other animal from permitting such animal
to leave his premises when not under control by leash or other recognized
control methods. Upon the filing of a complaint in the circuit court, the
court, if satisfied that a nuisance may exist, shall grant a preliminary
injunction with bond in such amount as the court may determine enjoining the
defendant from maintaining such nuisance. If the existence of the nuisance is
established, the owner of such dog or other animal shall be in violation of
this section, and, in addition, the court shall enter an order restraining the
owner from maintaining such nuisance and may order that such dog or other
animal be humanely dispatched.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Violations; penalties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any person violating or aiding in or abetting the violation of any
provision of this section or resisting, obstructing or impeding the
administrator or any authorized officer in enforcing this section, is guilty of
a petty offense for a first or second offense and shall be fined according to
the provisions of section
1-5 of this Code, and for a third and subsequent offense is guilty of a class C
misdemeanor. Each day a person fails to comply constitutes a separate offense.
The city attorney upon the report of any violation from the police department
shall cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted in the proper courts
without delay and to be prosecuted in the manner provided by law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the owner of a dog subject to enclosure:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Fails to maintain or keep the dog in an enclosure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The dog inflicts great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement or
permanent physical disability upon any other person or causes the death of
another person; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The attack is unprovoked in a place where such person is
peaceably conducting himself and where such person may lawfully be; such owner
shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than the maximum provided in
subsection 1-5(a) of this Code for each such violation (each day a person fails
to comply shall constitute a separate violation) and shall be subject to a
sentence of imprisonment for not more than 30 days.

comfort of the animal, or to cruelly or unnecessarily expose any such animal in
hot, stormy, cold or inclement weather.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort to any
animal, shade shall be provided by natural or artificial means to allow

the entrance covered by a flexible, windproof material, so as to keep the
animal clean, dry and comfortable. Whenever the outdoor temperature is below 40
degrees Fahrenheit, clean, dry bedding material shall be provided in such

become entangled with another animal or object, and shall be of sufficient
length in proportion to the size of the animal to allow the animal proper

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The term "fireproof construction" as used in this article means a
building in which all parts that carry loads or resist strains and all exterior
walls and all interior walls or partitions and all stairways and elevator
enclosures are made of incombustible materials, and in which all metallic
structural members are protected against the effects of fire by being
completely embedded in a material which shall be entirely incombustible and a
slow heat conductor. If the metal framework of a roof is not less than 25 feet
above any floor or balcony, fireproofing of members of the roof framework may
be omitted. If the metal framework of a roof is more than 18 feet and less than
25 feet above any floor or balcony, then the roof framework may be protected by
a suspended ceiling of metal lath and Portland cement plaster not less than one
inch thick.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The fireproof covering on columns shall be not less than two inches
thick if of concrete or gunite, or three inches thick if of other material; on
girders, not less than two inches thick; on other structural parts, not less
than 1Â½ inches thick. The thickness shall be outside the extreme edges of the
structural members.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The following building materials, systems, units and forms of
construction, assembled and constructed as required in this section, shall be
accepted as fireproof construction:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Plain or reinforced concrete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reinforced gunite.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Precast reinforced concrete units.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Hollow or solid concrete masonry units.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Brick (clay, sand-lime or concrete).

Sec. 18-185. Failure to abate.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Demolition, repair or enclosure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The city attorney shall, when requested to do so by the mayor, the
mayor's designated representative or the city council, pursuant to section 11-
31-1(a) of the Illinois Municipal Code 1 Â apply to the circuit court (i) for an
order authorizing action to be taken with respect to a dangerous building if
the owner or owners of the building, including the lienholders of record, after
15 days written notice by mail or by personal service so to do, have failed to
put the building in a safe condition or to demolish it or (ii) for an order
requiring the owner or owners of record to demolish, repair or enclose the
building or to remove garbage, debris and other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy
substances or materials from the building. It is not a defense to the cause of
action that the building is boarded up or otherwise enclosed, although the
court may order the defendant to have the building boarded up or otherwise
enclosed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the mayor, the mayor's designated representative or the city
council determines that any dangerous building fulfills the requirements for an
action by the city under the Illinois Abandoned Housing Rehabilitation Act 2 Â ,
the city may petition under that act in a proceeding brought under this
subsection.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Money judgment. In any case where the city has obtained a lien under
subsection (a), the city shall also bring an action for a money judgment
against the owner or owners of the real estate in the amount of the lien in the
same manner as provided for bringing causes of action in Article II of the
Illinois Code of Civil Procedure 3 Â and upon obtaining a judgment, file a
judgment lien against all of the real estate of the owner or owners and enforce
that lien as provided for in Article XII of the Illinois Code of Civil
Procedure 4 Â .
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Injunction to require compliance. If the mayor, the mayor's designated
representative or the city council determines, upon due investigation, that any
building or structure herein fails to conform to the minimum standards of
health and safety as set forth in the ordinances of this city, and the owner or
owners of such building or structure fails, after due notice as provided in
this article, to cause such property to so conform, the city attorney may,
pursuant to section 11-31-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code 5 Â , make
application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring compliance of such
ordinances or for such other order as the court may deem necessary or
appropriate to secure such compliance.

Sec. 18-186. Alternate actions.
In addition to the actions authorized by other sections of this article:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Declaration of abandonment. In addition to any other remedy provided
by law, the city may, pursuant to section 11-31-1(d) of the Illinois Municipal
Code 1 Â , petition the circuit court to have property declared abandoned if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The property has been tax delinquent for two or more years, or
bills for water service for the property have been outstanding for two or more
years;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The property contains a dangerous or unsafe building.
The city may proceed under this subsection in a proceeding brought under the
previous section.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Expedited removal of certain buildings. The city may use the
provisions of this subsection to expedite the removal of certain buildings that
are a continuing hazard to the community.
If a residential or commercial building is three stories or less in height as
defined by the city's building code, and the corporate official designated to
be in charge of enforcing the city's building code determines that the building
is open and vacant and an immediate and continuing hazard to the community,
then the official shall be authorized to post a notice not less than two feet
by two feet in size on the front of the building. The notice shall be dated as
of the date of the posting and shall state that unless the building is
demolished, repaired or enclosed, and unless any garbage, debris, and other
hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy substances or materials are removed so that an
immediate and continuing hazard to the community no longer exists, then the
building may be demolished, repaired, or enclosed, or any garbage, debris and
other hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy substances or materials may be removed,
by the city.
Not later than 30 days following the posting of the notice, the city shall do
all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Cause to be sent, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a
notice to remediate to all owners of record of the property, the beneficial
owners of any Illinois land trust having title to the property, and all
lienholders of record in the property, stating the intent of the city to
demolish, repair or enclose the building or remove any garbage, debris or other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials if that action is not
taken by the owner or owners.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Cause to be published, in a newspaper published or circulated in
the city, a notice setting forth (i) the permanent tax index number and the
address of the building, (ii) a statement that the property is open and vacant
and constitutes an immediate and continuing hazard to the community, and (iii)
a statement that the city intends to demolish, repair or enclose the building
or remove any garbage, debris, or other hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy
substances or materials if the owner or owners or lienholders of record fail to
do so. This notice shall be published for three consecutive days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Cause to be recorded the notice to remediate mailed under paragraph
(1) in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Clark County.
A person or persons with a current legal or equitable interest in the property
objecting to the proposed actions of the city may file his or her objection in
an appropriate form in a court of competent jurisdiction.
If the building is not demolished, repaired or enclosed, or the garbage, debris
or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials are not
removed, within 30 days of mailing the notice to the owners of record, the
beneficial owners of any Illinois land trust having title to the property, and
all lienholders of record in the property, or within 30 days of the last day of
publication of the notice, whichever is later, the city shall have the power to
demolish, repair or enclose the building or to remove any garbage, debris or
other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials.
The city may proceed to demolish, repair or enclose a building or remove any
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials under this subsection within a 120-day period following the date of
the mailing of the notice if the appropriate official determines that the
demolition, repair, enclosure or removal of any garbage, debris or other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials is necessary to remedy
the immediate and continuing hazard. If, however, before the city proceeds with
any of the actions authorized by this subsection, any person with a legal or
equitable interest in the property has sought a hearing under Section 11-31-1
(e) of the Illinois Municipal Code 2 Â before a court and has served a copy of
the complaint on the mayor of the city, then the city shall not proceed with
the demolition, repair, enclosure or removal of garbage, debris or other
substances until the court determines that that action is necessary to remedy
the hazard and issues an order authorizing the city to do so. If the court
dismisses the action for want of prosecution, the city must send the objector a
copy of the dismissal order and a letter stating that the demolition, repair,
enclosure, or removal of garbage, debris, or other substances will proceed
unless, within 30 days after the copy of the order and the letter are mailed,
the objector moves to vacate the dismissal and serves a copy of the motion on
the mayor of the city. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if the
objector does not file a motion and give the required notice, if the motion is
denied by the court, or if the action is again dismissed for want of
prosecution, then the dismissal is with prejudice and the demolition, repair,
enclosure, or removal may proceed forthwith.
Following the demolition, repair or enclosure of a building, or the removal of
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials under this subsection, the city may file a notice of lien against the
real estate for the cost of demolition, repair, enclosure or removal within 180
days after the repair, demolition, enclosure or removal occurred, for the cost
and expenses incurred, in the office of the recorder of deeds. This lien has
priority over the interests of those parties named in the notice to remediate
mailed under paragraph (1), but not over the interest of third-party purchasers
or encumbrancers for value who obtained their interests in the property before
obtaining actual or constructive notice of the lien. The notice of lien shall
consist of a sworn statement setting forth (i) a description of the real
estate, such as the address or other description of the property, sufficient
for its identification; (ii) the expenses incurred by the city in undertaking
the remedial actions authorized under this subsection; (iii) the date or dates
the expenses were incurred by the city; (iv) a statement by the corporate
official responsible for enforcing the building code that the building was open
and vacant and constituted an immediate and continuing hazard to the community;
(v) a statement by the corporate official that the required sign was posted on
the building, that notice was sent by certified mail to the owners of record,
and that notice was published in accordance with this subsection; and (vi) a
statement as to when and where the notice was published. The lien authorized by
this subsection may thereafter be released or enforced by the city as provided
in subsection (a).
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Hazardous substances and petroleum products on, in, or under abandoned
and unsafe property. The city may remove or cause the removal of, or otherwise
environmentally remediate hazardous substances and petroleum products, on, in,
or under any abandoned and unsafe property within the city. In addition, where
preliminary evidence indicates the presence or likely presence of a hazardous
substance or a petroleum product or a release or a substantial threat of a
release of a hazardous substance or a petroleum product on, in, or under the
property, the city may inspect the property and test for the presence or
release of hazardous substances and petroleum products. For purposes of this
subsection (c):
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "Property" or "real estate" means all real property, whether or not
improved by a structure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â "Abandoned" means:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The property has been tax delinquent for two or more years;
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â "Unsafe" means property that presents an actual or imminent threat
to public health and safety caused by the release of hazardous substances; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â "Hazardous substances" means the same as in Section 3.215 of the
Environmental Protection Act 3 Â .
The city attorney shall, pursuant to Section 11-31-1(f) of the Illinois
Municipal Code 4 Â apply to the circuit court (i) for an order allowing the city
to enter the property and inspect and test the substances on, in, or under the
property; or (ii) for an order authorizing the city to take action with respect
to remediation of the property if conditions on the property, based on the
inspection and testing authorized in paragraph (i) indicate the presence of
hazardous substances or petroleum products.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Remedy of fire hazards. The fire chief of the fire protection district
or any municipal official whose duty it is to investigate fires may make
investigations authorized by Sections 9 through 9e of the Illinois Fire
Investigation Act 5 Â . If such officer shall find that any building or
structure is so occupied or situated as to endanger persons or property, or by
reason of faulty construction, age, lack of repair, or for any other cause is
especially liable to fire or is liable to cause injury by collapsing or
otherwise, such officer shall order the dangerous condition removed or
remedied, and shall so notify the owner, occupant or other person interested in
the premises. Service of such notice may be made in person or by registered or
certified mail, and any person so notified may appeal from the decision of such
officer in the manner provided by law.

(Ord. No. 07-23, Â§ 1, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-202. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following definitions are adopted:
Â Â Â Base flood: The flood having a one-percent probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood.
The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section
18-203 of this article.
Â Â Â Base flood elevation (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
Â Â Â Building: A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and gas
or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and
travel trailers installed on a site for more than 180 days per year.
Â Â Â Critical facility: Any public or private facility which, if flooded, would
create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life
and health. Examples are public buildings, emergency operations and
communication centers, health care facilities and nursing homes, schools, and
toxic waste treatment, handling or storage facilities.
Â Â Â Development: Any manmade change to real estate including, but not
necessarily limited to:
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building,
Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â Substantial improvement of an existing building;
Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for
a manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days per year;
Â Â Â (iv)Â Â Â Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts
or similar projects;
Â Â Â (v)Â Â Â Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls, or fences;
Â Â Â (vi)Â Â Â Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving, or
other alterations of the ground surface;
Â Â Â (vii)Â Â Â Storage of materials including the placement of gas and liquid
storage tanks; and
Â Â Â (viii)Â Â Â Channel modifications or any other activity that might change the
direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
Development does not include routine maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar practices
that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
Â Â Â FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Â Â Â Flood: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
Â Â Â Flood fringe: That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.
Â Â Â Flood insurance rate map: A map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (SFHA) within a
community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or may not depict
floodways and show base flood elevations.
Â Â Â Floodplain: Those lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are subject
to inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of Big Creek are generally
identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of the city prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 2, 2007. The floodplains
of those parts of unincorporated Clark County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city
are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for
Clark County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 2,
2007. Floodplain also includes those areas of known flooding as identified by
the community.
Â Â Â Floodproofing: Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.
Â Â Â Floodproofing certificate: A form published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that is used to certify that a building has been designed and
constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection
elevation.
Â Â Â Flood protection elevation (FPE): The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
Â Â Â Floodway: That portion of the floodplain required to store and convey the
base flood. The floodways for each of the floodplains of the city shall be
according to the best data available from federal, state, or other sources.
Â Â Â IDNR/OWR: Illinois Department of Natural Resources/Office of Water
Resources.
Â Â Â Manufactured home: A structure transportable in one or more sections, that
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
Â Â Â NFIP: National Flood Insurance Program.
Â Â Â Repetitive loss: Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25 percent
of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Â Â Â Special flood hazard area (SFHA): See definition of "floodplain". Floodplain
and special flood hazard area are synonymous.
Â Â Â Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination.
Â Â Â Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started.
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic
Places.
Â Â Â Travel trailer (or recreational vehicle): A vehicle which is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Built on a single chassis;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Four hundred square feet or less in size;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

(Ord. No. 07-23, Â§ 4, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-205. Development permit.
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the zoning officer. The zoning officer shall not issue
a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the requirements
of this article.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the zoning
officer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation.
Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to be higher
than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled after the
date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is not in the floodplain and
therefore not subject to the requirements of this article. Conversely, any
development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and
hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood insurance rate map
is subject to the provisions of this article. The zoning officer shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first flood insurance rate map identification.

(Ord. No. 07-23, Â§ 10, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-211. Variances.
Whenever the standards of this article place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to zoning board of appeals for a
variance. The zoning board of appeals shall review the applicant's request for
a variance and may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this article.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not

public facilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application
fee of $150.00.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The zoning board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that
a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of
section
18-207 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25.00
per $100.00 of insurance coverage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Increase the risks to life and property; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Variances to the building protection requirements of section
18-207 of this article requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair
or alteration of a site or building included on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places may be granted
using criteria more permissive than the requirements of subsection
18-211(a)(1)-(7).
(Ord. No. 07-23, Â§ 11, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-212. Disclaimer of liability.
The degree of protection required by this article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This ordinance does not create liability on the part
of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this article or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. No. 07-23, Â§ 12, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-213. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this article and other easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 07-23, Â§ 13, 6-25-07)
Sec. 18-214. Penalty.
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this article. Upon due investigation, the zoning officer may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this article exists. The
zoning officer shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â If such owner fails after ten days' notice to correct the violation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The city shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this article or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the ordinance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any person who violates this article shall upon conviction thereof
be fined according to section
1-5 of the city's Code of Ordinances; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The city shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The zoning officer of the city shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

(Ord. No. 95-25, Â§ 3.2, 12-27-95; Ord. No. 22-12 , Â§ 1, 5-9-22)
Sec. 23-30. SameâAlternative user charge.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â This section is applicable to any licensed, but enfranchised cable
operator service provider, and to any cable who has had its franchise (or any
portion thereof) determined to be unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law, and as an
alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee, the council/franchising
authority may impose, extract and collect a charge from an effected cable
service provider for the use by such provider of the streets, rights-of-way,
easements and public ways of the city.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The alternative user charge shall be based on the following
mathematical mode:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Determine the present value of all streets, right-of-way, easements
and public ways of the city in which the cable service provider's cable system
are located;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the
city (as determined by the amount of property appraiser for the city), for the
years that the present term has been in effect;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Take the average percentage increase for the past years and use it
to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining
term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Add the present value to the dollar amount of property value
increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable
then use five years);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the
term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Multiply that figure by five percent to arrive at the annual user
charge that is to be collected from the affected cable service provider.
For purposes of illustration only, the formula reads as follows:
Present value, + dollar amount of property increase for remaining term of the
franchise (based on average percentage increase of land appraisals for past
years of franchise term), divide the adjusted value by the remaining years on
the term of the franchise, multiply that figure by five percent = the annual
alternative user charge.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The council/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user
charge, in order to receive fair compensation for the affected cable operator's
use of the streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by
imposing a flat percentage fee on such cable service provider's annual gross
revenues. However, an affected cable service provider may agree to an
alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenues, as
long as that charge does not exceed five percent of an affected cable service
provider's annual gross revenues.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on
the same cable service provider at the same time, for the same period.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â An affected cable service provider shall at no time be charged or
obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds five percent of such
provider's gross revenues for any particular reporting period. In the event
that the alternative user charge does exceed five percent of gross revenues,
then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not
greater than the five percent cap.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â An affected cable service provider shall file with the franchising
authority, within 45 days after the expiration of each of the cable service
provider's fiscal quarters, a detailed statement clearly showing the gross
revenues received by cable service provider during the preceding quarter and
certified by a certified public accountant or officer of cable service provider
attesting to the accuracy, completeness, and veracity of the revenue figures.
Revenue will be reported by service category, type and level showing
computations an using incremental billing rates for all sources, levels, tiers
and types of service and other revenue sources of all types.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Payment of the quarterly portion of the alternative user charge shall
be rendered to the franchising authority at the time the financial statement is
filed.

Sec. 52-26. Short title.
This code shall be known and may be cited as the "Manufactured Homes Code."
(Ord. No. 21-19 , Â§ 1, 11-21-21)
State law reference(s)â65 ILCS/5/11-5-8; 210 ILCS 115/18.
Sec. 52-27. Purpose of regulations.
It is deemed by the city council that it is in the best interest of the city
that the placement and location of manufactured homes upon real estate within
the corporate limits of the city be regulated.
(Ord. No. 21-19 , Â§ 1, 11-21-21)
Sec. 52-28. Definitions.
For the purpose of this Code, the following definitions shall apply, unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
Â Â Â Camper means a mobile living unit designed to be mounted upon and conveyed
by a vehicle. No camper unit shall be occupied in the city except as provided
in the zoning ordinance.
Â Â Â Livable, habitable condition means the unit is currently fit for permanent
habitation by a person. It shall include, but is not limited to, having
workable and functionable doors and windows.
Â Â Â Manufactured home means a dwelling unit designed and built in a factory,
which bears a federal label certifying that it was built in compliance with the
Federal Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Law (42 U.S.C.
5401 et. Seq.), and includes, but is not limited to, modular or prefabricated
homes created in sections then transported to the home site for construction
and installation. This does not include mobile homes or trailers, see
Chapter 53 â Mobile Homes.
Â Â Â Modular homes are created in sections, and then transported to the home site
for construction and installation. These are typically installed and treated
like a regular house, for financing, appraisal and construction purposes, and
are usually the most expensive of the three. Although the sections of the house
are prefabricated, the sections, or modules, are put together at the
construction much like a typical home. Manufactured homes, once placed on a
permanent foundation, are considered the same as modular or site build homes
for appraisal purposes.
A home complying with the terms of the city building code relating to
construction of single-family homes and placed on a foundation complying with
all of the terms of the city building code relating to single-family homes,
shall not be deemed to be a mobile home.
(Ord. No. 21-19 , Â§ 1, 11-21-21)
Sec. 52-29. Placement of manufactured home; procedure.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any owner of any real estate located in the city desiring to place a
manufactured home on said property shall first make application to the zoning
board of appeals for a variance, on a form as established by the city. The
application shall be accompanied by the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A plot plan showing the exact location and dimensions of the parcel
or lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A description and dimensions of the proposed manufactured home to
be located thereon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A drawing showing the exact location of the home on the parcel or
lot,
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Color photographs of at least three exterior sides of the proposed
manufactured home. Such photographs are to be of such quality as to enable the
viewer to judge the condition and appearance of the proposed manufactured home.
These photographs shall be supplied by the applicant at the applicant's
expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A nonrefundable application fee of $150.00.

provided, that the number of feet occupied by all public roads, streets, alleys
and other public ways shall be excluded in computing the 300 feet requirement.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The application shall be submitted to the board of appeals for
approval after the same has been submitted in proper form and in compliance
with the requirements of subsection (b) above.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Upon submission of the application to the board of appeals, the board

newspaper one time, at least 15 days and not more than 30 days before the date
of the hearing. The notice shall contain the name of the applicant, the exact
location of the parcel or lot where the proposed manufactured home is to be
placed and the date, time and the place of the hearing.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Not less than 15 nor more than 30 days before the public hearing, the
applicant shall serve written notice, either in person or by registered mail,
on the list furnished pursuant to subsection (b)(6) of this section. The notice
herein required shall be in the form in the appendix to this article, If after
a bona fide effort to determine such address by the applicant, the owner of the
property of which the notice is to be served cannot be found at his or her last
known address, or the mailed notice is returned because the owner cannot be
found at the last known address, the notice requirements of this subsection
shall be deemed satisfied (and in such case an affidavit to that effect must be
submitted to the board of appeals along with the proof of service of notice).
In addition to serving the notice herein required, at least seven days before
the hearing, the applicant shall furnish to the board of appeals a copy of the
notice and proof of service of notice in the form contained in the appendix to

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Is older than ten years in age.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the zoning board of appeals approves the application, the
applicant shall then apply for a building permit and a certificate of occupancy
as provided for in the city's zoning ordinance, and pay the necessary filing

encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure, the
permittee shall promptly notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall
be repaired by the agency or person owning them, and the expense of such
repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this subsection
(b) that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities and
any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such facility damage and
such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The
only exception will be for such instances where damage is exclusively due to
the negligence of the owning utility. The city shall not be made a party to any
action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the
existence and location of all underground facilities and protect such

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The permittee under this article shall, at all times, and at the
permittee's own expense, preserve and protect from injury any adjoining
property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for
the purpose. Where, in the protection of such property, it is necessary to
enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective
measures, the permittee shall obtain consent from the owner of such private
property for such purposes, and if he cannot obtain such consent, the
superintendent may authorize the permittee to enter the private premises solely
for the purpose of making the property safe.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The permittee under this article shall, at its own expense, shore up
and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be
damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for
all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure
to properly protect and carry out such work. Whenever it may be necessary for
the permittee to trench through any lawn area, such area shall be reseeded or
the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required in this article. All construction and maintenance work
shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and
debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before
such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or
shrubs which exist in parking street areas without first obtaining the consent
of the appropriate city department or official having supervision of such
property.

or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as not to
endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the superintendent shall have the
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the
superintendent. Whenever necessary in order to expedite the flow of traffic or
to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the
superintendent to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.

service lines designed to serve single properties, the person owning, using,
controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 30 days after such
abandonment, file with the superintendent a statement in writing giving in
detail the location of the substructure so abandoned. If such abandoned
substructure is in the way or subsequently becomes in the way of an
installation of the city or any other public body, which installation is
pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove such abandoned
substructure or pay the cost of its removal during the course of excavation for
construction of the facility by the city or any other public body.
(Code 1976, Â§ 9Â¾-164)
Sec. 70-56. Cleanup.
As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned of
all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All
cleanup operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at
the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the
superintendent. From time to time as may be ordered by the superintendent, and,
in any event, immediately after the completion of such work, the permittee
shall, at the permittee's own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and
unused materials of any kind resulting from such work, and upon failure to do
so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the superintendent,
such work may be done by the superintendent and the cost thereof charged to the
permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under
the surety bond provided under the terms of this article.

such substructure. Above the upper level of the substructure, backfill material
shall be placed to the subgrade of the pavement in lifts consistent with the
type of soil involved and the degree of consolidations specified by the city
council or superintendent. Broken pavement, large stones, roots and other
debris shall not be used in the backfill.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The number and size of each lift shall be dependent upon the type of
soil involved. Backfilling shall be done in a manner that will permit the
restoration of the surface to a density condition not less than that existing
prior to excavation, unless otherwise specified. The superintendent may require
soil tests to be furnished by a recognized soil testing laboratory or
registered professional engineer specializing in soil mechanics when, in his
opinion, backfill for any excavation is not being adequately compacted. In
order for the resurfacing to be permitted, such tests must show that the
backfill material meets the minimum requirements as prescribed by the city
council, streets and alleys committee or superintendent. All expense of such
tests shall be borne by the permittee.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â All sidewalk and concrete street excavations shall be patched with
concrete. All other street excavations shall be patched with hot bituminous
asphalt. All patching shall be at a depth required by the superintendent.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Driveways for residential or dwelling house use shall be
constructed in a manner and of a material equal at least to that existing for
the paving in the public street adjacent thereto, except that where concrete
pavement exists in the public street and bituminous or asphalt or the
equivalent surface is desired for the driveway, such surface shall be permitted
provided it shall have a minimum depth of two inches without any loose material
on top and has a base of water bound macadam at least six inches thick, and
provided that a Portland cement concrete apron not less than three feet in
width be constructed between the existing concrete pavement and the proposed
bituminous driveway surface.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across the
sidewalk space, it shall conform to the sidewalk grade as established by the
superintendent of public works.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across an
existing sidewalk, said sidewalk shall be removed and replaced with Portland
cement concrete for the full width of the driveway and for a distance of at
least 12 inches on both sides of said walk. This portion shall be not less than

house shall not exceed 30 feet at the outer or street edge of the sidewalk.
Where two or more adjoining driveways are provided for the same property, a
safety island of not less than ten feet at the outer or street side of the
sidewalk shall be provided. Not more than two such driveways shall be allowed
to any one owner for any one piece of property on any one street for each 100

line of all driveways must be approximately at right angles to the curb line of
the pavement in the public street for a distance of at least ten feet from said
curb line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â All driveways shall be so graded between the gutter and the
sidewalk that it will not be necessary to change the established grade of
either and will not elevate or depress any portion of either. No part of said

must be removed for the full depth from the top of curb to the bottom of the
pavement. The edge must be cut as above described. No combined curb and gutter,
straight curb or integral curb shall be removed within five feet of a public
crosswalk.

installed. Said culverts shall be of such size and shall be constructed of such
material as determined by the superintendent of public works, depending on the
conditions existing. In no instance shall the size opening be less than that
obtained by a 12-inch diameter pipe. The length of culvert shall be determined
by the Bowing method: For ditch depth of two feet or less the culvert shall
extend not less than five feet beyond both edges of the driveway where it
crosses the ditch. For each additional foot depth of ditch add two feet to the
above figure, except that no culvert shall be less than 20 feet long and except
that where headwalls are constructed at the ends of the culvert the length
shall be as determined by the superintendent of public works.
Where existing meter pits are in the area of a proposed driveway the existing
cast iron top shall be removed and turned into the water department. A heavier
cover shall be furnished and set by the water department, and the additional
cost thereof shall be paid by the contractor.
Where an existing catch basin is in the area of the proposed driveway, the tops
shall be removed and replaced with a manhole top with perforated lid. Said top
shall be set by the street department, and the additional cost thereof shall be
paid by the contractor.
All driveways constructed or reconstructed over, across or upon any public

Sec. 74-82. Relation to adjoining street system.
The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the
continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper
projection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as they may be
deemed necessary for public requirements. The street and alley arrangements
shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access to it. Offset streets
shall be avoided. The angle of intersection between minor streets and major
streets shall not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. Streets
obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of the
existing streets. Proposed street names that are in conflict with existing
street names shall not be approved.

forth in the Street Design Specifications Table, in right-of-way width shall be
dedicated, and whenever the property being subdivided adjoins a half street,
the remainder of the street shall be dedicated. Where a subdivision borders an
existing narrow road or when the comprehensive plan indicates plans for
realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of the land in
the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate those area for
widening or alignment of those roads. The costs of improving the realignment or
widening of the road may be shared between the city and the developer upon
determination by the council that the costs of the realignment or widening
exceed the cost of providing necessary access to the subdivision. Land reserved
for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area
requirements of the zoning ordinance.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Alleys may be provided in a residential block and, where provided,

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â General design considerations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Underground/surface system. The drainage system may provide for the
design storm indicated above by either an underground or surface drainage
system or a combination of both. If an underground system is utilized, it shall
be at least accommodate the ten-year design storm and adequate surface drainage
facilities (such as swales and ditches) shall be provided to handle the
additional flow.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Consistency with plans and regulations. Drainage facilities shall
be designed in conformity with any adopted local, regional, or levee/sanitary
district plans and/or regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. Drainage facilities large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from the entire drainage area upstream
from the proposed subdivision shall be provided in accordance with the city
engineer's specifications. Potential runoff shall be determined on the basis of
the maximum development of the upstream area that is permitted under the
current zoning district regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Retention discharge. The volume and rate of stormwater runoff
leaving the subdivision shall not substantially exceed what would have occurred
under natural, undeveloped conditions if it appears that existing or potential
downstream developments would be damaged by a greater or faster flow. Thus, if
necessary in the opinion of the commission and the city's engineer, the
subdivider shall install stormwater retention facilities in the subdivision.

Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Such quarter annual and annual returns, as to form and substance,

Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision in this article concerning the

Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Where the same person has more than one business registered with the

not file each return that is due as a single return covering all such
registered businesses, but shall file separate returns for each such registered
business.

tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, the taxpayer shall be liable for
the interest, late filing penalty, late payment penalty, and failure to file
penalty, all as provided in section 11 of the city's Locally Imposed and
Administered Tax Rights and Responsibility Ordinance [section
78-170 of this chapter], until such return is filed and payment is made as
required. The treasurer shall be authorized to compromise or waive part or all
of the interest and penalty requirements pursuant to section 12 of the City's
Locally Imposed and Administered Tax Rights and Responsibility Ordinance
[section
78-171 of this chapter].
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â The department may, upon separate written notice to a taxpayer,
require the taxpayer to prepare and file with the department on a form
prescribed by the department within not less than 30 days after receipt of the
notice an annual information return for the tax year specified in the notice.
Such annual return to the department shall include a statement of gross
receipts as shown by the operator's last state income tax return and any other
reasonable information as the department may require. If the total receipts of
the business as reported in the state income tax return do not agree with the
gross receipts reported to the department for the same period, the operator
shall attach to the annual information return a schedule showing a
reconciliation of the two amounts and the reasons for the difference. The
operator's annual information return to the department shall also disclose pay
roll information of the operator's business during the year covered by such
return and any additional reasonable information which the department deems
would be helpful in determining the accuracy of the monthly, quarterly or
annual tax returns by such operator as hereinbefore provided for in this

when and as required, the taxpayer shall be liable for a late filing penalty as
provided in section 11(b) of the city's Locally Imposed and Administered Tax
Rights and Responsibility Ordinance [section
78-170(b) of this chapter] based on the tax which became due from such taxpayer
under this article during the period to be covered by the annual return until
such return is filed as required and the penalty paid. The authority of the
treasurer to waive part or all of the previously stated penalty is also
applicable to this penalty.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â The chief executive officer, proprietor, owner or highest ranking
manager shall sign the annual return to certify the accuracy of the information
contained therein. Any person who wilfully signs the annual return containing
false or inaccurate information shall be guilty of perjury and punished
accordingly. The annual return form prescribed by the department shall include
a warning that the person signing the return may be liable for perjury.
Â Â Â (m)Â Â Â The foregoing portion of this section concerning the filing of an

subdivision of this state.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of
telecommunications through a sale at retail.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of
making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its
discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, or any like
term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission

Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment

telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may
not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and
maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as
defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-
ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a
taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by
telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are
sent.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents,
employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or
receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability
as authorized by this article.

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any

between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means
a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of one
percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.

Sec. 78-152. Collection of tax by retailers.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

information as required by the department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement the
Act.
(Ord. No. 02-13, Â§ 3, 8-14-02)
Sec. 78-154. Resellers.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

administrator's determination of the best estimate of the taxpayer's tax
liability.

Sec. 78-168. Appeal.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The local tax administrator shall send written notice to a taxpayer
upon the local tax administrator's issuance of a protestable notice of tax due,
a bill, a claim denial, or a notice of claim reduction regarding any tax. The
notice shall include the following information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The reason for the assessment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The amount of the tax liability proposed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The procedure for appealing the assessment; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The obligation of the city during the audit, appeal, refund and
collection process.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A taxpayer who receives written notice from the local tax
administrator of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the
local tax administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting
forth the basis of the taxpayers' request for a hearing. The written protest
and petition for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within

assessment.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed, the
local tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within 14 days of receipt of the written protest and petition for hearing,
unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within the
45 day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall become a final
bill due and owing without further notice.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than 90 days after the expiration of the 45 day period.

for hearing under section nine, above, the local tax administrator shall
conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a continuance
is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of
preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted
shall not exceed 14 days.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and shall
hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings

Sec. 78-170. Interest and penalties.
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Interest. The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be nine
percent per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of five percent of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a
return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent of the tax
due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided
by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25 percent of the total tax due for the applicable reporting
period for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment
penalty shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the
controlling ordinance.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(11), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-171. Abatement.
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(12), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-172. Installment contracts.
The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 20 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(13), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-173. Statute of limitations.
The city, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in

The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the reviewed tax
returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due and owing.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the city,
the tax paid was less than 75 percent of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(14), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-174. Voluntary disclosure.
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the
filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for
any period before the date of application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(15), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-175. Publication of tax ordinances.
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the city
clerk's office.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(16), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-176. Review of liens.
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. No. 00-16, Â§ 1(17), 12-27-00)
Sec. 78-177. Application.
This article shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict
with or inconsistent with this ordinance, this article shall be controlling.

(Code 1976, Â§ 12-16.1)
Sec. 86-19. Equalized payment plan.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Availability. Any customer that is not a large power purpose
electrical customer (as defined in section
86-56(4)) may elect to pay a monthly payment equal to 1/12of the average cost
of energy services for the previous 12 months, adjusted for current or
anticipated fuel costs and rates. The customer may be placed on the equalized
payment plan during any month of the year. The account is balanced with each
May billing or when service is disconnected or the customer is removed from the
equalized payment plan. The city reserves the right to cancel the customer's
participation in the plan should the customer fail to pay the equalized payment
by the due date of the monthly bill. The customer may cancel the agreement to
participate in this plan by giving 30 days' written notice to the city and by
agreeing to any necessary billing to make the account current.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Payment determination. Accumulate the number of months and meter
billings to determine the average cost per month per meter on account. Total
the average cost per meter per month for the account. Adjust the average cost
per month to reflect current or anticipated fuel costs and rates. Round upward
to the nearest whole dollar to determine the monthly equalized payment plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Accumulation of number of months must be equal to at least ten days
for the system to calculate payments. Previous customer's billing for the same
location may be used.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Meter billings include electrical, gas, water and sewer service,
state utility tax, fuel adjustment and security lights.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any customer commencing the equalized payment plan during any month
other than May must pay, before commencing participation in the plan, the
amount by which the total equalized payment plan payments from the prior May to
date (assuming participation) exceeds the total payments actually made during
such period. If more has been paid than the equalized payment plan payments
would have required, the difference shall be credited to the customer's next
billings until fully applied.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Adjustments. Equalized payment plan accounts will be mechanically
reviewed and adjusted every 12 months on the anniversary date. The May billing
shall be considered the anniversary date. A new equalized payment plan amount
will be calculated using the last 12 months' history. From the sixth through
the tenth months subsequent to the anniversary date, an audit may be
mechanically processed. Any account which has a debit balance greater than
twice the equalized payment plan payment will be placed on this audit report.
This report will include the following: name, account number, current equalized
payment plan payment amount and status. Payments may be adjusted based upon
review. Any debit balance for the last 12 months' listings will be billed with
the May billing. Any credit balance will be, at the customer's election,
credited toward the customer's next billings.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â General. Except for the equalizing of the customer's payments for
service, all other provisions, terms and conditions of the applicable rate
schedule shall continue to be applicable. Where a customer is using more than
one public utility service not at a specified location, the equalized payment
plan must be utilized for all services collectively. The city reserves the
right to designate a budget period other than the normal budget period for
application to customers whose service is seasonal in character. A method of
payment determination applicable to the designated budget period would be
applied.

assessed and billed by the city to any utility user for each check received
from such user to be applied on a utility bill, which check is returned unpaid
by the bank upon which it is drawn. Such charge shall be collected from the
user in the same manner as collection is made of charges for utility services.
Any payment made by the utility user subsequent to any such service charge
shall be applied first in payment of the service charge; second, in payment of
any penalty assessed by reason of late payment; and finally, to charges for
utility services.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Any utility user making payment by check who has two checks returned
unpaid by the bank upon which such checks are drawn within a 12-month period
must make all subsequent payments by cash, certified funds or money order.

if a determination is made that liability exists and the account is not paid,
then such service shall be disconnected.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Upon the return from active duty of a residential consumer who is a
service member, the city shall offer the residential consumer a period equal to
at least the period of the residential consumer's deployment on active duty to
pay any arrearages incurred during the period of the residential consumer's
deployment. The city shall inform the residential consumer that, if the period
the city offers presents a hardship to the consumer, the consumer may request a
longer period to pay the arrearages.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In order to be eligible for the benefits granted to service members
under this section, a service member must provide the city with a copy of the

the city only upon the condition that the charges or rates shall become a lien
upon the premises when the charges or rates become delinquent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A lien is created only if the city collector sends to the owner or
owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's
identification number, (i) a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person
who is delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notice sufficient to
inform the owner or owners of record, as referenced by the taxpayer's
identification number, that the charges or rates have become delinquent, and
(ii) a notice that unpaid charges or rates may create a lien upon the real
estate.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Notice of lien.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever a bill for public utility services becomes delinquent as
provided in section
86-24, and after the notice of delinquency is sent to the owner or owners of
record, the city collector shall file with the county recorder of deeds a
notice of lien claim. This notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting
out (1) a description of the real estate sufficient for the identification
thereof, (2) the amount of money due for such service, and (3) the date when
such amount became delinquent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The city collector shall send a copy of the notice of the lien to
the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the
taxpayer's identification number.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges
shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be
applied to pay the charges and attorneys fees, after deducting costs, as is the
case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill
in equity in the name of the city. The city attorney is hereby authorized and
directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the city in any court
having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill
becomes delinquent.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Legal action. The city also has the power from time to time to sue the
named customer, occupant or user of the premises in a civil action to recover
the money due for services rendered, plus collection fees, reasonable
attorney's fees and court costs. Whenever, a judgment is entered in as such
civil action, the foregoing provisions in this section with respect to filing
sworn statements of such delinquencies in the office of the recorder and
creating a lien against the real estate shall not be effective thereafter as to
charges or rates sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter against the real
estate for the delinquency. A judgment in such civil action operates as a
release and waiver of the lien for the amount of judgment.

Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Additional facilities: If the installation of a standard lighting
unit requires the installation by the city of facilities not required by the
city for distribution purposes other than private lighting, the city will
furnish, install, own and maintain the additional facilities (including wood
poles of the type established as standard for service hereunder) which may be
necessary to provide such lighting from nearby distribution lines. The city
will make a monthly charge, in addition to the charges set forth above, of 2.1
percent of the cost to the city of furnishing and installing such facilities.
In determining the amount of such monthly charge, the city may use unit prices
for such additional facilities as the cost base, provided that such unit prices
are at or below the city's average unit cost for such facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Ownership and maintenance of facilities: The city shall own and be
responsible for the maintenance of the city facilities installed to render the
service ordered by the customer, but the city shall not be required to remove
obstructions or trim trees that may interfere with proper distribution of light
from lighting units. The customer will be responsible for the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The removal of any obstruction to the installation of facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Provide any permits or easements required for their installation
and maintenance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Provide for access to them by the city trucks.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â If a customer desires installation of a lighting unit on a customer
owned pole, such pole must meet the city standards at the time of installation
and as long as the lighting unit remains in service.
Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Temporary service; deposit required:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A customer desiring temporary service of any kind shall be

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A customer requesting temporary service shall be responsible
for providing metering equipment permanently mounted to a wood pole or other
approved structure per the city's specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â As soon as possible after the proper application is received by
the city, an estimate of the costs of furnishing, installing and removing the
required facilities to provide for the temporary service shall be mailed to the
address, as supplied on the application form, of the party requesting the
service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A charge of $100.00 will be included in the estimate. Fifty
dollars of this said amount is nonrefundable. Fifty dollars of this said amount
will be held as a deposit to ensure the return of the revenue meter supplied by
the city. This deposit shall be returned to the customer upon return of the
meter in good working order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â If after reviewing the estimate supplied by the city, the
customer wishes to proceed with the installation of a temporary service, the
estimated cost figure provided by the city plus the fee described in the
paragraph above, shall be paid in advance by check made out to the city before
any work shall be performed by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â A temporary service shall not be installed until the city's

requests for service to new developments.
Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Electric service types and characteristics.
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Certain types of electrical service configurations are not available
in every location within the city's service territory. The type of service
which can be provided at any particular location will be determined by the city
based on one or more of the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Configuration of city's service lines available at that location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Available system capacity at that location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Voltage of available service lines at that location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Type, size and characteristics of load to be served at that location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The standard types of service and secondary utilization voltages for
loads which will be supplied within the city's service territory are as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Single-phase, three wire, 120/240 volt service
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Three-phase, four-wire WYE, 120/208 volt service
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Three-phase, four-wire WYE, 277/480 volt service
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Customers and potential customers whose installations may require
service voltages other than those normally available, as described in paragraph
b above, are requested to consult the superintendent to determine the
conditions under which such a type of service can be provided by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The voltage and characteristics of the city electric lines supplying
a customer's load shall be determined by the city on the basis of the size and
characteristics of the customer's load and its relation to the city's primary
or secondary service facilities located in or proposed for the area in which
the customer is to be served or is presently being served.
Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â All installation of electrical wires, apparatus and necessaries shall
be inspected by the superintendent, and shall be performed under the
superintendent's supervision, and after its completion the same shall also be
inspected by the superintendent. Any obstruction which may interfere with and
prevent a perfect inspection of wires carrying electrical current, such as
lath, plaster, boards and partitions, must be removed upon order of the
superintendent.
Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The director of public works and superintendent shall have full
management of the electric system and the inspection of all electrical work
within the city, inside of buildings and above, underneath and upon the surface
of streets and other real estate, in all electrical matters in which the city
is interested.
Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â All electrical wiring and installation of any house, building, office
or dwelling or other place within the city shall be under the direction of the
superintendent, in full and faithful accord and compliance with the latest
rules concerning the same adopted by National Electrical Code, the National
Electrical Safety Code and the American Insurance Association.
Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â No person but the superintendent shall attach to or make any
connections with any electrical wire with the purpose of procuring electrical
current therefrom. Any person so attaching and connecting to any such wire for
such purposes, without order from the superintendent and compliance with the
rules of this article, shall be prosecuted for theft.
Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â No claim for damages shall be made against the city by reason of the
breakage of any transformer, reducer, meter or wire carrying current; nor shall
the city be liable in damages to any customer deprived of electrical current by
reason of any breakage or any machinery or a stoppage for improvement or
repair; nor shall the city be liable for any loss, injury or damage resulting
from the interruption, restoration or reduction of electrical service from any
cause.
Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The superintendent shall have power to cut off and deprive a customer
of electric current when the superintendent is satisfied that the building and
place is not properly wired, or wired according to the rules, or for violation
of any of the rules hereby adopted, or for nonpayment of any rate, rental or
other charge, and shall not again attach such customer until all rules violated
have been fully complied with and all sums due for electric current and other
charges and demands due the city are fully paid. Disconnection for nonpayment
shall be pursuant to section
86-24.
Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â The superintendent shall have full power to trim any shade tree or
bush, remove any obstruction within the streets, alleys and public places of
the city which hinder or obstruct the wires or the free and efficient delivery
of the electric current to the several parts of the city.
Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The superintendent shall also have the right to order the removal of
any pole or post of any telegraph or telephone line which in any way impedes
the efficiency of the lines conveying electric current and power, and shall
take all other precautions necessary to prevent the electric current coming in
contact with wires of the lines other than the electric system, so that no harm
may occur to any person.
Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â The standard service voltage for all locations is 120/240 volts
single-phase, three-wire. Any other service voltage or three-phase service is
considered nonstandard.
Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Nonstandard service voltage; excess facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â There may exist locations where an existing distribution network has
other than standard secondary service voltage. Some of these nonstandard
voltages are 240 volts, three-phase, three-wire; 120/240 volts, three-phase,
four-wire; and 480 volts, three-phase, three-wire. These systems are not being
expanded, but in certain cases a new service may be installed at the existing
voltages in the existing network.
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â If a nonstandard service voltage or three-phase service is desired,
the owner shall consult with the superintendent before purchasing heavy duty
residential, commercial or industrial equipment for installation on the
electric system. If it is practical in the opinion of the superintendent, the
nonstandard service voltage may be provided; however, the owner shall bear the
additional expense, at the discretion of the city, of special distribution
transformers, and the risk of extended loss of service in the event of a
transformer failure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Should an existing customer wish to upgrade his or her electric
service beyond the standard service installation which is supplied by the city,
or should it be necessary to upgrade service to a customer because of increased
load or because customer's load is interfering with service to other city
customers, such necessary additional facilities shall be regarded as "excess
facilities."
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The customer shall be responsible for the costs of all facilities
installed on the customer's premises and for the city's out-of-pocket costs, as
required, to provide any facilities beyond the standard service facilities
normally provided by the city.
Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â The following types of customer service taps are provided by the city

of a buried triplex cable from pedestal, vault or pad mount transformer located
on or near the property line, to a point designated on the dwelling. The
location of the service entrance shall be such as to provide the shortest route
from the pedestal, vault or pad-mounted transformer to the house as may be
practical. All obstructions such as debris, dirt piles, brush and the like
shall be removed prior to the installation of service, and a lot shall be
graded to within one foot of final grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Underground service is not guaranteed by the electric utility as
circumstances may force service to be provided to any location by overhead
service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Underground tap-Overhead service area. Underground service in an
overhead service area will be available, provided engineering considerations
will not prohibit service, in the opinion of the superintendent. The conversion
of existing overhead service to underground service may be available, but only
on the availability of city personnel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Overhead service-Underground service area. Overhead service in an
underground service area will not be permitted unless, in the opinion of the
superintendent, due to engineering considerations this is the only feasible and
practical manner in which service may be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Meter sockets-All types of service area. All residential meter and
self contained meter sockets shall be provided by the customer. The transformer
rated meter socket shall be purchased by the customer from the city.

city's secondary distribution system and the customer's service entrance
equipment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Should a customer require a service entrance connection, whether
an initial connection or an upgraded connection, he or she shall be required to
fill out the necessary forms as required in this article.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â For a new service entrance connection, a fee shall be required in
advance at the time the application for electric service is submitted for the
city to provide the requested service connection. This fee may be included
along with the balance of the fees submitted prior to the award of a building
permit by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The fee schedule approved by the city council may be obtained at
city hall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Note 1: For services to residential apartment buildings or multi-
tenant commercial buildings, add $50.00 for each living unit within the
apartment building or tenant space within the commercial building beyond the
base unit, which is included in the basic residential service entrance
connection fee quoted above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Fees for residential service entrance connections exceeding 200 A
(single-phase) and general service customers exceeding 300 kVA in maximum
demand will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will be generally based
on the city's out-of-pocket costs.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â Under no circumstances shall an underground service connection
be provided which is to be covered by a deck, porch, walk or any other building
addition without the installation, by the customer, of a suitable duct through
which the customer may pull service conductors, provided by the city. See
subsection (17)g.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â The allowable total length of an overhead service drop beyond
what is considered standard will be determined by the city on the basis of the
conductor size required and on the characteristics of the pole from which the
service conductors originate. In no case will the length of the service drop
exceed 150 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â If an overhead service connection is longer than the allowable
length of a service drop and requires intermediate supports, the service drop
shall be considered the portion between the city's distribution facilities and
the first point of attachment on the customer's property. The remainder of the
service connection, including the first support on private property, shall be
furnished, installed, owned, and maintained by the city at the customer's
expense.

is within three percent of being correct, the fee will not be refunded and the
meter may be placed back in service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Meters stopped or registering inaccurately. Customer billing will be
based on estimated usage when meters are found stopped or registering
improperly. Such estimates will be based on comparable months' billings or
previous years' billings amended to the current rates and conditions when such
information is available.
Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â The following rules of service shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The superintendent shall deny or discontinue service to a customer
when in his or her opinion the wiring and equipment is unsafe, causes
unacceptable interference with the service of other customers or has
objectionable conditions. However, the city will cooperate with the customer in
order to determine the necessary remedial action for such conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The city reserves the right to inspect and test any equipment
connected to its system and to require that such equipment be provided with
nameplates showing the voltage, phase, full-load current, maximum current,
maximum kilo-volt amperes, and such other information as may be necessary to
determine the operating characteristics of the equipment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â All of a customer's lighting equipment, motor-driven equipment,
apparatus, and appliances shall have such characteristics or be equipped with
corrective devices so as to enable the city to maintain a satisfactory standard
of electric service. In the case of high motor starting current, violently
fluctuating or intermittent loads and the like, the city reserves and shall
have the right to require the customer to install, at the customer's expense,
transformers and apparatus to correct the objectionable conditions. These cases
may include welders, hoists, elevator motors, pumps, and similar apparatus.
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â When a separate or oversized substation or transformer must be
installed specifically to eliminate the effect of the objectionable load
condition, and the distribution system would otherwise have the capacity and
equipment required to supply a normal load service of the same size, or where
separate transformers and/or service are installed at the customer's request,
the substation or transformers are considered a corrective device under
subparagraph a. of this paragraph, and shall be provided at the customer's
expense, at the discretion of the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The city electrical rates for general service customers are based on
all such customers maintaining a power factor of not less than 85 percent
lagging. If a customer's power factor is less than 85 percent during periods of
normal operation, the city reserves the right to require the customer to
install, at his or her own expense, such corrective equipment as may be
required to increase such customer's power factor to not less than 85 percent
lagging.
Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â When a customer fails to install the necessary facilities on his or
her premises to correct the objectionable conditions of his or her load, or
fails to prevent such objectionable conditions from interfering with the city's
supply of satisfactory service to other customers, the city shall have the
right to deny service to the customer until the objectionable conditions shall
have been corrected in a manner satisfactory to the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Where corrective equipment is installed by the city on its
distribution system to correct any objectionable conditions, the customer whose
service caused the objectionable conditions shall be required to pay, at the
discretion of the city, without refund, the installed cost of such corrective
equipment, and the corrective equipment shall remain the property of the city.
In lieu of such payment, and subject to approval by the city, a customer may
elect to pay a monthly charge equal to 1.5 percent of the installed cost of
such corrective equipment installed by the city.
Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Changes to existing electric service facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Should it become necessary, strictly in the interest of the city, to
change the voltage or characteristics (i.e. change from overhead to underground
type) of lines entering the property of an existing customer, the city shall
bear the costs associated with modifying or replacing the city's existing
facilities, as necessary, to provide the same level and type of electric
service as was available prior to the date of the required change.
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Any changes which are required to the electric service entrance
facilities of the customer to accommodate the revised or upgraded city electric
service facilities will be made by the customer at no cost to the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The city shall retain sole responsibility for deciding to change the
voltage or the characteristics of the lines entering the property of an
existing customer for any reason which is determined, by the city, to be in the
best interest of the city and its customers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â If, because of public improvements such as street widening, grading,
excavating or other reasons beyond the city's control, the city must move
facilities with which it serves the customer, the city, as a condition of
continued service, may require that a new service connection be established
under the same terms as an original service connection from the standpoint of
city and customer's expense and installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â If the city determines that a change in the voltage or
characteristics of the lines entering an existing customer's facility are
necessary, the city will:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Notify the customer of this fact in writing;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Furnish an estimate of the charges which will be incurred by the
customer due to the necessary improvement. The cost estimate will be prepared
based on information which is available to the city at the time and will be
based upon the most economical service plan consistent with good engineering
and operating practice, as determined by the city, and in accordance with all
applicable codes and regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â As a condition for continuing to receive electric service from the
city, the customer must advance the estimated cost of the required improvement
by the city. The customer must also make all of the necessary arrangements and
fund any improvements which are required on the customer's service entrance
equipment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Should a customer desire to install a deck, porch, walk or any other
building addition above an existing underground service connection, the
customer shall choose to follow one of the following two options:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The customer may apply for an upgraded service connection to be
installed at the present location but which will include a duct installation as
described under subsection (14)f.16. above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The customer may apply for an upgraded service connection to be
installed in a different location not affected by the proposed building
addition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Should a customer desire to install a pool or other structure
beneath an existing overhead service connection, the customer shall apply for
an upgraded service location which will not be affected by the proposed
additions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â For customers requiring modifications to their existing overhead or
underground electric service entrance facilities as per subparagraphs g or h

Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Electrical energy provided by the electric system shall not be sold
to a third party or otherwise disposed of by a third party. The energy provided
by the electric system shall be for the sole use of its customers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â When a customer elects to upgrade the existing electrical facilities
in an existing multiple occupancy premise, the installation of the upgraded
facilities shall have to conform to the requirement established by this
paragraph as well as this article.
Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â Motors and electrical apparatus used by customers on the electric
system shall comply with the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The city reserves the right to select the type of service to be
supplied, and shall be consulted before the equipment is purchased or ordered
by a customer, regarding the general characteristics of service, including
those services having five hp and larger or where the aggregate load of smaller
motors is more than seven and one-half horsepower (hp).
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â In general, seven and one-half hp and larger motors will be three-
phase, and motors smaller than seven and one-half hp may be single-phase. There
may be, at the city's sole discretion, exceptions to this rule, as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In outlying and residential areas where three-phase energy is not
readily available, larger single-phase motors may be permitted, but only with
prior approval of the superintendent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Where the customer is already using three-phase energy, motors
smaller than seven and one-half hp may be added to the three-phase service,
upon notification to the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Three-phase service is not normally available for residential
customers and is considered nonstandard service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Motor and motorized equipment will generally be approved for use on
the electric system only if the total locked rotor current does not exceed an
acceptable level, as determined by the superintendent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Whenever, in the judgment of the city, a motor starting current is
of a magnitude to cause interference to other customers, the customer shall be
required to provide a starting device of a type which will eliminate such
interference.
Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Manually-operated reduced voltage starting devices shall be so
constructed that they cannot be placed in the running position before passing
through the starting position.
Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Application of reduced voltage starting and the application of
under-voltage release starting equipment are recommended for all motors seven
and one-half horsepower or larger. The under-voltage release shall be of a type
that will return the starting device to the off position when the electric
supply is interrupted.
Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â Rented private lighting luminaires (dusk-to-dawn lights or security
lights) for homes, schools, security, churches, commercial areas, and industry
shall be provided where feasible and in keeping with good electrical practice
upon request, as per the following specifications:
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A self-contained automatic dusk-to-dawn 175-watt mercury vapor
lighting fixture shall be furnished and installed, or caused to be installed,
by the city, such fixture to meet standards and specifications of the city, on
existing wood pole structures. The city will be responsible for making the
installation, furnishing the electricity for the operation of the lamp,
providing all the necessary maintenance (including the replacement of lamps,
but excluding malicious damage) for the length of service, as agreed to by the
city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Dusk-to-dawn lights shall be installed on wood poles with a normal
ground-to-lamp height of approximately 25 feet. Should a customer desire his or
her lighting on steel, aluminum, concrete, decorative-type poles and/or
underground cable installation, the city may, at its discretion, install or
cause the special service to be installed. The customer shall bear the total
cost that is above that of a normal wood pole installation, and the additional
charge shall be payable by the customer prior to installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The customer shall have the responsibility to notify the city of any
interruption of service of the dusk-to-dawn lights. The city will restore
service only during regularly scheduled working hours and shall, in any event,
be under no obligation to do so before 72 hours from the time of notification.
If the city is unable to effect repairs not caused by the customer within this
period, the city's only responsibility will be to abate the charges on a pro-
rata basis for each day after 72 hours in which service is not available. The
customer shall remove any obstruction to the installation of the city-owned
facilities.
Â Â Â (21)Â Â Â Extensions of electric service facilities.

Sec. 86-169. Additional rules and regulations.
In addition to the rules, regulations and laws elsewhere set out in this
article, and in addition to state and federal rules, regulations and laws, the
following rules, regulations and laws are hereby adopted for the control,
management, government and operation of the sewer system of the city:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All residence or service sewers connecting with the sewers of the
city shall be laid upon the grade and according to the specifications and
directions, not herein enumerated, as shall be given by the superintendent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All wearing surfaces, tongues, curves, etc., in manholes or other
places shall be plastered over with Portland cement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All sewers shall be laid with cement joints and practically
watertight to prevent matter and sewerage from contaminating the ground.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â All sewer pipe shall be laid to a perfectly straight line and

pipe not less than six inches in diameter, with a fall of not less than one
foot in each 100 feet of length. It shall be laid to a true line and grade, and
all joints cemented perfectly, and a sack completely filling the sewer shall be
drawn through the pipes as they are laid, care being taken to avoid disturbing
them.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The house connections shall stop four feet from the house wall, and
there be connected to a four- or six-inch soil pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â When streets or alleys are to be paved, the connections shall be
laid to the curbline of all properties abutting thereon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â All piping used in the house or building shall be of PVC or any
other state or federally approved material.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â All fixtures should be trapped and vented, and the vent should
extend at least 18 inches above the roof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â No vertical soil or vent pipe shall be trapped.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Each fixture shall be separately trapped to prevent siphonage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â No refrigerator or provision receptacle shall be connected
directly with the sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â Water closets shall be flushed from tanks, and not by direct
connection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â Pipes shall be easy of access for inspection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Grease traps shall be provided for sinks and all places where
considerable greasy matter will be discharged.

vent pipes shall not be less than two inches in diameter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â No person but a licensed or qualified plumber shall do any
plumbing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â Any street, alley, ditch, drain, pipe, walk or pavement which is
disturbed or in any manner interfered with by reason of laying or constructing
any sewer or connection therewith, shall upon completion of the work be
replaced in as near the same condition as it was prior thereto; and all holes,
excavations, ditches or dangerous places caused by construction of any work
mentioned in this section shall be protected at all times, both day and night,
so that no injury may occur to any person or animal by reason thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (21)Â Â Â All new or repaired residence or service sewers connecting to the
sewers of the city shall have tracer wire installed with the sewer line. The
wire shall be #12 AWG THHN or THWN and all splices shall have watertight
connectors (grease filled) for direct burial.
(Code 1976, Â§ 12-213; Ord. No. 09-21, Â§ 2, 10-12-09)
Sec. 86-170. Use of public sewers.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated
cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as prohibited by subsection (b)(2), all other unpolluted
drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as
combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the city
council's committee on water and sewers. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted
process waters may be discharged on approval of the superintendent, to a storm
sewer, combined sewer, or natural outlet.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it shall appear likely in
the opinion of the superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewer,
sewage treatment process or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers; materials of
construction of the sewers; nature of the sewage; degree of treatability of
wastes in the sewage treatment plant; and maximum limits established by
regulatory agencies. The substances prohibited are:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â Materials which exert or cause:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye
wastes and vegetable tanning solutions);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements
in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Unusual volume of flow or concentrations of wastes
constituting slugs as defined in this article.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharges to the receiving waters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (4) or which are in violation of
the standards for pretreatment provided in 40 CFR 403, June 26, 1978, and any
amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the superintendent may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the superintendent may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Reject the wastes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing traces or sewer cages, under the provisions
of subsection (11).
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be so
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and,
when required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this division and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but no less than once per year. The
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and local standards
are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and
laboratory analyses to the city at such times and in such a manner as
prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements,
analyses, and reporting required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary
the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
outside laboratory service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of
Laboratories Manual of Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control
manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with section
86-186, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance
with federal and state guidelines for user charge system.

division. The superintendent or his representative shall have no authority to
inquire into any processes, including metallurgical, chemical, oil refining,
ceramic, paper, or other industries, beyond that point having a direct bearing
on the kind and source of discharge to the sewer or waterway or facilities for
waste treatment.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in subsection (a) of this section, the superintendent or duly authorized
employees of the city, the state environmental protection agency, and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency shall observe all safety rules applicable to
the premises established by the company, and the company shall be held harmless
for injury or death to the city employees, and the city shall indemnify the
company against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property
damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling
operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company
to maintain conditions as required in section
86-170(9).
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The superintendent and other fully authorized employees of the city
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all

DIVISION 3. WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
Sec. 86-186. Generally.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge
for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the
city shall consist of a basic user charge, a debt service charge, a capital
improvement charge and applicable surcharges.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The basic user charge is levied on all users to recover the operation,
maintenance and replacement (O, M & R) costs and shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic concentrations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A five-day, 20-degree Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 300 mg/
l; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â A suspended solids content of 390 mg/l.
Â Â Â Â Â Â The basic user charge shall be computed as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Estimate the annual wastewater volume, pounds of BOD and pounds of
SS to be treated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Proportion the estimated O, M & R costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, BOD and SS.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Proportion the estimated O, M & R costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, BOD and SS.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal domestic strength
sewage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Compute surcharge costs per pound for BOD and SS concentrations in
excess of normal domestic strengths.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The debt service charge is computed by apportioning the annual debt
service as a charge per 1,000 gallons.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The capital improvement charge is levied on sewers to provide for
capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage treatment
works. The capital improvement charge is computed by apportioning the annual
amount to be accrued as a charge per 1,000 gallons.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
domestic concentrations of 300 mg/l BOD and 390 mg/l SS. The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the 300 mg/l and 390 mg/l concentrations for BOD and SS,
respectively.
The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be established
by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as may be deemed
necessary by the superintendent and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or O, M & R costs.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â The users of the wastewater treatment services will be notified
annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of
the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater operation,
maintenance and replacement.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be the metered or spent water consumption read to
the lowest even increments of 100 gallons.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of his water from sources other than the city's water system,
all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the
superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
these other sources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the superintendent.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Basic user charge: There shall be and there is hereby established a
basic user charge of $2.40 per 1,000 gallons per month of metered water
consumption to be applied to all users to recover O, M & R costs. Commencing
with the first billing date for each user after July 1 of each year, there
shall be a five percent increase to the basic user charge in effect prior to
the increase.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Debt service charge. There shall be and there is hereby established a
debt service charge of $0.73 per 1,000 gallons per month, to each user of the
wastewater facility. All users outside the corporate limits of the city shall
have an additional $10.00 per month per meter charge added to their debt
service charge.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Capital improvement charge. There shall be and there is hereby
established a capital improvement charge of $0.36 per 1,000 gallons per month
to each user of the wastewater facility.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Rates. A minimum charge per month shall be applied to all users whose
water consumption does not exceed 2,000 gallons per month. This minimum charge
shall consist of two multiplied by the total of the basic user charge per 1,000
gallons per month plus the debt service charge per 1,000 gallons per month plus
the capital improvement charge per 1,000 gallons per month. The minimum charge
for multifamily dwellings or multi-user units, which are not connected and
metered separately, shall be the minimum charge per month as calculated in the
foregoing sentence times the number of dwellings or units connected to the
single line per month.
Â Â Â (m)Â Â Â All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater facilities shall
pay a flat rate charge of $12.40 per month. The flat rate charge consists of
$6.48 for O, M & R costs, $4.48 for debt service costs and $1.44 for capital
improvement costs. The flat rate charge will allow a maximum of 4,000 gallons
per month. In the event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by the
superintendent to be in excess of 4,000 gallons per month, the superintendent
may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the water supply
or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied.
Â Â Â (n)Â Â Â Surcharge rates. The rates of surcharges for BOD and SS shall be as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Per pound of BOD$0.12
Â Â Â Â Â Â Per pound of SS0.14
Â Â Â (o)Â Â Â Computation of wastewater service charge. The wastewater service
charge shall be computed by the following formula:
Â Â Â Â Â Â CW = CC + CD = CM + (Vu-X) CU + CS

ARTICLE VI. IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
Sec. 86-210. Purpose.
The purpose of this identity theft prevention program is to protect customers
of the city's utility services from identity theft. The program is intended to
establish reasonable policies and procedures to facilitate the detection,
prevention and mitigation of identity theft in connection with the opening of
new covered accounts and activity on existing covered accounts. This identity
theft prevention program is adopted pursuant to and in compliance with the
Identity Theft Rules of the Federal Trade Commission, Part 681 of Title 16 of
the Code of Federal Regulations (16 CFR Part 681).
(Ord. No. 08-23, Â§ 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, Â§ 1, 1-23-12)
Sec. 86-211. Scope.
This program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying
information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the city
by any and all personnel of the city, including management personnel. This
program does not replace or repeal any previously existing policies or programs
addressing some or all of the activities that are the subject of this program,
but rather it is intended to supplement any such existing policies and
programs.
(Ord. No. 08-23, Â§ 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, Â§ 1, 1-23-12)

offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that
involves or is designed to permit multiple payments of transactions. (16 CFR
681.2(b)(3)(i)). A utility account is a "covered account." The term "covered
account" also includes other accounts offered or maintained by the city for
which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers of the city or its
customers from identity theft. (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(ii)).
Â Â Â Identity theft: The term "identity theft" means a fraud committed or
attempted using the identifying information of another person without
authority. (16 CFR Â§ 681.2(b)(8) and 16 CFR Â§ 603.2(a)).
Â Â Â Identifying information: The term "identifying information" means any name
or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information,
to identify a specific person, including any name, social security number, date
of birth, official state or government issued driver's license or
identification number, alien registration number, government passport number,
employer or taxpayer identification number. Additional examples of "identifying
information" are set forth in 16 CFR Â§ 603.2(a).
Â Â Â Program: The term "program" means this Identity Theft Prevention Program.
Â Â Â Program administrator: The term "program administrator" means the Director
of Public Works of this city.
Â Â Â Red flag: The term "red flag" means a pattern, practice or specific activity

Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the Federal Trade Commission's Identity Theft Rules (16 CFR
Part 681) or the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681 et seq.),
as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (Public Law
108-159).
(Ord. No. 08-23, Â§ 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, Â§ 1, 1-23-12)
Sec. 86-213. Administration of the program.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The initial adoption and approval of the Identity Theft Prevention
Program shall be by the adoption of this program by the city council.
Thereafter, changes to the program of a day-to-day operational character and
decisions relating to the interpretation and implementation of the program may
be made by the program administrator. Major changes or shifts of policy
positions under the program shall only be made by the city council.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the
program will be the responsibility of the program administrator. The program
administrator may, but shall not be required to, appoint a committee to
administer the Program. The program administrator shall be the head of any such
committee. The program administrator shall report at least annually to the city
council regarding compliance with this program.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Issues to be addressed in the annual identity theft prevention report
include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts
and activity with respect to existing covered accounts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Service provider arrangements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's

improvement.
(Ord. No. 08-23, Â§ 1, 10-13-08; Ord. No. 12-1, Â§ 1, 1-23-12)
Sec. 86-214. Identity theft prevention elements.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Identification of relevant red flags. The city has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the Federal
Trade Commission's Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the city's past
history with instances of identity theft, if any. The city hereby determines
that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this program
given the relative size of the city and the limited nature and scope of the
services that the city provides to its citizens:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The presentation of suspicious documents.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered
or forged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the city, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the city. For example:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The address does not match any address in the consumer report
or credit reporting agency ID check response; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The social security number has not been issued, or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's death master file.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the Social
Security Number range and date of birth.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the city. For example:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The phone number on an application is the same as the number
provided on a fraudulent application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the city. For example:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The social security number provided is the same as that submitted
by other persons opening an account or other customers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â If the city uses challenge questions, the person opening the
covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the city receives a request for the addition of authorized users on
the account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known fraud patterns. For example: the customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although usage of utility products or services continues in connection with the
customer's covered account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The city is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The city is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products or
services in connection with a customer's covered account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Notice of possible identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The city is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a
law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers (if such agencies or providers are used
by the city):
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report
or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in
response to a request for a consumer report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in Â§681.1(b) of the Federal Trade Commission's Identity
Theft Rules.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Detection of red flags.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The employees of the city that interact directly with customers on
a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for monitoring the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and the
modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that all employees who might
be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such
that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in
this program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to
recognize the red flags identified in this program shall not open a new account
for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer
with access to information in an existing account without the direct
supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant
red flags identified in this program and exercise sound judgment in connection
with the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in
connection with the opening of a new account or with modifying or accessing of
an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for making the
final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The program administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally
consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program rules (31 CFR
103.121) implementing Section 326(a) of the USA Patriot Act but need not be as
detailed. The program administrator may, but is not required to, maintain a
relationship with a credit reporting agency to perform identity verification
services. The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written
policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Response to detected red flags.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the responsible employees of the city as set forth in the
previous subsection are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a
reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to
open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account based on
the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider, the city shall not open the new account or modify or
otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be.
Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or the modification or
access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the city and
shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The program administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security
incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a
notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent
individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity
theft when a red flag is detected include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Contacting the customer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices
that permit access to a covered account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Not opening a new covered account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Closing an existing covered account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a
covered account to a debt collector.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Notifying law enforcement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.

Sec. 86-215. Program management and accountability.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Initial risk assessmentâCovered accounts. Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the Federal Trade Commission's Identity
Theft Rules. Therefore, the city determines that with respect to its
residential utility accounts it offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The
city also performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility
offers or maintains any other accounts for which there are reasonably
foreseeable risks to customers or the utility from identity theft. In making
this determination the city considered (1) the methods it uses to open its
accounts, (2) the methods it uses to access its accounts, and (3) its previous
experience with identity theft, and it concluded that it does not offer or
maintain any such other covered accounts.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Program updatesâRisk assessment. The program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
program update include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Changes in methods of identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Training and oversight.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All staff and third-party service providers performing any activity
in connection with one or more covered accounts are to be provided appropriate
training and receive effective oversight to ensure that the activity is
conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed to detect,
prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.

State law reference(s)â65 ILCS 5/11-20-6.
Sec. 90-46. Lien.
Charges for the removal of the nuisance by the city shall be a lien upon the
real estate affected, superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except tax
liens; provided that within one year after such cost and expense is incurred,
the city or person performing the service by authority of the city, in his or
its own name, files notice of lien in the office of the recorder in the county
or in the office of the registrar of titles of the county if the real estate
affected is registered under the Torrens system. The notice shall consist of a
sworn statement setting out:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A description of the real estate sufficient for identification
thereof;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The amount of money representing the removal cost and expense
incurred or payable for the service; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The date or dates when the removal cost was incurred by the city.
However, the lien of the city shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose
rights in and to such real estate have arisen subsequent to the weed cutting
and prior to the filing of such notice, and the lien of the city shall not be
valid as to any mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lienor whose rights in
and to such real estate arise prior to the filing of such notice. Upon payment
of the cost and expense by the owner of or persons interested in such property
after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the city or
person in whose name the lien has been filed and the release may be filed of
record as in the case of the filing of the notice of lien.
The cost of the removal shall not be a lien on the real estate affected unless
a notice is personally served on, or sent by certified mail to, the person to
whom was sent the tax bill for the general taxes on the property for the last
preceding year. The notice shall be delivered or sent after the cutting of
weeds on the property. The notice shall state the substance of Section 11-20-
7 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-20-7) and the substance of this
section and shall identify the property, by common description, and the
location of the weeds to be cut.

(Ord. No. 21-15 , Â§ 1, 10-11-21)
Sec. 90-47. Foreclosure of lien.
Property subject to a lien for unpaid weed cutting charges shall be sold for
nonpayment of such charges and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to
pay the charges after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be in equity in the name of the city.
The city attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such
proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court having jurisdiction over
such matter, against any property for which such bill for weed cutting is
unpaid.

ARTICLE IV. AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS
Section 4.1. Purpose of the agricultural district.
The primary purpose of the agricultural district is to allow areas within the
corporate limits of the city to be retained in agriculture use in order to
prevent scattered nonfarm growth; preserve woodlands and wildlife areas, and
retain open space in its natural state. The requirements of the district are
designed so as to prevent unwarranted premature urban development from
encroaching upon legitimate agricultural areas, thus disrupting the agriculture
resources, environment, and economy. It is essential that development in areas
which are predominately agricultural be based on sound principles which realize
the importance of such activities to the economy and welfare of the city.
Dwellings that are not farm dwellings are prohibited in the agricultural
district.

permitted as new uses under the provisions of this ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Discourage any land use which would generate traffic on minor local
streets other than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Discourage any use which, because of its character or size, would
create requirements and costs for public services, such as fire and police
protection, water supply and sewerage, substantially in excess of such
requirements and costs if the district were developed solely for one-family
dwellings.

ARTICLE VI. BUSINESS DISTRICTS
Section 6.1. Purpose of the business districts.
The primary purpose of the business districts is that they be located to serve
commercial concerns efficiently and to minimize any negative impact on less
intense uses such as residences and agriculture. For this purpose, business
uses are allowed greater density. For business districts, more than one (1)
principal use may be allowed in a single building without zoning board of
appeals approval if the uses are permitted by the right in the district.
The B-1 neighborhood business district is intended to provide commercial areas
of limited size, for basic trade and personal services for the convenience of
adjacent residential areas, for needs recurring regularly or frequently.
The B-2 general shopping district is intended to provide areas for a range of
commercial uses wider than that of neighborhood business but at a lower
intensity than the regional shopping, meeting the general business needs of the
city.
The B-3 regional shopping district's primary purpose is to provide for retail,
service, office and commercial uses of regional importance. It is intended to
provide the zoning and capital improvements which attract a level of
development capable of generating a significant number of jobs. Establishments
in this district may range in size from free-standing one-user buildings to
regional shopping malls. Such businesses generate high levels of traffic and
consequently require a significant investment in public infrastructure.

Section 6.15. Downtown business district.
Â Â Â The traditional commercial faÃ§ade can be considered the most important
element that gives historical significance to the downtown. Most of the
buildings in the downtown business district were built between 1880 and 1910.
When originally constructed, downtown buildings shared a consistency in design
and proportion that was a key element in the unifying of the district. To
maintain this unifying element, new construction and rehabilitation of existing
buildings will follow the points below:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Store fronts will provide an entrance to the business and have large
display windows. Storefronts (first floor) shall be composed almost entirely of
windows. Traditional faÃ§ade calls for more glass and less wall space, balanced
with less window space and more masonry at the second and third floor levels.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The faÃ§ade will consist of masonry with regularly spaced windows.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â There will be a decorative cornice which caps the building.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Materials not be applied to the storefront include imitation brick,
rough textured wood siding, wooden shingles on mansard roofs, gravel and/or
stucco materials.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Canvas awnings are approved on traditional storefront buildings. At a
minimum, awnings should be seven feet above grade.

ARTICLE X. STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL USES
Section 10.1. Special uses.
A special use is one which is potentially appropriate in and compatible with
other uses in its zoning district, but which, because of the potential impact
on the district necessitates close examination, site plan review, and
individual regulation. Special uses are not permitted by right in the various
zoning districts; a valid special use permit, authorized by the city council in
accordance with the procedures stipulated herein, is required before
application for a building permit or for a certificate of occupancy for a
special use.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 10.2. Special use permit procedures.
Â Â Â The standards and procedures for the consideration of mobile home parks are
specified in the city's
Chapter 53 - Mobile Homes Code. All other special uses designated in
Table One of this article are subject to the procedures and standards
stipulated herein.
The zoning officer shall not issue a special use permit unless and until the
following procedure has been completed: A written application for a special use
permit shall be submitted to the zoning officer by the owners of record of the
property involved. The application shall demonstrate:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort, or general welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
or substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â That the establishment of the special use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide access
so designed as to minimize traffic congestions in the public street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â That the establishment, maintenance and operation of the special
use will be in conformance with the purpose to the regulations of the district
in which the special use is to be located, except as such regulations may, in
each instance, be modified by the city council pursuant to the recommendations
of the zoning commission.
After an application for a permit has been made the zoning commission shall
hold a duly advertised public hearing as prescribed by statute and make a
recommendation to grant or deny the special use within sixty (60) days of
filing of the complete application. The notice of hearing shall contain the
address or location of the property for which the special use is requested as
well as the nature of the special use. A nonrefundable one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) fee shall be paid to partially defer the cost of the of the
public hearing involving the special use. The applicant shall pay the sum to
the city treasurer at the time of filing for the permit.
The zoning commission recommendation must be based on a finding of fact
determined from the evidence presented at the hearing. In making its
recommendation, the zoning commission may also recommend such additional
conditions and requirements as are appropriate or necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare and to carry out the purpose of this
ordinance. Recommendations including but not limited to the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Regulate the location, extent, and intensity of such uses;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Require adherence to an approved site plan;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Require landscaping and the screening of such uses by means of
fences, walls, or vegetation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Stipulate required minimum lot sizes, minimum yards, and maximum
height of buildings and structures;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Regulate vehicular access and volume, and the design and location
of parking and loading areas and structures;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Require conformance to health, safety, and sanitation requirements,
as necessary;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Regulate signs and outdoor lighting; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Any other conditions deemed necessary to effect the purposes of
this ordinance.
The city council shall, by ordinance, make the decision to grant or deny a
special use permit within sixty (60) days of receiving the zoning commission
recommendation. The city council may impose any conditions or requirements,
including but not limited to those recommended by the zoning commission, which
it deems appropriate or necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare and to carry out the purpose of this ordinance. In addition, any
proposed special use which fails to receive the positive approval of the zoning
commission shall not be approved by the city council except by a two-thirds (?)
vote of the city council members then holding office.
A special use authorized by a special use permit is subject to all the
development regulations applicable to permitted uses in the district in which
it is located, unless other regulations are specifically stated in the special
use permit. Special uses are also subject to applicable development regulations
specified in
Table One: Table of Additional Conditions for Specific Special Uses.Â 
Unless otherwise specifically provided in the terms of the special use permit,
the permit shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of its
issuance. A valid special use permit is required in order to apply for a
building permit, or for a certificate of occupancy if no building permits is
required to establish a use; once established, however, the special use may
continue indefinitely beyond the expiration of the permit allowing it, unless
otherwise specifically provided in the terms of the permit.
Violation of the terms and conditions of the special use permit shall be deemed
a violation of this ordinance. Extensions of any time period, or changes in the
development schedule or other time sequence which were approved as part of the
special use permit may be approved only by the city council; any such extension
or change which is not so authorized shall be deemed a violation of this
ordinance.
(Ord. No. 05-16, Â§ 2, 7-11-05; Ord. No. 10-3, Â§Â§ 1, 15, 3-26-10; Ord. No. 2023-
O-02, Â§ 1, 1-9-23)
Section 10.3. Standards for specific special uses.
All special uses listed in Table One: Table of Additional Conditions for
Specific Special Uses shall comply with the development standards contained
therein, unless otherwise specially provided in the permit authorized specially
by the city council; such uses shall also comply with all applicable parking
regulations, and development regulations stated for the district and use in
question, unless otherwise provided for in the permit.

reconstructed or altered beyond the limitations herein provided by the action
of the zoning board of appeals, after public hearing, as required by law in
case of variations. The limitations herein provided shall not prohibit the
restoration to a safe condition of any structure or portion thereof declared
unsafe by a proper authority.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If a nonconforming use has ceased for a period of one (1) year or

building designed, arranged, and intended for such use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Once changed to a conforming use, no fence shall be permitted to
revert to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be substituted or
added to another nonconforming use.
Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Conflicting requirements. Any requirement or specification regulating
fences that is contained in another section of the Code of Ordinances that is
in conflict with a provision of this section shall take precedence over this
section, but only to the extent of the conflict.

(20) feet of any street intersection. At intersections where traffic control
devices are installed the requirement may be increased as necessary to prevent
hazards. Parking area access ways (including residential driveways) shall
intersect at right angles to the primary public street serving that property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â No certificate of occupancy will be issued upon completion of any
building or repair operations unless and until all off-street parking
requirements, shown upon the plans, or made a part of the building permit,

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purpose. Off-street loading shall be provided which is adequate for
the use located on the zoning lot. Off-street loading facilities shall be
provided to allow adequate ingress and egress to establishments, buildings,
structures, or uses upon each zoning lot in a manner which will not interfere
with the movement of vehicular traffic to and from the zoning lot or adjacent
public streets and ways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Access. Each off-street loading space shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movements upon the zoning lot and the street
or alley. All such access ways shall be not less than twelve (12) feet in
width.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Buffer strips. Off-street loading spaces for vehicles over two (2)
tons capacity shall not be closer than fifty (50) feet to any property in a
residential district unless such loading space is completely enclosed by a
building, walls, a solid fence, or a foliage buffer not less than ten (10) feet
in height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Location of off-street loading spaces. All loading spaces, whether
permitted or required, shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use
served, shall not be located within fifty (50) feet of the intersection of any
two (2) streets, and shall not be located within required front yards for the
zoning lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Loading facility not to be used for parking. Space allocated to any
off-street parking loading berth shall not, while so allocated, be used to
satisfy any space requirements for off-street parking facilities on the zoning
lot or portions thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Size. Unless otherwise specified, a required loading space shall be
at least fourteen (14) feet in width by fifty (50) feet in length, and shall
have a vertical clearance of not less than fourteen (14) feet, or such greater
size as may be needed to accommodate vehicles so that no vehicle loading or
unloading overhangs into the public right-of-way or interferes with internal
circulation upon the zoning lot. Reasonably adequate turning and maneuvering
space shall be provided in addition to the minimum sized loading space
requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Surfacing. Loading areas in all districts and uses including
driveways, shall be paved, and loading areas shall be properly graded for
drainage, maintained in good condition, and improved with:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A 1.5" Surface Course; Mix C, Class 1, Type 2; 2.5" Binder

Woven or nonwoven pavement fabric.
In any application or use where traffic loading warrants additional paving
thickness, the city engineer may require submission of a pavement design for
the loading areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Loading spaces required. Off-street loading facilities shall be
provided on the basis of gross floor area of the establishment, building,
structure, or use which is subject to the requirement for such off-street
loading and shall be provided at a ratio of one (1) loading space for the first
ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area per building with one (1)
additional loading space at the rate of one (1) space for each additional
fourteen thousand (14,000) square feet of gross floor area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Joint off-street loading. See section
13.11(5).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â No certificate of occupancy will be issued upon completion of any
building or repair operations unless and until all off-street loading
requirements, shown upon the plans, or made a part of the building permit,
shall be in place and ready for use.

Section 13.14. Existing parking and existing loading facilities.
Any establishment that does not provide the minimum number of parking and
loading spaces required by this article shall not be allowed to further reduce

nonconforming area.
When the existing use of a structure is damaged or destroyed by means other
than usual deterioration, the structure may be repaired or rebuilt. Parking and
loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored, but additional parking and loading facilities

Whenever the use of any structure or premises is substantially altered, spaces
shall be provided to satisfy the requirements of this article.

ARTICLE XIV. NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
Section 14.1. Intent.
It is the intent of this ordinance to regulate existing, legal nonconforming
lots, structures, or uses until they are removed and not to encourage their
survival.
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this
ordinance and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and use of land and
structures which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance
or future amendments.
Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses
in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that non-
conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.2. Nonconforming lots.
In any one-family residential district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record which is under
separate and distinct ownership from adjacent lots at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to
the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement
variances may be sought through approval of the zoning board of appeals.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.3. Nonconforming uses of land.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, lawful
use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this
ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for this district in
which such land is located.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.4. Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than fifty (50) per cent of its current market value, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
Excluded from the provisions of this sub-paragraph are accessory buildings with
a nonconformity being the set-back from a side or rear lot line as long as the
nonconformity is not increased in the reconstruction and the reconstruction
occurs within ninety (90) days of the destruction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is removed.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 14.5. Nonconforming uses of structures and land.
If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that
would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification provided that
the zoning board of appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in
the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the zoning board of appeals may require conditions and
safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this ordinance. Where a
nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in combination is
hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed
to a less conforming use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.

ARTICLE XV. TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND FACILITIES
Section 15.1. Findings.
The Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996
("the Act") grants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exclusive
jurisdiction over:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF)
emissions from telecommunications facilities; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The regulation of radio signal interference among users of the RF
spectrum. The city's regulation of towers and telecommunications facilities in
the city will not have the effect of prohibiting any person from providing
wireless telecommunications services in violation of the Act.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 15.2. Purposes.
The general purpose of this article is to regulate the placement, construction,
and modification of towers and telecommunications facilities in order to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time
not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless
telecommunications marketplace in the city.
Specifically, the purposes of this article are:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â To regulate the location of towers and telecommunications
facilities in the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of towers and telecommunications facilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â To minimize adverse visual impact of towers and telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower structures
to support antenna and telecommunications facilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and
telecommunications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â To ensure that towers and telecommunications facilities are
compatible with surrounding land uses.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)

collocation, and the result of such attempts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The zoning officer may require the application to be reviewed
by an independent engineer under contract to the city to determine whether the
antenna study supports the basis for the modification requested. The cost of
review by the city's engineer shall be reimbursed to the city by the applicant.

adverse impacts, if any, created by the modification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In addition, the board may include conditions on the site
where the tower is to be located if such conditions are necessary to preserve
the character and integrity of the neighborhoods affected by the proposed tower
and mitigate any adverse impacts which arise in connection with the approval of
the modification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In addition to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section,
in the following cases, the applicant must also demonstrate, with written
evidence, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â In the case of a requested modification to the setback
requirement, section

which the tower is proposed to be located and the alternative for the person is
to locate the tower at another site which is closer in proximity to a
residentially zoned land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â In the case of a request for modification to the separation and
buffer requirements from other towers of section
15.7, "Separation or buffer requirements," that the proposed site is zoned
"industrial" and the proposed site is at least double the minimum standard for
separation from residentially zoned lands as provided in section
15.7.

wireless communications system and if the person is willing to create approved
landscaping and other buffers to screen the tower from being visible to
residentially zoned property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â In the case of a request for modification of the height limit
for towers and telecommunications facilities or to the minimum height
requirements for antenna support structures, that the modification is necessary
to: (i) facilitate collocation of telecommunications facilities in order to
avoid construction of a new tower; or (ii) to meet the coverage requirements of
the applicant's wireless communications system, which requirements must be
documented with written, technical evidence from an engineer(s) that
demonstrates that the height of the proposed tower is the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily, and no tower that is taller than such
minimum height shall be approved.

Section 15.19. Abandonment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If any antenna/tower shall ceased to be used for a period of three
hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days, the city council shall notify the
owner, with a copy to the applicant, that the site will be subject to a
determination by the city council that such site has been abandoned. The owner
shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of said notice to show, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the tower has been in use or under repair
during the period. If the owner fails to show that the antenna/tower has been
in use or under repair during the period, the city council shall issue a final
determination of abandonment for the site. Upon issuance of the final
determination of abandonment, the owner shall, within seventy-five (75) days,
dismantle and remove the tower. If there are two (2) or more users of a single
tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease
using the tower.

other surety, at the time of construction, payable to the city. The bond or
surety shall be equivalent to the cost of demolition or removal of the proposed
facility in the event said owner is unable or unwilling to remove an abandoned
antenna or tower in conformance with the provision hereof. In order to
establish the bond or surety amount the owner/applicant at the time of
application shall provide the city with an estimate for the cost for demolition
or removal of the proposed tower/antenna. The city shall have the right to
accept or reject the owner/applicant's estimated amount. If the city rejects
the owner/applicant's estimate, the city may substitute its own estimate for
the cost of removal or demolition of the proposed antenna/tower. In all cases,
if the proposed tower/antenna significantly varies from the tower/antenna
presented for approval, a revised estimate shall be submitted to the city by
the owner/applicant. The city shall have the right to accept, reject and/or
substitute its own revised estimate for the cost of demolition of the tower/
antenna being considered for approval. All estimates proposed by the owner/
applicant shall be certified by an engineer. The city will have the right from
the date of construction of the tower/antenna, at intervals no more than every
three (3) years, to require that the bond/surety amount be increased to reflect
changes in the Chicago Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index (All Consumers)
during the prior three (3) year period.

signs overhanging or projecting over public rights of way, relieve pedestrian
and traffic congestion, provide more open space and avoid the "canceling out"
effect of adjacent signs.

Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this sign code and the
zoning provisions of the city, the provisions contained in this sign code shall
prevail; and if there is found a conflict between any provision of this sign
code, the more restrictive provision shall prevail.

ARTICLE XVII. HISTORIC PRESERVATION
Editor's noteâ Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 31, adopted March 26, 2010, renumbered Article
III of Chapter 26 to Article XVII of Appendix A and hereby is amended in its
entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, such article pertained to similar
subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 97-22, Â§ 1, 10-27-98.State Law
referenceâ 65 ILCS 5/11-48.2-1 et seq.
Section 17.1. Overlay districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Described: Overlay districts deal with special situations or
accomplish specific city goals that cannot be easily or efficiently addressed
through the use of base districts. As the name implies, overlay districts
"overlay" applicable base district classifications to alter some or all of the
zoning regulations that apply to particular sites. Overlay districts are shown
on the map entitled "Map of Historic Districts, Marshall, Illinois" maintained
by the city as part of this ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Effect: Overlay district regulations supplement the zoning
regulations of the applicable base district. When overlay district standards
conflict with the applicable base district standards or other regulations of
this ordinance, the regulations of the overlay district always govern. When no
special overlay district standards are specified, the base district standards
and all other applicable regulations of this ordinance will govern.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Designation: A landmark and a historic preservation district are
hereby designated an overlay district.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§Â§ 1, 31, 3-26-10)
Section 17.2. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to promote the protection, enhancement,
perpetuation, and use of improvements of special character or historical
interest or value in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, and
welfare of the people of the city by:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Providing a mechanism to identify and preserve the historic and
architectural characteristics of Marshall which represents elements of the
city's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To promote civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of
the past as represented in Marshall's landmarks and historic preservation
districts;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Stabilizing and improving the economic vitality and value of
Marshall's landmarks and historic areas;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Protecting and enhancing the attractiveness of the city to have
buyers, visitors and shoppers and thereby supporting business, commerce,
industry, and providing economic benefit to the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Fostering and encouraging preservation, restoration of structures,
areas, and neighborhoods and thereby preventing future urban blight.

Section 17.7. Landmark and historic preservation district designation
procedures.
The following procedures should be used for the preliminary determination of
the designation of a landmark or the designation of a historic preservation
district:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The secretary of the commission shall schedule a public hearing,
which hearing shall be held within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the
application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice of the public hearing shall be sent by mail to the owner(s)
of record and to the applicant(s) as well as to the adjoining property owners,
and a copy thereof shall be published in a newspaper having a general
circulation in the city, not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty
(30) days prior to the date of the hearing. The notice shall state the date,
time, place and purpose of the public hearing as well as the location of the
property and shall contain a statement summarizing how the proposed landmark or
proposed historic preservation district meets the criteria set forth in this
article.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â During the public hearing, the historic preservation commission
shall hear testimony and shall review and evaluate the application according to
the criteria established by this article.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If at the end of the public hearing the historic preservation
commission finds that the application merits further consideration, then the
historic preservation commission may reschedule the request until its next
scheduled meeting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A decision shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date
of the closing of the public hearing or of the rescheduled meeting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The decision by the historic commission whether or not the
structure, building or site should be designated a landmark or whether or not
the area should be designated a historic preservation district shall be made by
resolution passed by a majority of the commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Following the commission's decision, the secretary of the historic
preservation commission shall promptly prepare the historic preservation
commission's evaluation, recommendation and all available information for
submission to the city council which shall act upon the application within
sixty (60) days of receipt of the information from the secretary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The applicant(s) and the owner(s) of record shall be notified
promptly by a letter containing the historic preservation commission's
decision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â A simple majority vote by the city council is necessary for
approval of a landmark or historic preservation district designation, unless
the historic preservation commission has recommended to deny the application,
in which case a seventh-eighths (?) majority vote is necessary. The city
council must approve the application by passage of an ordinance adopting the
designation. If the city council approves the application for a designation, a
notice shall be sent to the applicant(s) and the owner(s) of record, the zoning
officer, the city clerk's office, and recorded with the county recorder of
deeds that the area has been designated as such. If the city council denies the
petition, no petitioner or applicant can re-file or re-apply a petition for the
same designation within ninety (90) days of the denial.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Buildings designated as historic landmarks and buildings located
within the boundaries of a historic preservation district shall be subject to
the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§Â§ 1, 31, 3-26-10)
Section 17.8. Certificate of appropriateness.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Scope: Buildings designated as landmarks or included within the
boundaries of a designated historic preservation district or properties for
which a preliminary determination of eligibility has been made shall be subject
to issuance of certificates of appropriateness. A certificate of
appropriateness shall be required for alteration, construction, removal or
demolition of a proposed landmark from the date when the nomination form is
presented to the historic preservation commission until the final disposition
of the request.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Certificate required: A certificate of appropriateness issued by
the commission shall be required before a building permit, moving permit, or
demolition permit is issued for any designated landmark or any building,
structure or site or part thereof in a historic preservation district. A
certificate of appropriateness is required if the building, structure or site
will be altered, extended, or repaired in such a manner as to produce a major
change in the exterior appearance of such building, structure or site. Such
major changes include, but are not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Major changes by addition, alteration, maintenance,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, renovation or repair.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Any new construction and demolition in whole or in part
requiring a permit from the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Moving a building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Any construction, alteration, demolition, or removal affecting a
significant exterior architectural feature as specified in the ordinance
designating the landmark or historic preservation district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Exemptions from certificate:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â An exception to the certificate of appropriateness shall be made
if the applicant shows to the zoning officer that a failure to grant the permit
will cause an imminent threat to life, health or property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for
landscaping, fencing, or driveways; provided, that said landscaping, fencing or
driveway work or repair does not alter the location of said landscaping,
fencing or driveways, and does not result in an alteration of the footprint of
the structure, landscape area or fence or driveway location. In the event there
is an alteration of the footprint of the landscape area or fence or driveway,
then the certificate of appropriateness is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Application: Applications for a certificate of appropriateness
shall be made available at city hall. Such applications shall be completed and
submitted to city hall and shall be forwarded to the historic preservation
commission. Every application affecting a designated landmark or any building,
structure or site or part thereof in a historic preservation district for a
demolition permit, a building permit, or a moving permit, including plans and
specifications, shall be forwarded by the zoning officer to the historic
preservation commission within seven (7) days following receipt of the
application by city hall. The application for issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness must include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The street address of the property involved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A legal description of the property involved or plat designation
(such as is available from the assessor's office or from a tax bill).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A brief description of the present improvements situated on the
property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A detailed description of the construction, alteration,
demolition or use proposed, together with any architect drawings or sketches if
those services have been utilized by the applicant, and if not, a sufficient
description of the construction, alteration, demolition, and use to enable the
commission to determine what final appearance and use of the real estate will
be.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The owner's name.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â The applicant's name.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â The developer's name, if different from the owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â A name of the architect or engineer, if used.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Standards: In making a determination whether to approve or deny an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic preservation
commission shall be guided by the United States Secretary of the Interior's
"Standards for Rehabilitation".
The standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a
reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical
feasibility. Said standards being:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed
in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of
the building and its site and environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
the structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Design guidelines: Design guidelines for applying the criteria for
review of certificates of appropriateness shall, at a minimum, consider the
following architectural criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction
should be compatible with the style and character of the landmark or of
contributing structures within a designated district and with surrounding
structures in a historic preservation district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Proportions of windows and doors: The proportions and
relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the
architectural style and character of the landmark or of contributing structures
within a designated district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Relationship of building masses and spaces: The relationship of
a structure within a historic preservation district to the open space between
it and adjoining structures should be compatible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Roof shape: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should
be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark or of
contributing structures within a designated district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration,
construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural
style and character and with surrounding structures in a historic preservation
district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Directional expression: Facades in historic preservation
districts should blend with other structures with regard to directional
expression. Structures in a historic preservation district should be compatible
with the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures.
The directional expression of a landmark after alteration, construction, or
partial demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style
and character.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Architectural details: Architectural details, including types of
materials, colors, and textures, should be treated so as to make the landmark
compatible with its original architectural style and character of a landmark or
of contributing structures within a designated district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â New structures: New structures in a historic preservation
district shall be compatible with the architectural styles and design in said
district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness: Upon approval of the
application, the historic preservation commission shall direct the recording
secretary to issue the signed certificate of appropriateness to the applicant
with copies forwarded to the zoning officer. A certificate of appropriateness
shall be invalid if changes in the plans reviewed by the historic preservation
commission are necessary in obtaining a building permit or if the building
permit issued for the same work becomes invalid. The certificate of
appropriateness remains valid for the same period of validity as the building
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Appeals: In the event of denial of an application for a certificate
of appropriateness, the applicant may, within thirty (30) days of the denial,
amend the application to accommodate the historic preservation commission
objections, apply to the commission for a certificate of economic hardship or
appeal the denial to the city council. The city council shall act on said
appeal within sixty (60) days. Denials appealed to the city council require a
seven-eighths (?) majority vote of the city council members present to overturn
a negative recommendation of the historic preservation commission.

Section 17.9. Certificate of economic hardship.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Scope: Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this article to the
contrary, the historic preservation commission may issue a certificate of
economic hardship to allow the performance of work for which a certificate of
appropriateness has been denied. Applicants claiming economic hardship shall be
required to seek rehabilitation assistance. The eligibility for and
availability of financial aid shall be considered by the historic preservation
commission in making its decision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Required information: An applicant for a certificate of economic
hardship may submit any or all of the following information in order to assist
the historic preservation commission in making its determination on the

party from whom purchased (including a description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon
according to the two (2) most recent assessments.

owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of
the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Any listing of the property for sale or rent, the price asked
and offers received, if any.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses
for the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â If the property is income producing, the annual gross income
from the property for the previous two (2) years, itemized operating and
maintenance expenses for the previous two (2) years, and annual cash flow
before and after debt service, if any, during the same period; form of
ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit
or not for profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture or other.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Any other information, including income tax bracket of the
owner, applicant or principal investors in the property, reasonably necessary
for a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield
a reasonable return to present or future owners.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Delay of application: If the historic preservation commission finds
that without approval of the proposed work, the property owner cannot obtain a
reasonable economic return therefrom, then the application shall be delayed for
a period not to exceed three (3) months. During this period of delay, the
historic preservation commission shall investigate plans and make
recommendations to the city council to allow for reasonably beneficial use or a
reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. Such
plans and recommendations may include, but are not limited to: a relaxation of
the provisions of this article, a reduction in real property taxes, financial
assistance, and/or changes in zoning regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Issuance or denial of certificate: If, by the end of the three (3)
month period, the historic preservation commission has found that without
approval of the proposed work, the property cannot be put to a reasonable
beneficial use, or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return
therefrom, then the historic preservation commission shall issue a certificate
of economic hardship approving the proposed work. If the historic preservation
commission finds otherwise, it shall deny the application for a certificate of
economic hardship.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Appeals: When a certificate of economic hardship is denied for
either a landmark or a structure within a historic preservation district, the
applicant(s) may, within thirty (30) days of the denial, appeal the historic
preservation commission's decision to the city council. The city council may
receive comments on the contents of the record, but no new matter may be
considered by the city council. The city council shall, within sixty (60) days,
affirm the decision or recommend changes by a majority vote of the city council
after due consideration of the facts contained in the record submitted to the
council by the historic preservation commission. A seven-eighths (?) majority
vote of the city council members present is required to overturn a negative
recommendation of the historic preservation commission. If the city council
decides that a certificate of economic hardship should be issued, the secretary
shall notify the applicant and the zoning officer within seven (7) days of the
city council's decision, and the zoning officer then shall issue the permit
within fifteen (15) days. If the city council concurs with the historic
preservation commission's decision not to issue a certificate of economic
hardship, the secretary shall notify the applicant and the zoning officer
within seven (7) days.

in the city clerk and shall be public record.
Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant the board

map; such power and authority is being reserved to the city council.

Section 22.3. Duties and powers.
The zoning board of appeals is organized under the zoning ordinance to hear
several types of zoning issues:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A request for a variation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An appeal of a decision made by the zoning officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A request for a determination of whether a proposed use is of the
same general character as, and compatible with, permitted uses in the zoning
district.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 22.4. Administration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Those who wish to address one (1) of the issues listed in section
22.3 should file with the zoning officer who will refer the case to the zoning
board of appeal for public hearing. A nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) shall be collected at this time, payable to the city
treasurer, to defer the cost publication and hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Once the filing procedure has been completed the zoning board of
appeals will conduct a public hearing where the applicant and/or a
representative may be present and make a decision to approve, modify or deny
the request within 60 days of filing of the complete application. In making its
decision, the zoning board of appeals may impose additional conditions or
modifications as are appropriate or necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare and to carry out the purpose of this ordinance. At the
hearing the zoning board of appeals will:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Hear evidence and testimony;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Review the standards and conditions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Prepare a findings of fact.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the request is approved, the zoning board of appeals will
authorize the zoning officer to take the appropriate actions.

1, 36, 3-26-10)
Section 22.5. Standards for a variation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Definition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Variation: A relaxation of the strict terms of the zoning
ordinance in order to provide relief for a property owner upon whom the zoning
ordinance imposes particular hardship or practical difficulties. Unlike an
amendment, a variation does not change the requirement of the zoning ordinance.
It is an exception to those requirements due to usual circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Standards for reviewing a variation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished for a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were to be carried out.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally, to other property with the same zoning classification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make money out of the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this ordinance
and has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of
the public street, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
Section 22.6. Appeals.
Pursuant to the Illinois Statutes a citizen has the right to appeal a decision
of the zoning officer. An appeal to the board is appropriate when an applicant
for a permit disputes a zoning interpretation made by the zoning officer. Such
appeals are based on the contention by the applicant that the zoning officer
has improperly interpreted the regulation and that the proper interpretation
would allow the applicant's proposed action.
(Ord. No. 10-3, Â§ 1, 3-26-10)
ARTICLE XXIII. ZONING COMMISSION

of the complete application. The city council will review the recommendation of
the zoning commission and approve or deny the request within sixty (60) days of
receiving the recommendation. The following standards shall be used when
considering a map amendment:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â That the proposed amendments is compatible with appropriate
uses, appropriate zoning classification and appropriate trends of development
in the general area; giving due consideration to dominant uses.

system are available or can be reasonably supplied to serve the uses permitted
in the proposed zoning classification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â That the proposed amendment is consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and that the development of the subject property for the
uses permitted in the proposed zoning classification will not have a
substantial detrimental effect on the drainage pattern in the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â That adequate services (including, but not limited to fire and
police protection, schools, water supply, and sewage disposal facilities) are
