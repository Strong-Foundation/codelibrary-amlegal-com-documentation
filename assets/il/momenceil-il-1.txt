The penalty provided in this chapter shall be applicable to every section of

Any person convicted of a violation of any section of this Code where a duty is
prescribed or obligation imposed, or where any action which is of a continuing
nature is forbidden or is declared to be unlawful, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day such

In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by
different clauses or sections of this Code, the Prosecuting Officer may elect
under which to proceed; but not more than one recovery shall be had against the
same person for the same offense; provided, that the revocation of a license or
permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other
penalty being enforced.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a
breach of any section or provision of this Code and there shall be no fine or
penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of this chapter
shall apply.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a
nuisance, or is a violation of the zoning or subdivision regulations of the
City 1 , in addition to any fine that may be imposed for said breach, the City
Attorney or any attorney retained by the City Council may petition for
injunctive relief to enjoin the doing of any act or the omission to do any act
which constitutes a nuisance or is a violation of the zoning or subdivision
regulations of the City. (Ord. 230, 7-3-1978; amd. 1979 Code)

1-5-10: ELECTRONIC ATTENDANCE:
   (A)   The member requesting electronic attendance, such as by telephone,

   (B)   The city clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance request,
shall inform the city council of the request for electronic attendance.
   (C)   The following conditions must be met before a member of the city
council may attend any open meeting electronically 1 .
      1.   After a roll call establishing that a quorum is physically present,
the presiding officer shall call for a motion before one or more members will
be permitted to attend by electronic means. The presiding officer will specify
the reason entitling the absent member, or members, to attend electronically.
The motion must be approved by a vote of a majority of the members present. The
presiding officer shall declare the requesting member, or members, present. The
vote may not be reconsidered.
      2.   If more than one member participates by electronic means, the absent
members may not meet at the same remote location if their joint presence at the
remote location would constitute a violation of the Illinois open meetings act.
      3.   The member must assert one of the following three (3) reasons why he
or she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the city of Momence; or
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency.
      4.   The member seeking participation shall be available on the telephone
or other communication device not less than five (5) minutes prior to the
meeting.
      5.   Costs associated with the member's participation shall be borne
solely by the member and not the city.
   (D)   The member participating electronically and other members of the city
council must be able to communicate effectively, and members of the audience
must be able to hear all communications at the meeting site. Before allowing
electronic attendance at any meeting, the city of Momence shall provide
equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
   (E)   If the presiding officer of the public body is attending the meeting
by electronic means, then the person who acts in the absence of the presiding
officer shall chair the meeting. If there is none, then the presiding officer
shall appoint a member of the public body who is physically present at the
meeting to serve as chair of the meeting. The appointment of a chair shall be
subject to the consent of the public body. The presiding officer who is
participating by electronic means shall be authorized to participate in the
meeting to the extent authorized by law or ordinance except for those acts
involved with chairing the meeting.
   (F)   Any member attending electronically shall be considered an off site
attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting. The meeting
minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is
physically present or present by electronic means.
   (G)   Any member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express
his or her comments during the meeting and participate in the same capacity as
those members physically present, subject to all general meeting guidelines and
procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The member attending
electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called
during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the city
clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member
attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any
member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her
leaving and returning.
   (H)   No member of a public body who is participating electronically in a
public meeting shall be permitted to participate in any portion of the meeting
which is closed to the public, including, but not limited to, executive
sessions which are closed to the public under the applicable provisions of the
open meetings act, 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 120/1 et seq.
   (I)   No member of a public body may participate electronically in a public
meeting more than twelve (12) times in a fiscal year. (Ord. 748, 10-15-2012)

operation of the department and its officers not inconsistent with these rules.
He shall keep an inventory of all property of the department and shall maintain
all other records deemed necessary for the safe and orderly operation of the

lawful orders from the Chief of Police or the officer in command. Orders may be
oral unless the Chief proposes to establish a rule of general application, and

the opinion that such order is unlawful or improper, he shall call a meeting of
the Police Committee for the purpose of considering the allowance or revocation

employment form and upon exhibiting satisfactory evidence to the Police
Committee of the City of Momence that he or she qualifies in all respects to be
a police officer within the City of Momence and State of Illinois. All police
officers, other than those officers who shall be employed on a full time basis,

time of hiring, the City Council, or the current labor contract, shall set the
wages of said officer. (Ord. 701, 1-3-2011)

may at any time during said period be fired for any reason by the City Council
and said fact shall further be communicated to the officer at the time of his
or her hiring.

to be an emergency, regular tours of duty may be extended and personal leaves
may be canceled.

severity of the injury, report the same orally to the Police Committee of the
City of Momence and shall within five (5) days thereafter file a written report
with the Chief of Police advising him of the nature and circumstances
surrounding the injury. Any injured officer absent from work for more than one
week as a result of said injury shall submit to an examination by a physician
selected by the Chief of Police to determine the nature and extent of said
injury. No officer so examined shall return to work until said physician gives
his written opinion to the Chief of Police that the officer is capable of
returning to work.
      5.   Any officer absent from work on account of illness or injury shall
notify the Chief of Police as soon as the illness or injury occurs. Such notice
must be given at least two (2) hours prior to the time said officer is to
report for duty, if possible; otherwise said officer shall not be paid for the
sick day. All officers claiming pay for sick leave in excess of five (5)
consecutive days shall, before returning to work, submit a physician's
certificate stating the nature and extent of the illness or injury causing the
absence and also stating whether the physician is of the opinion that the
illness or injury is cured and the officer is able to return to work as a
police officer.

with pay which can be used for illness, business, or any other lawful reason.

vacation from duty with pay as set from time to time in accordance with the

personnel remain on and available for duty within the City of Momence. Any days
taken as vacation shall be taken in blocks of at least two (2) consecutive
days.
   (E)   Secondary Employment: No officer shall accept any other employment
unless and until the officer shall submit a request for permission to do so to
the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police shall have the final decision on
whether or not to grant the right to such officer to be employed in any other
occupation other than as a police officer. Any officer who engages in
employment outside of his regular duties as a police officer of the City of
Momence shall be subject to call at any time to perform the duties and fill the
responsibilities of a police officer of the City of Momence. In the event that
the Chief of Police determines that any secondary employment previously granted
permission for is conflicting with the ability of the officer to perform his
duties as a police officer of the City of Momence, he shall notify the officer
and the officer shall forthwith terminate such secondary employment. The Chief
of Police or the acting Chief of Police shall not, however, unless expressly
authorized by the Police Committee of the City of Momence, accept any other
employment while acting in the capacity as Chief of Police or acting Chief of
Police of the Momence Police Department. In the event that the Chief of Police
or acting Chief of Police desires to accept secondary employment, he shall
notify the Chairman of the Police Committee. Thereafter, the Chairman of the
Police Committee shall call a meeting as soon as is reasonably possible for the
purpose of discussing and deciding whether or not to authorize the Chief of
Police to so accept such secondary employment. In the event that the Police
Committee deems it acceptable for the Chief of Police to accept such secondary
employment, it shall so determine by a majority vote of those members present
at said meeting and may set certain restrictions and parameters on the nature
and extent of such secondary employment. In the event that the Police Committee
finds that said secondary employment would provide a conflict with said chief
of police's duties and responsibilities as chief of police, it shall so
determine. The decision of the police committee in this matter shall be final.
   (F)   Intergovernmental Cooperation: All officers shall cooperate with the
department and all other governmental agencies in the conduct of investigations
of criminal matters or instances involving police officers. Refusal to testify
before federal, state, county, or local courts, grand juries, investigative
committees, or the police committee of the city of Momence shall constitute
improper conduct and subject the officer to discipline.
   (G)   Property And Equipment:
      1.   Officers are responsible for the proper care of the department
property entrusted to them. Upon separation from the employ of the city of
Momence, all officers shall turn in and surrender to the chief of police all

complaint against another officer, known or unknown, from any source or agency,
whether written or oral, shall take such complaint in a courteous and efficient
manner. This complaint shall be forwarded in writing to the chief of police and
the chairman of the police committee. If the chief of police believes there is
a basis for further investigation, he shall so advise the chairman of the
police committee and the chairman shall then call a meeting of the police
committee to investigate and determine if there is any need for any further
action in regard to any of the allegations made in such complaint.

      1.   Officers are considered to be on duty or eligible for duty at all
times and, therefore, shall be civilly armed but shall not be required to carry

activity. The chief of police is authorized to develop, promulgate, and form
rules and regulations regarding the equipment, uniforms, and weapons to be used
by all officers.
      2.   Whenever an officer discharges his firearm for whatever reason,
except in a firing range, he shall verbally notify the chief of police of such

to the chief of police. A copy of such report shall also be sent to the
chairman of the police committee. Officers shall not possess their firearms in
any tavern or other place where alcoholic beverages are served except in the
line of duty.

or personal purpose.

without the prior permission of the chief of police. Officers shall at all
times be courteous and orderly in their dealings with the public. They shall
perform their duties in a professional manner avoiding harsh, violent, profane,
or insolent language and shall always remain calm regardless of the
provocation. Upon request of any citizen, officers shall supply their name and
number. They shall tend to requests of the public quickly and accurately
consistent with their obligations of the law and shall not criticize any other
officer or the chief of police in such a public fashion which would tend to
impair the operation of the department by impairing its efficiency and
interfering with the ability to maintain discipline. All officers shall make
maximum utilization of the grievance procedures as hereinafter set out to
resolve differences and disputes.
   (M)   Accidents: Accidents involving an officer and city property shall be
communicated in writing to the chief of police and the chairman of the police
committee as soon after such accident as is reasonably proper. Such report
shall describe the nature of the business of the officer at the time of the
activity, the names and addresses of all persons involved and all witnesses to
the accident, whether or not any person suffered injury and the nature of the
injury, and what the damage was to the vehicle involved.
   (N)   Department Use Of Motor Vehicles:
      1.   Officers shall not use any department vehicles for anything other
than official business while on duty and shall keep and maintain at all times a
valid driver's license necessary to operate said police vehicle. Each officer
assigned to such a vehicle shall be responsible for the proper use and care of
said vehicle and all property located therein. At the beginning of each tour of
duty, the officer assigned a vehicle shall inspect the vehicle to assure that
it is in good condition and any defect or damage shall be verbally reported to
the chief of police with a written report prepared at the end of tour duty. In
the event that the condition of any vehicle is such that the officer believes
it unsafe, he shall so notify the chief of police immediately who shall then
remedy the situation by causing the vehicle to be repaired and put in good
working condition and order.
      2.   Officers shall operate vehicles in a reasonable and prudent manner
having due regard for the traffic laws and shall at all times obey the traffic
laws and courtesies of the road and shall not be excused from obeying such laws
except when operating a police vehicle as an emergency vehicle.
      3.   When operating a vehicle in response to an emergency assignment, the
officer shall take due care and caution to maintain control of said vehicle and
when operating the vehicle in pursuit of a known offender shall always weigh
the risk involved against the nature of the offense which caused the pursuit.
Pursuit will be terminated when the risk of the high speed pursuit outweighs
the desirability of apprehension. Sirens shall be used only in those situations
in which an emergency is thought to exist or where the officer is so directed
by the chief of police.
   (O)   Personal Conduct: Officers will abide by all federal, state, county,
and city laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. In addition to engaging in
the proper conduct of a police officer under the direction of the chief of
police and without limiting the obligations of all officers, all officers
shall: 1) obey all lawful orders, 2) perform their duties in a prompt and
expeditious fashion, 3) refrain from unnecessary shouting or the use of obscene
vocal language, and 4) promptly respond to requests for police service.
Officers shall not take a meal or refreshment break in a public place while on
duty without the approval of the chief of police and shall not solicit gifts,
presents, money, free admissions, or other gratuities as a police officer.
Officers working part time jobs wearing their police uniforms shall be subject
while on such job to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with
these rules and regulations. They shall conduct their private and professional
lives in a manner to avoid bringing the department to disrepute.
   (P)   Performance Of Duties:

ordinances and shall do their best to protect life and property, prevent crime,
and arrest persons believed by officers to have committed crimes when found
within the city of Momence.
      2.   Officers who are subpoenaed to testify at any civil trial or hearing

economic cycles, taking into account the city's investment risk constraints,

shall diversify investments to avoid incurring unreasonable risks from the
practice of concentrating investments in specific security types and/or
individual financial institutions.
      4.   The city of Momence will avoid any transaction that might impair
public confidence. Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which personnel of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs. Such standards,

safety of capital, rather than the probable income to be derived.

written cash management procedures, which shall include, but not be limited to,
the following:
      1.   Receipts: All monies due the city shall be collected as promptly as
possible. Monies that are received shall be deposited in an approved financial
institution no later than the next business day after receipt by the city. The
city council shall subject to any available legal means of collection
previously approved, amounts that remain uncollected, after a reasonable length
of time. One of the objectives of the city's cash management procedures is to
comply with the provisions of the Illinois Compiled Statutes which mandates
prompt investment of funds.

services or to employees for salaries and wages shall be contingent upon
available appropriation.
      3.   Financial Forecast: At least annually, a financial forecast will be
prepared using expected revenue sources and items of expenditures to project
cash requirements for future years of the city. Analysis will be prepared for
both operating and nonoperating revenues and expenditures. These analyses will
provide a guide for determining the length and amount of investments.
      4.   Pooling Of Cash: Except where otherwise provided by the city
council, the treasurer, or his/her designee, will be authorized to pool the
cash of various funds to maximize investment earnings, where, in his/her

   (F)   Accounting: The assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenditures of
each fund are maintained as separate entities on the modified accrual basis.

institutions on the following basis:
      1.   Security: The city of Momence shall maintain funds in a financial
institution only if the institution is federally insured.

provided local institutions are price competitive with respect to rates of
return on comparable investment products.
      3.   State Of Condition: The city of Momence will maintain for public and
managerial inspection, current statements of condition for each financial
institution named as depository. If, for any reason, the information furnished
is considered by the city of Momence to be insufficient, the city may request
additional information.
      4.   Statement: Each institution shall be required to submit, in writing,
a statement that they have received, read, and understood the city's investment
policy.

of the United States do not require collateral.
      1.   The city is hereby adopting, by reference, the provisions of the
Illinois public funds investment act 1 , and all amendments from time to time
made therein, and excepting any portions thereof specifically superseded by
this title.
      2.   Pledged collateral will be held by the city in safekeeping and
evidenced by a safekeeping agreement. The collateral agreement will preclude
the release of the pledged assets without authorized signatures of the city
treasurer, but the agreement may allow for an exchange of collateral of like
value.

And Poors.
         (a)   Negotiable obligations of the United States government.
         (b)   Negotiable obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the
United States government guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United
States government.
   (J)   Internal Control: The city treasurer or his/her designee, shall
establish a system of internal controls, which shall be documented in writing.
These internal controls and this investment policy shall be reviewed by an
independent certified public accountant in conjunction with the annual
examination of the financial statements of the city of Momence. The controls
shall be designed to prevent loss of city funds arising from fraud, employee
error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial
markets, or imprudent actions by employees.
      1.   One requirement of internal control is timely reconciliation of all
checking, saving, and investment accounts under the jurisdiction of the
treasurer's office. Reconciliation shall be performed on a monthly basis and
shall be completed no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the monthly
cycle.

employees responsible for the investment of public funds shall be the "prudent
person" standard, subject to the foregoing limitations, which states:
      1.   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, with persons knowledgeable of investment
practices, and persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercised in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculations of the investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the possible
income to be derived.
      2.   The above standard is established as the standard of professional
responsibility, and shall be applied in the context of managing the city
investment portfolio. This policy recognizes that there are circumstances
beyond the control of even the most prudent investor, which impact the return
obtained. However, officials and employees of the city, acting in accordance
with this investment policy, and written procedures as may be established, as
exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an
individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that
deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion, and appropriate
action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (M)   Investment/Policy Adoption: The city of Momence's investment policy
shall be adopted by ordinance. The city council and/or treasurer shall review
this policy on an annual basis, and the city council must approve any
modifications made thereto. (Ord. 788, 11-17-2014)

city of Momence as an additional insured, verifying that the principal has in
effect at the time of the application dramshop or liquor liability insurance in
the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The certificate of insurance
shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.
   (E)   With any license application submitted for an original or renewal
license to be effective May 1, 2016, or thereafter, the applicant shall include
certificates of completion of BASSETT or TIPS training, as described in

to be approved by the commissioner conditioned on the faithful performance of
the provisions of this chapter and the laws of the state of Illinois and upon
the payment of all fines and costs which may be assessed against the licensee
for violation of any of the provisions hereof. (Ord. 800, 10-5-2015)
3-2-7: MANAGEMENT ENTITIES:
It is recognized that a licensee may, from time to time, desire to hire or
retain, as an independent contractor, a management entity to manage, generally
operate and be responsible for the licensed premises. For purposes of this
section, "management entity" does not mean the designated manager of the
licensed premises, as provided in section
3-2-21 of this chapter. No licensee shall permit a management entity to perform
such a function unless the management entity has been certified to do so by the
commissioner. In order to be certified by the commissioner, a management entity
must execute a liquor license application that reflects the entity's business
status, i.e., sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation. A management
entity must qualify in the same manner (other than for a surety bond and
dramshop coverage) and meet the same standards as a licensee. A management
entity shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner in the same
manner as a licensee. If there is a violation on the premises, the management
company and the licensee shall be jointly and severally responsible and liable
for any penalty assessed. (Ord. 800, 10-5-2015)

other regulatory provisions of this Chapter shall apply to such temporary

Class A license No Limit

Nothing herein shall prevent any establishment from obtaining multiple licenses

2022; Ord. 885, 3-8-2024)

3-2-15: TRANSFER OF LICENSE, TERMINATION:
A license shall be purely a personal privilege, good for not to exceed one year
after issuance, unless sooner revoked as set forth in this chapter. The license
shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment,
garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable, voluntarily or
involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or alienated. The license is not
transferable to any other person, party, entity or location either for
consideration or not for consideration. As to a closely held corporation, an
illegal transfer will be deemed to have been attempted and the license shall
become null and void if any person owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the
stock transfers the stock to another person who previously held less than fifty
percent (50%) of the stock. As to a public corporation, an illegal transfer
will be deemed to have been attempted and the license shall become null and
void if there has been a buyout, a takeover or any other transaction involving
the sale or transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the stock or assets of
the corporation. A license issued to an individual or a partnership shall cease
upon the death of the licensee or a partner of a licensee and shall not descend
by the laws of testate or intestate devolution. However, the executors or
administrators of the estate of any deceased licensee, and the trustee of any
insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when the estate consists in part of alcoholic
liquor may, upon written notice to the commissioner, continue the business of
the sale of alcoholic liquor under the order of the appropriate court. In such
cases, the executor, administrator or trustee may exercise the privileges of
the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of decedent, or
such insolvency or bankruptcy until the expiration of the license, or until six
(6) months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of the licensee, whichever
occurs first. If a corporation to whom a license has been issued is ordered
into receivership or files for bankruptcy, the receiver or trustee may continue
the operation of the business under the existing license under order of the
appropriate court until the expiration of the license or until the passage of
six (6) months from the date of appointment of a receiver or trustee, whichever
comes first. Upon the death of any person owning five percent (5%) or more of
the shares in a closely held corporation, the commission shall be notified and
if the shares are transferred to a person who is not currently named in the
application as a shareholder, then the licensee shall apply for a new license.
Upon the alienation, sale, transfer, assignment or donation of the business
that underlies the license to any third party or person other than the
licensee, the liquor license shall automatically become void and the number of
available licenses in that classification as authorized by the corporate
authorities shall automatically and immediately be reduced by one. Any licensed
establishment that has discontinued the sale or service of alcoholic liquor or
that has not been open for business at least four (4) days per week for a
period of thirty (30) days or more shall automatically forfeit its license. Any
licensed establishment that has discontinued the sale or service of alcoholic
liquor, has not been open for business at least four (4) days per week for a
period of thirty (30) days or more or whose license shall have been terminated,
shall automatically forfeit its license. Upon the forfeiture of the license,
for any of these reasons, the number of available licenses set forth in Section
3-2-1, shall be automatically reduced by one, even without an Ordinance
actually reducing the number. However, the City, in its broad discretion as
provided by law, wishes to issue another license, it may do so up to the number
of licenses that remain listed within Section
3-2-11. City shall notify any entity seeking a license whether based upon the
number shown in Section
3-2-11, or automatically reduced in accordance with Section
3-2-15, the applicant is applying for a then available license or will need to
seek the broad discretion of the City in issuing what in effect will be a new
license but within the maximum number of licenses then contained within Section
3-2-11. (Ord. 800, 10-5-2015; amd. Ord. 872, 3-7-2022)
3-2-16: CHANGE OF LOCATION:
A liquor license shall permit the sale of alcoholic liquor only on the premises
described in the application and license. Such location may be changed only
upon written permission to make such change, issued by the commissioner after a
report to the city council. No change of location shall be permitted unless the
proposed new location is a proper one for the sale of alcoholic liquor under
the laws of this state and the regulations of the city. (Ord. 800, 10-5-2015)
3-2-17: POSTING LICENSE; CONFISCATION:
Every person licensed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall
immediately post and keep posted and in effect, in a conspicuous place on the
premises, the license so issued. In the event such license shall be lost or
destroyed, a duplicate in lieu thereof shall be issued by the city clerk upon
direction of the commissioner. In the event such license is suspended or
revoked, the posted license shall be confiscated by the police department.

any state or local offense, the prosecutor, upon reasonable grounds, may
request a ruling and the court shall rule as to whether the consumption of an
alcoholic beverage, as permitted by the parent, was a contributing factor to
the commission of the offense. If it is so determined in the affirmative, then
the penalty set forth in subsection (D) of this section shall apply. For
purposes of this section, the consumption of alcohol may be determined to be a
contributing factor if it had the effect of substantially causing an impairment
to the person as "impairment" is defined in this chapter. It need not be shown
that, but for the consumption of alcohol, the offense would not have been
committed.
         (b)   The parent shall remain vicariously liable as set forth in

than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any person found guilty by a court of

shall not bar prosecution in a court of law for the same acts.
   (E)   Vicarious Liability Of A Parent Or Other Person Facilitating The Use
Or Abuse Of Alcoholic Liquor: The following persons shall be liable to any
individual who has been injured by an alcohol impaired underage person when the
impairment is a contributing cause of the injury:
      1.   Any person who delivered or permitted the delivery of an alcoholic
liquor to the underage person. The person making or permitting the initial
delivery to an underage person remains liable to anyone injured by the same or
different underage person regardless of how many times the alcoholic liquor
changed hands.
      2.   Any person in control of a premises, who knowingly or negligently
fails to maintain supervision to such an extent that an alcoholic liquor is
consumed on the premises by an underage person.
      3.   Any person who knowingly or negligently allows the operation of a
motor vehicle under his or her control by an underage person, when the person
knew or in the exercise of ordinary judgment should have known that the
underage person was either impaired or had consumed any amount of alcohol
within two (2) hours prior to when this allowance to drive occurred. The
vicarious liability established by this chapter shall not be subject to the
limitations on damages as set forth in 235 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/6-21.
   (F)   Use Of False Identification: Any underage person found guilty by a
court of law of attempting to obtain delivery of an alcoholic liquor by use of
false proof of age shall be subject to a mandatory fine of five hundred dollars
($500.00) for the first offense and seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for
each subsequent offense. If the false proof of age was an improperly used
driver's license, the person so using it shall not be permitted, for a period
of six (6) months, to operate a motor vehicle on any public way within the
corporate limits of the city unless accompanied by a licensed driver over
thirty (30) years of age, subject to the provisions of subsection (J) of this
section.
   (G)   False Identification Not A Defense: It shall not be a defense to any
action brought criminally, civilly or administratively against any liquor
licensee or any other person charged with the delivery of any alcoholic liquor
to an underage person that such a person produced false identification or false
proof of age. The person or persons hearing and deciding the charges may
consider such a claim when determining the penalty to be assessed or the
apportionment of damages.
   (H)   Operation Of A Motor Vehicle While In A State Of Impairment: It shall
be unlawful for any underage person to operate a motor vehicle on a street or
highway of the city while in a state of impairment due to the consumption of an
alcoholic liquor or with any alcohol at all in his or her system. For purposes
of this chapter only, "operation of a motor vehicle" shall have the definition
ascribed to it in the Illinois vehicle code rather than the definition set
forth in section
3-2-1 of this chapter.
   (I)   Operation Of A Motor Vehicle By Underage Persons With Alcoholic Liquor
In Or On The Vehicle: When an underage person operating a motor vehicle is
impaired due to alcohol or has alcohol in the system or is operating a vehicle
in violation of a restriction pursuant to this chapter, the following shall
apply:
      1.   The motor vehicle shall be subject to immediate impoundment by the
police department.
      2.   The following factors shall not be considerations in determining
whether or not to impound the motor vehicle:
         (a)   Whether the alcoholic liquor is in an opened or an unopened
container.
         (b)   Whether the operator is the owner of the alcoholic liquor in the
vehicle.
         (c)   Whether the owner or operator had knowledge of the existence of
the alcoholic liquor within the motor vehicle.
      3.   Upon impoundment, the motor vehicle may be released only to another
person showing proof of ownership or lease rights to the motor vehicle. If the
underage operator is the owner or lessor of the vehicle, then the vehicle may
be released only to a parent or spouse of the underage owner. If the underage
person has no parent or spouse living in the immediate area, the vehicle may be
released, upon satisfactory proof of such fact, as set forth in subsection (I)4
of this section.
      4.   The motor vehicle may not be released to any person who was a
passenger in the motor vehicle at the time the alcoholic liquor or impairment
was found unless at least twenty four (24) hours have passed from the time of
the finding.
      5.   The vehicle shall not be released until the person seeking the
release has paid an administrative fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to the
city, plus any towing or storage costs.
      6.   If the operator is subsequently found guilty of driving with open
alcohol in a motor vehicle or possession of alcohol by a minor or of operating
a motor vehicle while impaired pursuant to subsection (H) of this section, that
person shall not be permitted for a period of six (6) months, to operate a
motor vehicle on any public way within the limits of the city unless
accompanied by a licensed driver over thirty (30) years of age.
      7.   The above obligations and penalties shall be in addition to the
penalties that may be assessed in a court of law for any charges arising out of
the incident.
      8.   Any law enforcement officer, the police department and the city and
any of its officers or agents shall be absolutely immune from any liability or
exposure to liability of any kind or nature for the enforcement or
implementation of this chapter.
   (J)   Procedure For Driving Restriction Notification; Hearing:
      1.   If a person has committed a violation that subjects the person to a
restriction on driving in Momence, such a restriction shall not take place
until the police department has sent, by regular mail, a notice of the pending
driving restriction. The notice shall be mailed at least two (2) weeks before
the restriction is to go into effect and shall contain: a) a statement that the
restriction applies only to the city; b) the date the restriction is to go into
effect and the date on which it ends; c) a map showing the city limits; d) a
notice that the operator has the right to request a hearing within ten (10)
days of notification to determine the validity of the restriction. The validity
of the restriction may be challenged only on the grounds that the person was
not the actual person found guilty or that there was no finding of guilty for
the underlying offense.
      2.   The hearing shall be conducted by a supervisory member of the city
police department, appointed by the chief of police and whose determination
shall be a final administrative decision.
   (K)   Penalty For Violating Driving Restriction:
      1.   Restriction: No person shall operate and no person, including a
parent, shall permit another to operate a motor vehicle within the corporate
limits of the city in violation of the restrictions set forth in this chapter.
      2.   Penalty: Any person found guilty by a court of law of violating this
subsection (K) shall be fined in the mandatory amount of seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00).
   (L)   Zero Tolerance With Respect To Alcohol Use: It shall be unlawful for
any underage person to have any alcohol of any level detectable by observation
or blood/alcohol testing in the person's system. If the blood/alcohol level is
less than .05 milliliters of alcohol per liter of blood, then it shall be a
defense that the alcohol was acquired pursuant to the exceptions set forth in
subsection (C) of this section. Such defense may be established by clear and
convincing evidence by the testimony of the adult providing the alcoholic
liquor.
   (M)   Possession Of Alcohol By Underage Persons: It shall be unlawful for
any person under the age of twenty one (21) to possess, dispense, or consume
alcoholic liquor. Any person to whom the sale, gift or delivery of any
alcoholic liquor is prohibited because of age shall not purchase, accept a gift
of such alcoholic liquor or have such alcoholic liquor in his possession. (Ord.
800, 10-5-2015)
3-2-32: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
Violation of any provision of this chapter may be prosecuted as an
administrative offense before the commissioner if the offender is the holder of
a license issued by the commissioner, and independently in a court of law as a
violation of this code.
   (A)   General: Unless another penalty is set forth in this chapter, every
person found guilty of a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter by
the commissioner shall be subject to an administrative penalty of not more than
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed to have been committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs
or continues. Any fines set forth in this chapter shall be assessed regardless
of whether the violator is convicted or placed on supervision by the court.
   (B)   Substance Abuse: If the offense is related to alcohol or substance
abuse and the offender is under twenty one (21) years of age, the court or
administrative adjudication hearing officer may assign the offender to a drug
and alcohol education and abuse counseling program that is licensed by the
Illinois department of alcohol and substance abuse and requires a certified
evaluation program and not less than four (4) hours of counseling. If the
violator agrees to attend such a program, the violator shall pay for the cost
of the program and a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first offense.
For a second offense, the offender shall attend a drug and alcohol education
and counseling program of at least ten (10) hours in duration as determined by
the licensed program and shall pay for the cost of the program and a fine of
not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). If the offense is related to
alcohol or substance abuse and the offender is under twenty one (21) years of
age and is either found guilty or pleads no contest and agrees to pay the
applicable fine, the city will report the person to the secretary of state's
office and his/her driver's license will be suspended in accordance with state
law. (Ord. 800, 10-5-2015)

      25.   Nonrenewals, suspensions and revocations of an adult establishment

         (a)   In the event that the city proposes to not renew, to suspend or

for the action. The council will hold a hearing for the purpose of determining

decision within that period.
         (b)   If the council determines to suspend or revoke a license, the
suspension or revocation is not effective until fifteen (15) days after
notification of the decision to the licensee. If, within that fifteen (15)
days, the licensee files and serves an action in state or federal court
challenging the council's action the suspension or revocation is stayed until
the conclusion of such action.
         (c)   If the city council determines not to renew a license, the
licensee may continue its business for fifteen (15) days after receiving notice
of such nonrenewal, if the licensee files and serves an action in state or
federal court within the fifteen (15) days for the purpose of determining
whether the city acted properly, the licensee may continue in business until
the conclusion of the action.
      26.   After denial of an application or a renewal of an application, or

prompt judicial review of such action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

elapsed when an application is made, the fee shall be reduced to one-half (1/2)
the regular amount. The fee is nonrefundable. (Ord. 675, 4-5-2010)

representatives of the police department, fire department, and building
inspector, to inspect the premises of an adult establishment for the purpose of

and operation of the business.
      30.   Refusal to permit a lawful inspection of the premises by health
officials, representatives of the police department, fire department, or
building inspector at any time it is occupied or open for business is a

nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of the license.
      31.   The provisions of this section do not apply to areas of an adult
hotel or motel that are currently being rented by a customer for use as a
permanent or temporary habitation. "Temporary habitation" is defined as a

place other than the address designated in the application.
      33.   Any person violating any provision of this section shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be subject to the penalties for a

be considered a separate misdemeanor offense punishable by a separate
misdemeanor penalty. The city may also enforce any provision of this section by

direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
"Development" does not include maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar practices
that do not involve a change in the ground surface elevation.
FEMA: Federal emergency management agency.
FLOOD: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation,
or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD FRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP: A map prepared by the federal emergency management
agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (SFHA) within a
community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or may not depict
floodways and show base flood elevations.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION OR FPE: The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot (1') of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
FLOODPLAIN: "Floodplain" and "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" are synonymous.
Those lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are subject to inundation
by the base flood. The floodplains of the city are generally identified as such
on the flood insurance rate map of the city prepared by the federal emergency
management agency and dated November 20, 1996. The floodplains of those parts
of unincorporated Kankakee County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city are generally
identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for Kankakee County
by the federal emergency management agency and dated September 6, 1996.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.
FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE: A form published by the federal emergency management
agency that is used to certify that a building has been designed and
constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection
elevation.
FLOODWAY: That portion of the floodplain required to store and convey the base
flood. The floodway for the floodplains of Kankakee River shall be as
delineated on the flood boundary and floodway map prepared by FEMA and dated
September 6, 1996. The floodway for each of the remaining floodplains of the
city shall be according to the best data available from federal, state, or
other sources.
IDOT/DWR: Illinois department of transportation/division of water resources.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, that is
build on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
NFIP: National flood insurance program.
SFHA: See definition of Floodplain.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either: a) before the improvement or repair is
started, or b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either: a) any improvement of a
structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or b) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register
of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places. (Ord. 450, 11-
4-1996)
4-5-3: DUTIES OF THE BUILDING INSPECTOR:
The building inspector shall be responsible for the general administration of
this chapter and ensure that all development activities within the floodplains

   (B)   Ensure that all development in a floodway (or a floodplain with no
delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of section
4-5-6 of this chapter;
   (C)   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to section
4-5-7 of this chapter are met and maintain a record of the "as built" elevation
of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   (D)   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
section
4-5-8 of this chapter;
   (E)   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter are met and maintain documentation of any variances
granted;
   (F)   Inspect all development projects and take any and all actions outlined
in section
4-5-11 of this chapter as necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
   (G)   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, state and federal permits;
   (H)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
   (I)   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
and
   (J)   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps,
copies of state or federal permits and documentation of compliance for
development activities subject to this chapter. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-4: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
The best available base flood elevation data are listed below. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit
it to the federal emergency management agency for approval.
   (A)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of Kankakee River shall
be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of
the city prepared by the federal emergency management agency and dated November
20, 1996.
   (B)   The base flood elevation for each floodplain delineated as an "AH
zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood
insurance rate map of the city.
   (C)   The base flood elevation for each of the remaining floodplains
delineated as an "A zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the city shall be
according to the best data available from federal, state or other sources.
Should no other data exist, an engineering study should be done to determine
base flood elevations.
   (D)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Kankakee County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city, or that may be annexed into the city, shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of
Kankakee County prepared by the federal emergency management agency and dated
September 6, 1996. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law
shall commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the building inspector. The building inspector shall
not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for a development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and
      4.   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the building
inspector shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation.
Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to have been
higher than the base flood elevation as of the date of the site's first flood
insurance rate map identification is not in the floodplain and therefore not
subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building inspector shall
maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site
and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first flood insurance rate map identification. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-6: PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES:
Within the floodway identified on the flood boundary and floodway map, and
within all other floodplains where a floodway has not been delineated, the
following standards shall apply:
   (A)   Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, no development
shall be allowed which, acting in combination with existing and anticipated
development, will cause any increase in flood heights or velocities or threat
to public health and safety. The following specific development activities
shall be considered as meeting this requirement:
      1.   Barge fleeting facilities meeting the conditions of IDOT/DWR
statewide permit no. 3;
      2.   Aerial utility crossings meeting the conditions of IDOT/DWR
statewide permit no. 4;

meeting the conditions of IDOT/DWR statewide permit no. 10;
      9.   Minor maintenance dredging activities meeting the conditions of
IDOT/DWR statewide permit no. 11; and
      10.   Any development determined by IDOT/DWR to be located entirely in a
flood fringe area.
   (B)   Other development activities not listed in subsection (A) of this
section may be permitted only if:
      1.   A permit has been issued for the work by IDOT/DWR (or written
documentation is provided that an IDOT/DWR permit is not required); and
      2.   Sufficient data has been provided to FEMA when necessary to approve
a revision of the regulatory map and base flood elevation. (Ord. 450, 11-4-
1996)

870.
      4.   Nonresidential buildings may be structurally floodproofed (in lieu
of elevation) provided a registered professional engineer certifies that:
         (a)   Below the flood protection elevation the structure and attendant
utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the
base flood;
         (b)   The building design accounts for flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and
impacts from debris and ice; and
         (c)   Floodproofing measures will be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
Levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered floodproofing
for the purpose of this subsection. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-8: OTHER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
The city council shall take into account flood hazards, to the extent that they
are known, in all official actions related to land management use and
development.
   (A)   New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements,
planned unit developments (PUDs), and additions to manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall meet the damage prevention and building protection standards
of sections
4-5-6 and
4-5-7 of this chapter. Any proposal for such development shall include the
following data:
      1.   The base flood elevation and the boundary of the floodplain (where
the base flood elevation is not available from an existing study, the applicant
shall be responsible for calculating the base flood elevation);
      2.   The boundary of the floodway when available; and
      3.   A signed statement by a registered professional engineer that the
proposed plat or plan accounts for changes in the drainage of surface waters in
accordance with 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 205/2.
   (B)   Public health standards must be met for all floodplain development. In
addition to the requirements of sections
4-5-6 and
4-5-7 of this chapter, the following standards apply:
      1.   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a storage tank or floodproofed building
constructed according to the requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter.
      2.   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on site waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other aboveground openings
located below the flood protection elevation are watertight.
   (C)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. (Ord. 450, 11-4-
1996)
4-5-9: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board for a
variance. The zoning board shall review the applicant's request for a variance
and shall submit its recommendation to the city council. The city council may
attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to
further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety, or
creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other required local, state and federal permits have been
obtained.
   (B)   The zoning board shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance
from the requirements of the building protection standards of section
4-5-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair
or alteration of a site or building included on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places may be granted
using criteria more permissive than the requirements of subsections (A)1
through (A)5 of this section. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-10: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development, either inside or outside of the floodplain, will be
free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the
part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-11: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit for a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building inspector may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
building inspector shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city may make application to the circuit court for an injunction
requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court
deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than twenty five dollars ($25.00) nor more than two hundred
dollars ($200.00); and
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
   (B)   The building inspector shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)
4-5-12: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city council
to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program, including:
Ordinance 402 passed February 1, 1993. However, this chapter does not repeal
the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the
program, nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinance easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restriction shall prevail. (Ord. 450, 11-
4-1996)
4-5-13: SEPARABILITY:
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the
invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. (Ord. 450, 11-4-1996)

areas less than twenty (20) acres total may be used.
SAFE STORM DRAINAGE CAPACITY: The quantity of storm water runoff that can be
transported within a channel, passage, conduit, tube, duct, or combination
thereof in such a manner that the elevation of the water does not rise
sufficiently above the level of the adjacent ground surface so as to cause
damage to structures or facilities located thereon.
SITE: A lot or parcel of land, or a contiguous combination thereof, where
grading work is performed as a single unified operation.
SITE DEVELOPMENT: Altering terrain and/or vegetation and constructing driveways
and parking lots.
SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: A written document from the city authorizing
improvement exhibited in the site development plan and subject to the
conditions and restrictions contained therein.
SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Plan documents showing any proposed manmade changes to
improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, construction
of or substantial improvements to buildings or other structures, the placement
of mobile homes, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or
drilling operations.
STORM WATER RUNOFF: Water that results from precipitation which is not absorbed
by the soil or plant material.
STORM WATER RUNOFF RELEASE RATE: The rate at which storm water runoff is
released from dominant to subservient land.
STORM WATER STORAGE AREA: Areas designated to store excess storm water runoff.
TRIBUTARY WATERSHED: All of the area that contributes storm water runoff to a
given point.
VACANT: Land on which there are no structures or only structures which are
secondary to the use or maintenance of the land itself.
VEGETATION REMOVAL: Cutting vegetation to the ground or stumps, complete
extraction, or killing by spraying.
WET BOTTOM STORM WATER STORAGE AREA: A facility that is designated to be
maintained as free water surface or pond and accumulates water only when excess
storm water runoff occurs. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-3: STORM WATER RUNOFF MANAGEMENT:
   (A)   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff shall
be required in combination for all commercial, industrial, institutional,
governmental, utility, or other developments and for residential developments
that contain an area in excess of two (2) acres.
   (B)   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff from
all developments described above, shall not exceed the existing safe storm
drainage capacity of the natural downstream outlet channel or storm sewer
system, or that amount of existing runoff from the parcel of land in a
vegetative condition, whichever is less. The final release rate shall not
exceed the existing rate for all recurrent storm events up to and including a
100-year storm event. The rate at which storm water runoff is delivered to an
existing city owned designated storm water storage area may be unrestricted,
but subject to prior city approval and agreement with city to purchase the
required storage.
   (C)   A storm sewer conveyance system shall be designed with adequate
capacity to convey through the development the storm water runoff from all
tributary upstream areas. The overland flow channel portion of this system
shall be designed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year storm
assuming all storm sewers are blocked and that the upstream areas are fully
developed and have been saturated with antecedent rainfall (AMC = 4). No
habitable structures shall be constructed within this channel; however, streets
and parking or playground areas and utility easements shall be considered
compatible uses. Design of this floodway system shall also take into
consideration control of storm water velocity to prevent erosion or other
damage to the facility which will restrict its primary use. Depths of flow
shall be kept to a minimum and retention of channel configurations shall be
totally under city control. In the event that the area within this channel is
reshaped or restricted for use as a floodway, the city may cause to have any
restrictions removed at the expense of the party or parties causing said
restrictions. Should the development contain an existing natural waterway this
land configuration shall be preserved as part of the channel system.
Construction of a low flow system of storm sewers to carry the minor storm
runoff and reshaping of the channel with a maximum of four horizontal to one
vertical (4:1) side slopes and bottom of a width adequate to facilitate
maintenance and carry the flood runoff without eroding velocities may be
required in the plans for land development.
   (D)   The required volume for storm water detention shall be calculated on
the basis of the runoff from a 100-year frequency rainfall for a twenty four
(24) hour duration as published by the recognized agency. This volume of
storage shall be provided for the duly developed watershed that is tributary to
the area designed for detention purposes. The storm water release rate shall be
considered when calculating the storm water storage capacity and the control
structure designed to maintain a relatively uniform flow rate regardless of the
depth of storm water in the storage area.
   (E)   Dry bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will
not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. A method of
carrying the low flow through these areas shall be provided in addition to a
system of drains, and both shall be provided with a positive gravity outlet to
a natural channel or storm sewer with adequate capacity as described below. The
combination of storage of the water from a 100-year storm and the design
release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of seventy two
(72) hours. Maximum depth of planned storm water storage shall not exceed four
feet (4') unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend
to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the city. Minimum grades
for turf areas shall be one percent (1%) and maximum slopes shall be ten
percent (10%) (10 units horizontally to 1 unit vertically). Storage area side
slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land contours as practical and a
ten percent (10%) slope or less shall be used wherever possible. If slopes
greater than ten percent (10%) are necessary to meet storage requirements or
area restrictions, approval shall be obtained from the city and suitable
erosion control provided in addition to the protection required to ensure
public health, safety and welfare. Outlet control structures shall be designed
as simply as possible and shall require little or no attention for proper
operation. Each storm water detention area shall be provided with a method of
emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year
frequency storm occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to
function without attention and shall become part of the natural or surface
channel system described below. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to
substantiate all design features. Both outlet control structures and emergency
overflow facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the
public health, safety and welfare. Storm water runoff velocities shall be kept
at a minimum and turbulent conditions at an outfall control structure will not
be permitted without complete protection for the public safety. The use of
restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort
when no other method is feasible.
   (F)   Wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed with all of the
items required for dry bottom storm water storage areas, except that a low flow
conduit and a system of drains with a positive gravity outlet shall be
eliminated. However, the following additional conditions shall be complied
with:
      1.   Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave
action.
      2.   Minimum normal water depth shall be five feet (5'). If fish are to
be used to keep the pond clean, a minimum of one-fourth (1/4) of the pond area
shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') deep.
      3.   Facilities shall be available to allow the pond level to be lowered
by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance and public
safety. If a positive gravity outlet is not provided by the developer, the
developer may be required to provide a pumping system to be approved by the
city for the above purpose.
      4.   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed to
operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level.
Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features.
      5.   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided.
Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration
facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the
perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to
the satisfaction of the city.
      6.   In the event that the water surface of the pond is to be raised for
purposes of storing water for irrigation or in anticipation of the evapo-
transpiration demands of dry weather, the volume remaining for storage of
excess storm water runoff shall still be sufficient to contain the 100-year
storm runoff.
   (G)   Paved surfaces that are to serve as storm water storage areas shall
have minimum grades of one-half percent (1/2%) for PCC concrete and one percent
(1%) for asphalt and shall be restricted to storage depths of one foot (1')
maximum. Rooftop storage shall be designed with permanent type control inlets
and parapet walls to contain runoff on the rooftop. Emergency overflow areas
shall be provided to ensure that the weight of water stored will not exceed the
structural capacity of the roof. Release rates and storage volume requirements
for paved storage areas remain the same as outlined above. If a portion of an
area within a storm water storage area is to be paved for parking or recreation
purposes, the paved surface shall be placed at the highest elevation within the
storage areas as possible. Maximum parking lot grades shall not exceed normal
design parameters of three to five percent (3–5%).
   (H)   Where developments form only a portion of a watershed or contain
portions of several watersheds, the requirement for providing storage shall be
based upon the proportion of the area being developed as compared to the total
watershed tributary to the storage area. Compensating storage will be
acceptable only when approved by the city. As a watershed is developed with a
series of storm water storage facilities, due consideration will be given for
calculation of the allowable release rate and capacity of the natural or
surface channel system described above.
   (I)   Plans, specifications and all calculations for storm water runoff
control as required hereunder shall be submitted to the city for review and
approval prior to the approval of a final plat, in the case of subdivision,
mobile home parks and planned unit developments, or issuance of a building
permit, in the case of commercial or industrial construction.
   (J)   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm water
runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earth moving or drainage
construction on the project site.
   (K)   The construction of the storm water control system shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide benefits to the city, negotiations for
public participation in the cost of development may be feasible.
   (L)   The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity
of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the storm water runoff
shall give consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for
the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved
and roofed over. Specific design calculations and details shall be provided
with the final plans and specifications presented for city review. The use of
natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of storm runoff storage area,
the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention of existing topography are
examples of possible recharge methods.
   (M)   During the construction phases of land development, facilities shall
be provided to prevent the erosion and washing away of the earth. Silting of
downstream areas can be prevented through the strategic use of silting basins,
sodding of runoff channels, and by limiting the period of time during which the
earth is stripped of vegetation.
   (N)   Final engineering plans shall show complete details for all of the
items covered in this chapter and shall be submitted for review and approved by
the city council prior to the start of construction. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-4: GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
The following general principles shall apply to any movement of earth and any
sedimentation and erosion control plan and the granting of a permit for the
execution of said plan as hereinafter provided:
   (A)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any given time
during development.
   (B)   Such minimum area exposure shall be kept to as short a duration of
time as is practical.
   (C)   Temporary vegetation or, where appropriate, mulching or other
nonviable cover shall be used to protect areas exposed during development.
   (D)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps shall

Specifications For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control", latest edition, are
hereby incorporated into this chapter and made a part hereof by this reference,
for purposes of exemplifying the considerations and factors which should enter
into the preparation of a site development plan. All mandatory requirements of
the above listed standards shall be met. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-7: BUILDING PERMIT:
No building permit shall be issued for an intended building unless the proposed
drainage, earthwork and other improvements are in conformance with the site
development plan approved previously or as a part of the application for
building permit. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-8: APPEALS:
The applicant, as well as any person aggrieved, may appeal the decision of the
building inspector. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an appeal, the
zoning board of appeals shall schedule and hold a public hearing. The zoning
board of appeals shall render a decision within fifteen (15) days of the
hearing. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but not be limited
to, possible saturation of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and
domestic, runoff surface waters that produce erosion, and silting of
drainageways; nature and type of soil or rock that when disturbed by the
proposed grading may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be
landscaped, and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape
through grading or removal of vegetation. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-9: RESPONSIBILITY:
Failure of the city officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend denial of the site development permit, or of the
zoning board of appeals to deny said permit, shall not relieve the permittee
from responsibility of the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall
not result in the city, its officers or agents being responsible for any
condition or damage resulting therefrom. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-10: RETENTION OF PLANS:
Plans, specifications and reports for all site developments shall be retained
in original form or on microfilm by the building inspector. (Ord. 455, 4-21-
1997)
4-6-11: INSPECTIONS:
The building inspector shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall
either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee
wherein the same fails to comply with the site development plan. Where it is
found by inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated or shown in
the said plan, the building inspector may stop further work until approval is
obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the existing conditions.
Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of approval of the building
inspector, shall be maintained at the site during progress of the grading.
Until the final inspection is made, a sign issued by the city, indicating
permission to grade has been granted by the city, shall be prominently
displayed on the front property line of the property involved so as to be
visible from the street on which the property fronts. In order to obtain
inspections in accordance with the following schedule, the permittee shall
notify the building inspector at least two (2) full working days before the
said inspection is to be made:
   (A)   Rough Grading: When all rough grading has been completed; and
   (B)   Final Inspection: When all work, including installation of all
drainage and other structures and required planting, has been completed. (Ord.
455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-12: RECORD DRAWINGS:
Upon completion of the improvements, the developer's engineer shall provide a
set of as built record plans to the building inspector along with a
certification that the completed improvements generally conform to the
previously approved plans, specifications and reports included in section
4-6-6 of this chapter. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-13: NEIGHBORHOOD DRAINAGE PLANNING/SUBDIVISION PLATS:
Before approval of the final plat, the developer shall submit to the city
planning commission for their approval, a neighborhood drainage plan showing,

subdivisions and proposed first floor elevation for commercial and industrial
subdivisions.
   (D)   Proposed storm sewers with their sizes, slopes, number and type of
inlets, etc.
   (E)   Storm water storage facilities accompanied by design calculations and
design details for all of the above. Before occupancy permit can be granted,
all indicated floor elevations and lot surface elevations shall coincide with
approved proposed elevations previously submitted above. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-14: OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Applicability: All earth moving and grading operations not
specifically exempted by the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the
applicable standards and requirements set forth in this section, in addition to
the other requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Handbooks Adopted By Reference: The standards and specifications of
"Erosion And Sediment Control Handbook, Kankakee County, Illinois", latest
edition, as compiled by the Kankakee County soil and water conservation
district and approved by the Kankakee County regional planning commission and
the Illinois environmental protection agency's "Standards And Specifications
For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control", latest edition, are hereby incorporated
into this section and made a part hereof by this reference, for the purpose of
delineating procedures and methods of operation under development plans
approved in section
4-6-4 of this chapter. In the event of conflict between provisions of the said
handbooks and other provisions of this chapter, the more stringent requirements
shall govern.
   (C)   Special Precautions:
      1.   If at any stage of the grading the building inspector determines by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way,
watercourse or drainage structure, the building inspector may require, as a
condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable safety
precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the likelihood of such
peril. Special precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying
a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities,
berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for
erosion control, and reports of a registered engineer whose recommendations may
be made requirements for further work.
      2.   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take
such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property for the
public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail,
the building inspector may specify the time of starting grading and time of
completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages
so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the
advent of seasonal rains.
   (D)   Expiration Of Permit: Every site development permit shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has
not been commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days, or is not completed
within two hundred forty (240) days from date of issue; except that the
building inspector may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence
that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed within
the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written
application is made before the expiration date of the said permit. (Ord. 455,
4-21-1997)
4-6-15: FEES AND BONDS:
   (A)   Fees: Filing and permit fees shall be set forth in the applicable
sections of this code and amendments thereto, including the subdivision
ordinance and the building code.
   (B)   Bonds: Upon approval of a site development plan or building permit
within the purview of this chapter, the developer shall post a performance bond
payable to the city, cashier's check, negotiable securities or establish an
escrow account in the amount of the estimated total cost of the site
development hereunder, as approved by the city, to insure timely satisfactory
site development. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-16: APPEALS AND VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Review And Appeal: The building inspector is hereby authorized and
directed to enforce all the provisions of this chapter. Upon review of property
subject to this chapter, such officer may require, by written thirty (30) day
notice, that such property be brought into compliance with this chapter. Any
person aggrieved by such determination may appeal such to the zoning board of
appeals of the city under the rules of that board.
   (B)   Variations: The zoning board of appeals may authorize variations to
any of the requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter.
      1.   Application For Variation: Application for any variation shall be
made by a verified petition of applicant stating fully the grounds of the
application and of the facts relied upon by the petitioner. For the variation
to be granted, it shall be necessary that the zoning board of appeals find all
of the following facts with respect thereto:
         (a)   The land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations or record that it
is impossible or impractical for the subdivider to comply with all of the
regulations of this chapter.
         (b)   The variation is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
a substantial property right of the petitioner.
         (c)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property.
      2.   Zoning Board Of Appeals: After public hearing thereon, the zoning
board of appeals, by resolution, may approve the site development permit
application with the variation and conditions it deems necessary or it may
disapprove such site development permit application and variation application,
or it may take such other action as is appropriate. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
4-6-17: REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
   (A)   Authority: In the event any person holding a site development permit
pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the permit, or conducts or
carries on said site development in such a manner as to materially adversely
affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the property of the said permittee, or conducts or carries on
said site development so that it is materially detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the
building inspector shall revoke or suspend the site development permit.
   (B)   Procedure For Revoking Site Development Permit: No site development
permit shall be permanently revoked or suspended until a hearing is held by the
board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall be served upon the
permittee, either personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested,

under contract with the city of Momence who suspects that a dog may be vicious
within the meaning of this chapter may conduct an investigation to determine
whether or not the dog has committed any act or displays any characteristics
which qualify it as a vicious dog. If upon the completion of such investigation

vicious dog. An appeal must be directed to the chief of police and must be
filed by the owner in the office of the police department or city hall within
seven (7) working days after receipt of the notice of determination which
identifies the dog as a vicious dog. Should the owner fail to appeal the
determination within seven (7) working days, the determination of the
investigating officer that the dog is a vicious dog shall become final. Upon
receipt of an appeal, the chief of police, or such person as the chief may
designate to act on the chief's behalf, shall convene a hearing for the purpose
of determining whether the dog in question is a vicious dog.
      3.   The hearing shall be held within no less than five (5) nor more than
ten (10) working days after the chief of police or his designee serves a notice
of the time, date and location of the hearing upon the owner of the allegedly
vicious dog. The hearing shall be conducted informally and shall remain open to
the public. At the hearing, the owner shall have the opportunity to present
evidence to explain why the dog should not be declared a vicious dog. The owner
shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel at the owner's expense.
The officer who made the initial determination that the dog is vicious, and any
other persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances, may be heard by
the chief of police or his designee and shall be subject to cross examination
by the owner or the owner's attorney. The chief or his designee shall decide
all issues for or against the owner of the dog regardless of whether the owner
appears at the hearing.
      4.   Within five (5) working days after the conclusion of the hearing,
the chief of police or his designee shall determine whether or not the dog is a
"vicious dog" within the meaning of this chapter. The chief or his designee
shall notify the owner in writing of its determination. The decision of the
chief or his designee shall be final.
      5.   If any officer of the city of Momence determines that the public
safety requires the immediate impoundment of a dog as authorized by this
chapter, the officer shall within a reasonable time notify the owner of the
facts and circumstances relating to the impoundment. Upon receipt of such
notification, the owner may appeal the determination of the officer to the
chief of police or his designee in accordance with the procedures established

in any part of a house or structure that would allow the vicious dog to exit
the structure on its own volition. No vicious dog shall be kept in a house or
structure when the windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are
the only obstacles preventing the vicious dog from exiting the structure.

leash. The run line should be in the back yard and is not allowed in a front
yard.

police officer reasonably believes that such dog poses an immediate threat of
severe injury to any person, such officials are authorized to kill such dog.
Any vicious dog found to be running at large by any member of the police
department of a municipality shall be presumed to be in violation of this

which shall have bitten or otherwise injured any person so as to cause an
abrasion of the skin shall be immediately taken, impounded and kept separated
from other animals for fourteen (14) days. If, during that period, such animal
develops symptoms of illness, a veterinarian shall be called to diagnose its
condition.
If the symptoms disclosed are such as to indicate the presence of rabies, such
animal shall be destroyed in such manner, to detach and preserve intact the
head, which shall immediately be sent to the diagnostic laboratory of the
department of agriculture. In cases where such animal(s) cannot be safely taken
up and impounded, it may be terminated, care being taken to preserve the head
intact, and sent to the diagnostic laboratory of the department of agriculture.
      3.   Any dog which attacks a human being or other domestic animal may be
ordered destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner, when in the court's

beings or other domestic animals. However, prior to the destruction of the dog,
control of the dog must be transferred to the Kankakee County animal control
pursuant to subsection (C)2 of this section.

or other domestic animal without provocation, shall be ordered destroyed in an
expeditious and humane manner upon any subsequent violations of those
subsections or upon any subsequent unprovoked attack or bite.

When the chief of police of the city receives two (2) or more police reports

chief of police shall independently review such reports to determine whether
they describe criminal acts. Upon such findings, the chief may:
   (A)   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger

information:
      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
      2.   A statement that the chief of police has information that the
property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the
nuisance activities that may exist, or that have occurred. The chief of police
shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action
that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise
to the violation.
      3.   Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police
within ten (10) days to discuss the nuisance activities.
   (B)   After complying with the notification procedures described herein when
the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a
third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the
property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall:
      1.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been

         (d)   Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at
the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such
other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the
determination by the chief of police.
         (e)   A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such
address as shown on the tax rolls of the township in which the property is
located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons
are different than the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or
by first class mail, postage prepaid.

ten (10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the

may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this chapter.
      2.   If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the city pursuant to this chapter, a person in charge stipulates
with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a course of
action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the
violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a
period of not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days, except in the

result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning
abatement is reached within thirty (30) days, the chief of police shall request
authorization for the corporation counsel to commence a legal proceeding to
abate the nuisance.
      3.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the
chief of police shall send copies of the notice, as well as, any other
documentation which supports legal proceedings to the corporation counsel.
   (C)   When a person in charge makes a response to the chief of police as

activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the
exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for any
other purpose. (Ord. 470, 11-16-1998)

shall have the initial burden of showing by preponderance of the evidence that
the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   (B)   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance
property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in
the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had
become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of
reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that
the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   (C)   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court
may consider any of the following factors if they need be found appropriate,

mitigate or correct the problem at the property.

   (A)   In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate
threat to the public safety and welfare, the city may apply to the court for
such interim relief, as is deemed by the chief of police to be appropriate. In
such an event, the notification provision set forth in section
5-6-5 of this chapter need not be complied with, however, the city shall make a
diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing.
   (B)   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic
nuisance property" as defined in this chapter, the court may order the remedy
set out above. In addition, in the event that it also finds the person in
charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting
or violating this chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may
assess a civil fine as provided above.
   (C)   The court may authorize the city to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court. In the event that the city is authorized to secure the
property, all costs reasonably incurred by the city to effect a closure shall
be made and assessed as a lien against the property. If used herein, "costs"
mean those costs actually incurred by the city for the physical securing of the
property, as well as, tenant relocation costs.
   (D)   The city effecting the closure shall prepare a statement of cost and
the city shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If
no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court,
a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property.
   (E)   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by
the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the city.
   (F)   A tenant is entitled to their reasonable relocation costs, as those
are determined by the court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into
the property, after either:
      1.   The owner or tenant received notice as described herein of the
police chief's determination as described above.
      2.   Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to this section.
      3.   Any person who is assessed with costs of closure and/or civil
penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the
city. (Ord. 470, 11-16-1998)

If any provision of this chapter or its application, or any person or
circumstances held to be invalid for any reason, the remainder of said
application of its provisions to the other persons or circumstances shall not
be in any way affected. (Ord. 470, 11-16-1998)

6-6-1-1: ENACTMENT:
Pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act of 1970, as
amended, and in accordance with Illinois Municipal Code, this chapter, hereby
known as Sewer Use and Pretreatment Ordinance, is enacted by the City Council
of the City of Momence. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-1-2: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works (POTW) for the City of Momence, hereafter referred to
interchangeably as the City, without regard to the stage of the POTW or
discharge process at which the wastewater of the user enters the POTW. This
chapter provides for the use of public and private sewers and drains, private
sewage disposal, and authorizes the installation and continuing of connections
into the sewage works of the City upon certain conditions, including permission
thereof; providing for the installation and maintenance of such connections and
enforcements thereto; regulating the use of municipal and private sewers and
drains; individual wastewater disposal, the installation, connection and
disconnection of building sewers, the discharge of water and waste in the
public sewer system providing for penalties for violation therefore; and
providing for penalties for violation thereof; and providing for termination of
permits issued by the City pursuant to the provisions hereof.
This chapter enables the City to comply with all applicable State and Federal
laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and
general pretreatment regulations of 40 CFR Part 403. Additional objectives of
this chapter are:
   (A)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
   (B)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will pass
through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   (C)   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by air, wastewater
and bio-solids in the course of their employment and the general public;
   (D)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and bio-solids
from the POTW;
   (E)   To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, bio-solids use and disposal
requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to which the POTW is subject;
   (F)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW;
   (G)   To provide uniform requirements for Food Service Establishments (FSE)
for the control of grease discharge to the sanitary sewer system; and
   (H)   To regulate private wastewater disposal systems.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW and provides for the
enforcement of general requirements for users. The ordinance authorizes the
issuance of wastewater connection and discharge permits; provides for
monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative
review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the programs
established herein. The ordinance authorizes the issuance of wastewater
discharge permits that do not allow the discharge of defined process waste
streams but continue to allow the discharge of domestic or sanitary wastewater.

MITIGATION FEE: impossible or impracticable. The Grease Mitigation Fee is intended to cover the costs
                of the increased maintenance of the sewer system for inspection and cleaning of FOG and
                other viscous or solidifying agents that a properly employed grease control device
                would otherwise prevent from entering the sewer system.
HAULED WASTE:   Sanitary or process wastewater transported as a commercial venture. Hauled waste is
                prohibited to be discharged at the POTW.
HOT SPOTS:      Areas in the sewer lines that have experienced sanitary sewer overflows or that must be
                cleaned and maintained frequently to avoid blockages of the sewer system.

SOURCE:
                (A)   Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is (or may
                be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced after the
                publication of proposed pretreatment standards under Section 307 (c) of the Act which
                will be applicable to such source if such standards are thereafter promulgated in
                accordance with that section, provided that one of the following is true:
                   1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at a site on
                which no other source is located;
                   2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces the process
                or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source;
                or
                   3.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the building, structure,
                facility, or installations are substantially independent of an existing source at the
                same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such as
                the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the
                extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the
                existing source, should be considered.
                (B)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a
                modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new
NEW SOURCE:     building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of Section (A)2. or
                3. above but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or production
                equipment.
                (C)   Construction of a new source as defined under this paragraph has commenced if the
                owner or operator has done one of the following:
                   1.   Begun, or caused one of the following to begin as part of a continuous onsite
                construction program:
                      (a)   Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment; or
                      (b)   Significant site preparation work including, clearing, excavation, or
                removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary for the
                placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or equipment; or
                   2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities or
                equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable time.
                Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without
                substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do not
                constitute a contractual obligation under this paragraph.
                (D)   New Sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall "start-up”
                all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards
                before beginning to discharge.

6-6-3-2: PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL:
No person shall construct a wastewater treatment facility within the corporate
limits of the City or in any area under the jurisdiction of the City for the
purpose of treating wastewater and discharging same to a water course unless
the following provisions are met.
   (A)   For the purpose of treating non-residential source wastes, the
Kankakee County Health Department determines that the wastewater treatment
facilities have inadequate capacity, and issues a permit for the construction
and operation of a wastewater treatment facility. No City permit shall become
effective until:
      1.   The CE has approved the plans and specifications in writing,
      2.   Approval has been obtained from the Kankakee County Department of
Health, as appropriate,
      3.   An IEPA permit issued to construct the facility has been received,
      4.   An IEPA NPDES permit to operate the facility has been issued and
received,
      5.   The installation is completed to the satisfaction of the CE, and
      6.   The final inspection has been completed.
Persons operating a wastewater treatment facility shall file copies of all
operating reports sent to the USEPA and IEPA with the CE and such other reports
as the CE deems necessary.
   (B)   Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of
Section
6-6-3-1 and the wastewater source to be treated is domestic in nature, the
building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system employing
subsurface absorption facilities.
No person shall construct a private wastewater treatment facility with
subsurface disposal without previous approval from the CE. If approval is given
the person must adhere to the following limitations.
      1.   Permit Requirements
         (a)   Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal
system the owner shall first obtain a written permit signed by the
Superintendent. The application for such permit shall be made on a form
furnished by the City which the applicant shall supplement by any plans,
specifications and other information as deemed necessary by the City. A permit
and inspection fee as required by the Kankakee County Health Department shall
be paid to the County at the time the application is filed. The permit shall
not be issued until applicable State and County permits are obtained.
         (b)   The type, capacities, location and layout of a private sewage
disposal system shall comply with all regulations and provisions of the State
of Illinois Private Sewage Disposal Licensing Act and Code, with the State of
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Kankakee County Health
Department, latest revision. No permit shall be issued for any private sewage
disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area
of the lot is less than 160,000 square feet. No septic tank or cesspool shall
be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
         (c)   A permit for a private Sewage disposal system shall not become
effective until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent. The City shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of
construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the
City when the work is ready for final inspection, and before any underground
portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within 48 hours of the
receipt of written notice by the City, except that no inspections will be made
at any time other than regular City working hours.
   (C)   Where development is possible but gravity sewers and conventional
sewer systems are not practical.
Accordingly, it is the policy of the City to approve grinder pump systems on a
discretionary case-by-case basis. In order to implement a grinder pump system,
a developer or individual homeowner must prove to the City that a grinder pump
system is the only viable option other than a conventional Sanitary Sewer
system. A permit and inspection fee as published in Section
7-6-4 shall be paid to the City at the time the application is filed. A permit
for a private Wastewater treatment facility employing a grinder pump system
shall not be issued until the design and installation is completed to the
satisfaction of the City.
      1.   Installation: The City shall be allowed to inspect the work at any
stage of the construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall
notify the Plumbing Inspector when the grinder pump system is ready for final
inspection, and before any underground portions are covered.
      2.   Operation and Maintenance: The Plumbing Inspector or his designee
shall be entitled to inspect the grinder pump system if said Plumbing Inspector
has any reason to believe that the grinder pump system is not operating
properly or pursuant to a routine inspection protocol developed by the Plumbing
Inspector. Should the grinder pump system fall into disrepair or otherwise need
maintenance as determined by the City, and the owner refuses to repair, replace
or otherwise fix the grinder pump system to the specifications of the City, the
City may do so at its own expense and obtain reimbursement from the individual
owner. In that regard, and as a condition of obtaining a City permit for a
grinder pump system, the individual owner shall enter into a contractual
agreement indemnifying the City for any costs the City may incur with regards
to maintaining the grinder pump system, and further allow the City reasonable
access to the grinder pump system for inspection purposes.
   (D)   Other provisions.
      1.   The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal
facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, and at no expense to the City.
      2.   As provided in Section
6-6-3-2.B, at such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property
served by a private sewage disposal system, a direct connection shall be made
to the public sewer within upon request by City. Any septic tanks, cesspools
and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be cleaned of bio-solids
and filled with suitable material such as clean bank-run gravel or dirt.
      3.   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to
interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Kankakee
County Department of Health as appropriate. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-3-3: BUILDING SEWER AND CONNECTIONS:
   (A)   Permit Requirements. No Person shall construct a new wastewater source
and connect same to the POTW of the City without first making application for
the privilege of making said connection to the City.
      1.   No unauthorized Person shall uncover, make any connections with, or
opening into; use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the City, with sign-off by the
Superintendent and receipt of an IEPA permit when required under 35 IAC 309.
      2.   No addition to or alteration of any building sewer shall be made or
caused to be made by any person without a permit from the City and then only
through a sewer contractor. No permit shall authorize anything not explicitly
stated in the application.
      3.   No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which, in turn, is connected
directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any violation of this
section after ordinance adoption shall subject the violator to fines of $100.00
per day per violation. Each successive day (24 hour period) shall be considered
a separate violation.
      4.   All disposal by any person into the sewer system is unlawful except
those discharges in compliance with federal standards promulgated pursuant to
the Federal Act, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and regulations
promulgated thereto, and the City of Momence Municipal Code.
      5.   There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits as
designated below:
         (a)   Residential and commercial service, and
         (b)   Service establishments producing industrial wastes.
In either case, the owner and his agent shall make application on a special
form furnished by the City. The permit application shall be supplemented with
plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment
of the inspector. A permit and inspection fee as provided in Section
7-6-4 shall be paid to the City at the time the application is filed or prior
to receiving City sign-off for an IEPA permit in the case on an industrial
user.
Upon review of permit application, the Superintendent will determine the
reserve capacity of the sewer line in question and approve or reject the
application in view of the available sewer's load carrying capacity.
      6.   Persons desiring to construct a new waste source and connect it to
the POTW of the City shall state the quantity, quality and rate of discharge
into the sewer. The non-residential user, as a condition of permit
authorization, must provide information describing its wastewater constituents,
characteristics and type of activity per Section 7-6-4-1. In the case of any
fraudulent representation upon the part of the user, the permit fees will be
forfeited and the use of the sewer stopped.
      7.   A building sewer permit will only be issued and a sewer connection
shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewerage
facilities, including sewers, pump stations and POTW, have sufficient reserve
capacity to adequately and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste
load based on the population equivalent.
      8.   The applicant will secure a building permit if the waste source is
new equipment to be installed in an existing building with an existing sewer.
      9.   Each excavation for any of the purposes set out in this subsection
shall require a separate permit.
Any person who makes any excavation or does any work without first securing the
permit required by this subsection, upon conviction thereof, shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and, in addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter,
shall be liable for the penalties set forth in City Code.
      10.   All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The person installing the
building sewer for said owner shall be a plumber or sewer contractor and he
shall indemnify the City from loss or damage that may be directly or indirectly
be occasioned by said installation. Before a building sewer is issued, the
plumber or sewer contractor shall file with the City Clerk an indemnity bond in
the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), with corporate surety licensed
to do business in the State of Illinois, on bond forms supplied by the City. In
addition thereto, the plumber or sewer contractor shall file with the City
Clerk a certificate of insurance covering public liability insurance in the
amount of one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00/
$300,000.00) for bodily injury and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) covering
property damage.
      11.   The building permit will be issued for a period of 24 months
consistent with the IEPA permits.
   (B)   Building Sewer Connections:
      1.   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on
an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer and may be done only with the explicit
approval of the City. In no case shall any Owner be permitted to maintain,
without the consent of the City, any connection of a Building Drain to a
Building Sewer located across or under the property of another.
      2.   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test, to meet all requirements of
this chapter. A report shall be provided to the City by the applicant. All
costs for this examination shall be borne by the applicant.
      3.   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the
City. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the
American Society of Testing Materials, Water Pollution Control Federation
Manual of Practice No. 9, and Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction in Illinois shall apply.
      4.   No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within 3 feet of any
bearing wall. No building sewers shall be installed in any place where they may
be subject to freezing temperatures unless adequate provisions are made to
protect them from frost. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly
curbed pipe and fittings, or a manhole, as determined by the Superintendent.
      5.   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer. Where possible, all building sanitary services shall be
"overhead" installations. Buildings having basements will have a pump or
ejector provided to pump the wastewater to the sanitary sewer service for
gravity transport to the sewer main.
      6.   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
at an existing stub and conform to the requirements of the building and
plumbing code, or other applicable rules and regulations of the City, or the
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society of
Testing Materials, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9,
and Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois.
All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
If no stub is available, then a wye or tee shall be installed on the public
sanitary sewer by the user, at his expense, subject to inspection and approval
by the City.
   (C)   Construction Requirements. Construction may not be started until fees
are paid consistent with Section
6-6-3-4 and a written permit is issued by the City after issuance and receipt
of an IEPA permit for the project when applicable. The following conditions are
also required:
      1.   The applicant shall secure a street opening permit from the
Superintendent and pay a refundable deposit fee per Section
7-6-4 when appropriate in conformance with the provisions of the Building Code.
      2.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City. Failure to
properly barricade will be cause for the job site to be shut down and a fee as
provided in Section
7-6-4 must be paid before and proper barricades need to be provided and City
any further work can commence.
      3.   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of any underground
piping installation and when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of a qualified Duly Authorized Agent of the City during regular
City working hours.
      4.   Minimum building sanitary service sewer size shall be six-inch (6")
diameter. All cleanouts shall be installed on the owner's property and not in

includes but is not limited to inspections of sampling manholes, common
interceptors, flow metering or sampling equipment, garbage grinders, grease,
oil and sand interceptors, and grease interceptors. A separate review fee may
be charged based on the cost and expense to review equalization and/or
pretreatment facilities required at a non-residential user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-
2022)
6-6-3-5: USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged to any
facility served by the City, without having first complied with the terms of
this chapter. At minimum, all users are subject to the prohibited discharge
standards in Section
6-6-5-2, change notification in Section
6-6-9-6 and hazardous waste notification in Section
6-6-9-9 if applicable. Spill/Slug control planning may also be necessary for
some non-residential users as identified in Section
6-6-6-5.
   (B)   No user(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain, which in turn is connected
directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-3-6: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   (A)   An inspection fee as provided in Section
7-6-4 shall be paid to the City prior to issuance of the permit should it be
determined that the user is required to install any of the following
structures:
      1.   Sampling Manhole Requirements. All users located in areas zoned
industrial and/or business park and such other users as required by the
Superintendent, except residential users, are required to install a monitoring
manhole for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with
the plans and specifications approved by the Superintendent. Each manhole shall
be situated on the user's premises in an easement dedicated to the City.
The sampling manhole shall be located on the sewer connection pipe at a point
where there are no changes in grade or alignment for at least 15 pipe diameters
upstream and downstream from the manhole. The grade (slope) of the pipe shall
not exceed 1% (1 foot per 100 feet) through the manhole and for a distance of
15 pipe diameters upstream and downstream from the manhole.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The manhole shall be
installed and maintained by the owner/user at his sole expense so as to be safe
and accessible to the City at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to
claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
         (a)   Where such a manhole location would be impractical or cause
extreme hardship on the user, the Superintendent may concur with the manhole
being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the
manhole is located so that it shall not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. In those cases where a sampling manhole must be in a parking lot, a
permanent barricade, such as a vertical pipe shall be placed around the manhole
to prevent vehicles from driving or parking over the manhole cover.
         (b)   The Superintendent may postpone the installation of the sampling
manhole when specific circumstances prevent the installation of a manhole.
         (c)   A postponement for a sampling manhole will be handled on a case-
by-case basis by the Superintendent when it is determined that the discharge is
solely from a residential source and the site is not in a zoned business park/
industrial area.
         (d)   When a postponement for a sampling manhole installation is
granted by the City, an affidavit will be signed by the property owner to
install the manhole at a later date should business practices change at the
location where the manhole installation was postponed.
         (e)   The Superintendent may determine sub-classes of business that
need not install monitoring manholes. Monitoring manholes will always be
required in zoned business or industrial parks.
      2.   Liquid Quantity Measurements. All SIUs may be required to install an
open channel flow measuring device in said sampling manhole. When required, the
sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus or Parshall flume or equivalent,
unless a weir or similar device is approved by the City.
The City may, at its option, based on the water usage and/or waste loadings,
require the user to install a device with a recording and totalizing register
for measurement of the liquid quantity. The equipment required to indicate,
record and totalize the Flow shall be located in a warm dry location and be
accessible to the City for reading. This equipment shall be installed and
maintained by the user at his sole expense. Should the requirement be made, the
user shall complete installation of the flume and secondary flow measuring
device based on the installation schedule approved for such device by the City.
The user shall be required to calibrate and maintain the flow metering
equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures and
frequencies. Users who operate flow measuring devices will submit the procedure
for operation and maintenance (O & M) to the City. The user shall further
document O & M in a log which shall be available for inspection by City
personnel. At minimum, the user shall submit a calibration report performed by
an outside representative by the deadline defined in the user's discharge
permit. The user may be required to submit flow records to the Pretreatment
Coordinator monthly.
      3.   Sampling Equipment. The City may, at its option, based on water
usage and/or waste loadings or when the waste loads cannot be accurately
evaluated by time composite samples, require the user to install sampling
equipment. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at his
sole expense.
Users shall submit the procedure for operation and maintenance to the City. The
user shall further document O & M in a log, which shall be available for
inspection by City personnel. At minimum, the user shall submit an annual
report confirming the accurate operation of the equipment performed by an
outside representative by the deadline defined in the discharge permit. (Ord.
868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-3-7: ADDITIONAL STRUCTURES REQUIRED FOR THE USE OF THE PUBLIC SEWERS:
   (A)   An inspection fee as provided by Section
6-6-3-4 and found in Section
7-6-4 shall be paid to the City prior to issuance of the permit should it be
determined that the user is required to install any of the following
structures:
      1.   Garbage Grinders. Garbage is required to be properly shredded in
order to be approved to be discharged to the public sewer. Wastes classified as
properly shredded garbage contain all particles being carried freely under the
flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particle greater
than one-half inch (1.27 centimeters) in any dimension. The installation and
operation of any garbage grinder equipped, with a motor of three-fourths
horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to review and approval
of the City. The discharge of grinders is prohibited to be connected to a
grease interceptor.
      2.   Grease, Oil, and Sand Interceptors. Interceptors shall be provided
in services connected to the City where it is determined that they are
necessary for the proper handling of the wastewater containing excessive
amounts of grease, oil, and sand except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interception units
shall be of type and capacity approved by the City and shall be so located to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Oil and sand interceptors
used for petroleum grease and oils may be located inside the building. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the owner at his expense.
      3.   Neutralizing Basin. Laboratory and facilities commonly using acid or
alkaline chemicals or compounds must install a neutralizing basin. All basins
shall be of type and capacity approved by the City and shall be so located to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Equipment and devices installed under this section shall not be considered to
provide pretreatment to wastewater. Any user operating devices installed in
this section shall submit operating data as may be required by the City.
   (B)   Equalization and Pretreatment Equipment.
      1.   Approval. If the City requires the equalization or pretreatment of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the City, and, subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. Said facilities
shall also be subject to approval by IEPA consistent with IEPA regulations.
      2.   O & M. Where flow-equalizing or pretreatment facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-3-8: FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS:
   (A)   Grease and Interceptors - Food Service Establishments (FSE). Hydro-
mechanical grease interceptors and gravity grease interceptors (collectively
referred to as grease interceptors or GI) are required to be installed in all
new FSE. All GI shall be of a type and capacity approved by the City based on
an evaluation of the volume and characteristics of the discharge in conjunction
with the operating plan of the FSE. The City may require GI to be installed or
modified in an existing FSE where FSE that have caused or contributed to
overflows and/or blockages, or at existing FSE that that meet the remodeling
requirements identified in Section
6-6-3-8 or when streetscapes or street/sewer replacements are installed.
      1.   Installation Requirements.
         (a)    All newly constructed FSE's shall install an exterior GI prior
to operation of the facility.
         (b)   Common Interceptors are required to be installed when the
tenants or purchasers of sub-properties that are unknown by the complex owner
and zoning allows the build-out of an FSE in said properties. The owner of the
property on which the common interceptor is located shall be primarily
responsible for the maintenance, upkeep, and repair of the common interceptor.
         (c)   Existing FSE. All existing FSE's may be required to install a GI
at the request of the City. The City may require a GI to be installed or
modified in an existing FSE within ninety (90) calendar days of notification by
the City where:
            (1)   The FSE has caused or contributed to overflows and/or
blockages;
            (2)   When any reconstruction, rebuilding, or remodeling of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the building occurs; or
            (3)   When streetscapes or street/sewer replacements are installed.
The City may require a new GI to be installed when the existing facility has an
undersized, irreparable, or defective GI.
In the event that winter weather will impact the installation of a GI, the City
may grant an extension of the installation schedule to a maximum of one hundred
eighty (180) calendar days.
         (d)   Existing FSE where blockages typically occurred. GI's will be
required to be installed within ninety (90) calendar days of notification by
the City if blockages typically occur downstream of the FSE. GI's interior to
the building may be required as an interim measure to the installation of an
exterior GI. Interior GI will be required to be installed within from five (5)
to thirty (30) calendar days, as determined by the City based upon the nature
of the hot spot or blockage, after a notice by the City.
      2.   Location. All GI shall be located to be easily accessible for
cleaning, maintenance and inspection. All GI shall be provided exterior to the
building for all new construction and when feasible at existing FSE. The GI
shall not be located in drive-through lanes, paved over, covered with
landscaping, or have any other hindrances not allowing access.
      3.   An inspection fee found in Section
7-6-4 shall be paid to the City prior to issuance of the permit should it be
determined that the user is required to install any GI.
      4.    Sign-off Inspection. Prior to the initial operation of any FSE, the
GI shall be inspected by the City and a sign-off will be issued by the City.
Notification will be made by the FSE to the City during normal business hours
of the City. Inspections will be made normally by the City within two (2) City
business days of the notice. The FSE will be required to make appropriate
changes prior to initial operation, in the event that the GI does not meet
requirements.
      5.   Modifications. The City may make determinations of GI adequacy,
need, design, appropriateness, application, location, modification(s), and
conditional usage based on review of all relevant information regarding GI
performance, facility site and building plan review by all regulatory reviewing
agencies and may require repairs to, or modification or replacement of the GI.
      6.   Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan. In addition to installing a
GI, all FSEs that discharge to the sanitary sewer system are required to
prepare and implement a BMP plan as outlined in Section 7-6-6-4 to minimize the
amount of FOG discharged to the sanitary sewer.
      7.   All FSE may be issued a general permit as provided by Sections 7-6-
7 and 7-6-8.
   (B)   Grease Interceptor Criteria. GI installed at new and existing FSE must
meet the following criteria:
      1.   Sizing. GIs shall be designed in accordance with the City's most
recently adopted plumbing code. To calculate the appropriate GI size, the FSE's
engineer, licensed plumber or contractor shall use a formula that considers all
kitchen plumbing fixture units, the discharge plumbing pipe diameter for each
fixture unit, storage capacity, type of facility, and an adequate retention
time. The City will review the GI sizing calculation and will make a decision
to approve or require additional GI volume. Where sufficient capacity cannot be
achieved with a single unit, installation of GI in series is required.
      2.   Twenty-five Percent Requirement. Provide for a minimum hydraulic
retention time to facilitate the separation of oils and grease between the
influent and effluent baffles and prevent pass through of oils and grease from
the GI, with twenty-five percent (25%) of the total volume of the GI being
allowed for any food derived solids to settle or accumulate and floatable
grease-derived materials to rise and accumulate, identified as a solids blanket
and grease cap respectively.
      3.   Access Manholes. Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24
inches, shall be provided over each exterior GI chamber and each sanitary tee.
The access manholes shall extend one inch above finished grade to prevent storm
or surface water inflow or infiltration. One manhole shall be located above the
inlet tee and the other manhole shall be located above the outlet tee. The
manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection,
maintenance, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities. The manholes
shall be accessible for inspection by the City.
      4.   Plumbing Connections. All GI shall be installed in accordance with
the requirements contained in all applicable local plumbing codes. The GI shall
be located in the FSE's lateral sewer line between all fixtures which may
introduce grease into the City's wastewater collection system. Wastewater from
domestic facilities and other non-grease laden waste streams shall not be
connected to the GI.
      5.   Prohibitions. Dishwashers and food waste disposal units shall not be
connected to or discharged into any GI.
   (C)   Maintenance. Each FSE shall be solely responsible for the costs of
installing, inspecting, pumping, cleaning, maintaining, repairing and replacing
its GI. For GIs that serve multiple FSEs, then the property owner is the
responsible party.
      1.   Introduction of enzymes, emulsifiers, surfactants, solvents, hot
water or other agents into a grease interceptor to dissolve or emulsify grease
or as a grease abatement method is prohibited. Introduction of bacteria,
caustics or acids as a grease degradation agent is permitted with prior written
approval by the City.
      2.   All GIs shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content
as required in order to maintain the design capability or effective volume. The
GI cleaning frequency shall be determined based on the Twenty-five Percent
Rule, which is when the sum of the grease layer and the solids layer is at 25%
of the tank depth volume. At no time shall the cleaning frequency exceed three
months. The entire contents of the GI must be cleaned annually and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense. It shall be the
responsibility of the FSE to inspect its GI during the pumping procedure to
ensure the GI is properly cleaned out and that all fittings and fixtures inside
the GI are in working condition and functioning properly. The return of the
water pumped from the GI back into the GI or into the City's wastewater
collection system is prohibited.
      3.   In the event that actual operations of the GI fail to produce
results that consistently prevent prohibitive discharges as defined in Section
6-6-5-2, the owner of the FSE will be required by the City to have the GI
cleaned at a more frequent rate or install additional pretreatment as
necessary.
      4.   The FSE must have documentation consisting of inspection, cleaning,
and maintenance logs on site in accordance with and demonstrating compliance
with this regulation and must be able to produce the documentation immediately
upon request by the City.
      5.   The FSE shall notify the City by phone or email within one business
day (Monday-Friday) or any noted deficiencies encountered while performing GI
pumping, cleaning or maintenance.
      6.   Disposal. It is the responsibility of each FSE or property owner to
ensure that wastes removed from each GI are properly disposed of at a facility
permitted to receive such wastes.
   (D)   Private Sewer Line Cleaning. Any grease waste hauler, plumber or
contractor that cleans FOG from a FSE's private sewer line must insure that the
FOG and other debris cleaned from the private sewer line does not cause an
obstruction or blockage in the City's sanitary sewer system. Therefore, the FOG
or other debris cleaned from the private sewer line must be removed and hauled
off-site. The City shall be contacted immediately if FOG is pushed or jetted
into the City sanitary sewer system to make the City aware of the FOG and
debris at the specific location.
   (E)   All FSEs that produce yellow grease shall recycle it in an approved
grease recycling container, which has a tight-fitting lid and secondary
containment, and shall be handled by a licensed recycling company. Yellow
grease shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer line, GI, storm sewer or
into the environment whereas to be conveyed to a waterway. The lids to the
yellow grease container shall remain closed when stored outside. Spilled yellow
grease outside shall be cleaned up immediately and disposed of properly.
Washing of yellow grease to the storm sewer or waterway is prohibited.
   (F)   Inspections. The City may inspect FSEs at any time during normal
business hours in order to verify continued compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations. FSEs with GIs that are inaccessible to the City are
responsible for having staff readily available during any inspection to provide
access to and to open and close the GI.
   (G)   Waivers that are available to FSE are identified below. A request for
a waiver is required to be filed with the City on a form provided by the City
and a waiver review fee will be required at the time of the filing as defined
in Section
7-6-4. Waiver requests are not considered to be filed until the request has
been reviewed and determined complete. If the City fails to act on a completed
waiver request within 45 calendar days, a request for waiver shall be deemed to
be denied. While waivers may result in an alteration of the GI requirements, it
does not waive the requirement to prevent prohibitive discharges through
alternate technologies and best management plan practices.
      1.   Existing External FSE GI Installation Waiver. The requirement to
install and to properly operate and maintain a GI is conditionally stayed, that
is, delayed in its implementation by the City. Terms and conditions for
application of a stay to a FSE shall be set forth in a permit. The terms may
include the requirement to install GI(s) inside the facility, alternate
technology and/or the use of best management practices. The waiver will not
apply to any existing facility that has not operated as a FSE for the last 12
consecutive months prior to the adoption of this chapter. Such facilities will
be required to install a GI in order to operate as a FSE in the City sanitary
sewer service area.
      2.   Common GI Waiver. Common GI means one or more interceptors receiving
FOG laden wastewater from more than one FSE. Common interceptors may be used in
lieu of individual GI at each FSE provided a waiver has been granted by the
City. A common GI may be located at shopping centers, malls, entertainment
complexes, sporting arenas, hotels, multi-tenant "flex" spaces, mixed use
spaces, and other sites where multiple establishments are connected to a single
GI. The owner of the property on which the common GI is located shall be
responsible for operating and maintenance of the common GI including program
documentation, upkeep, and repair. In such cases, a permit will be issued to
the property owner for the GI and general permits will also be required at each
FSE for best management practices requirements.
      3.   Constraint Waivers at Existing FSE. Where the installation of a GI
is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, a
waiver from the installation of the GI requirement may be granted. The City
determination to grant the waiver will be based upon, but not limited to,
evaluation of the following conditions:
         (a)   There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance
of a GI;
         (b)   There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between the kitchen
plumbing fixtures and the GI and/or between the GI and the private collection
lines or public sewer; or
         (c)   There is no alternative pretreatment technology that is, at
least, equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a GI.
If a Constraint Waiver is granted, the City will institute the Grease Disposal
Mitigation Fee as defined in Section
7-6-4.
      5.   Alternate Technology Waiver. The use of automatic grease removal
systems is permissible only upon the written approval of the City, the lead
plumbing inspector of the City, and the Kankakee County Health Department.
Approval of the device shall be based on demonstrated (proven) removal
efficiencies and reliability of operation. The City may approve these types of
devices dependent on manufacturer's specifications on a case by case basis. Any
user operating an alternative technology may be subject to additional
operational requirements. Any user with this equipment shall operate the system
in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as
measured from the unit's outlet, is consistent achieved as required by the
Superintendent.
      6.   Cleaning Cycle Waiver. The property may petition the Pretreatment
Coordinator to reduce the cleaning and servicing of the GI from every three
months to a maximum of every six months upon demonstration that the amount
removed every three months is significantly less than twenty-five percent (25%)
rule for the basin capacity and the discharge does not exceed the oil and
grease local limit. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-3-9: SEWER LINE MAINTENANCE/REPLACEMENT:
   (A)   The property owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of
the private sewer line from their structure to the main sewer or public sewer
including the tap into the main/public sewer.
   (B)   In the event the property owner finds it necessary to excavate the
private sewer line for maintenance or replacement that shall be the property
owner's responsibility.
   (C)   In those instances when property owners have had to excavate and as a
result the sidewalk, curb and street have been dug out, the property owner will
be responsible for the restoration of the street (surface and sub-surface) curb
and sidewalk.
   (D)   In those instances where Subsection C above is involved, it is
recommended tunneling under the curb and sidewalk whenever practical. Sidewalk
and curb must be cut when removal is required.
   (E)   All work, as it is related to the replacement and/or repair of the
private sewer line, shall be in conformance with the City standard construction
specifications and will be inspected by a duly authorized agent of the City
during the repair and replacement. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-3-10: AUTOMOBILE SERVICE, REPAIR AND FUEL DISPENSING PROPERTIES:
   (A)   When property use involves automotive repair or handling, sale and
dispensing of petroleum products and/or automotive fluids, all discharges shall
have installed a sampling manhole consistent with the requirements of Section
6-6-3-6. All sampling manholes of this type shall be monitored throughout the
year in a manner secured and coordinated by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
Additionally, any property involved in the repair or servicing of automobiles,
trucks, or engine-powered equipment shall install a triple basin oil separator
in the sanitary line (per State of Illinois Plumbing codes) servicing the
repair area of the building. This system shall be cleaned, serviced and
inspected at least four times per year by the owner at his expense. The
property may petition the Pretreatment Coordinator to reduce the cleaning and
servicing of the triple basin oil separator to two times per year upon
demonstration that the amount removed quarterly is significantly less than 25%
rule for the basin capacity and the discharge does not exceed the oil and
grease local limit. Conversely, the system may be required by the Pretreatment
Coordinator to be cleaned at a more frequent rate if the property cannot meet
the requirements.
   (B)   When property use involves automotive repair or handling, sale and
dispensing of petroleum products and/or automotive fluids, there shall be a
separate drainage system constructed to collect all fluids from the areas
associated with pump islands and under pump canopies. This separate drainage
system shall collect these fluids and hold them in a separate sealed tank for
testing and removal by approved special waste handling methods. All fuel

polluting substances, to any storm sewer or storm water drainage system within
the corporate limits of the City.
      2.   Discharge of Sanitary and Industrial Waste into Storm Drainage
Systems Prohibited, Nuisance Declared. For reasons of the protection of the
health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the City, is the declared
policy of the City to prohibit sanitary and industrial waste from entering into
the storm water drainage system, and any such connection to the storm water
drainage system is determined to be injurious to the public health and welfare
and is hereby declared a public nuisance.
      3.   Prohibited Discharges into Natural Outlets. It shall be unlawful to
discharge into any natural outlet within the City or in any area under the
jurisdiction of the City, any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes or other
polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in
accordance with subsequent provisions of this chapter and the required permits

   (F)   Requirements of Unpolluted Discharges
      1.   Discharge of Sump Pumps. A sump pump or sump pumps must discharge
into a storm sewer system; or with the prior written permission of the
Superintendent may discharge outside a building in an area first approved by
the Superintendent. A shut-off value or similar device which can divert the
unpolluted discharge from the sump pump into the sanitary sewer system, rather
than into the storm system, or vice versa, shall not be constructed or
installed, and any construction or installation of same shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter. It shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of
this chapter if any person or user has on his premises or under his control a
sump pump, or any other pump, fixture, or gravity drain connected to the
sanitary sewer system which would allow the flow of unpolluted water into the
sanitary sewer system.
      2.   Discharge of Unpolluted Drainage into Storm Sewers or Natural
Outlets. Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural
outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling waters or unpolluted

IEPA if appropriate, to a storm sewer or natural outlet. Discharges are
required to be in compliance with the Clean Water Act.
      3.   Discharge of Unpolluted Discharges Upon Adjacent Property or Public
Streets or Ways Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person or user to
discharge any storm water, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, or
subsurface drainage, including the use of a sump pump for such purpose in such
manner as to cause waters to overflow onto adjacent property or to be
discharged upon any public street or public way. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-5-3: NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
These pretreatment requirements shall apply to all non-residential users
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, promulgated by the
USEPA in accordance with Section 307(b) and (c) of the Act, currently
discharging or scheduled to discharge to the City. The national categorical
pretreatment standards, found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 -
471 are hereby incorporated into this chapter.
Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from
the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the
standard. Compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards is
mandatory.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with paragraphs B and F below and 40 CFR 403.6(c) unless
specifically restricted by the categorical pretreatment standard. These
equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements
are deemed pretreatment standards. Users shall be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived. An alternative pretreatment
limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical
detection limit for any of the regulated Pollutants. [Optional Streamlining
provision.]
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either
as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes
of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users.
The City calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall calculate such
limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the user's average
rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not upon the
designed production capacity, but rather upon a reasonable measure of the
user's actual long-term daily production during a representative year. For new
sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.
The City calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall calculate such
limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average daily flow rate of
the user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate must be
based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term average flow
rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Pretreatment
Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters
to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance
of an alternative limit.
   (D)   A user may request a variance from categorical pretreatment standards
from USEPA based on fundamentally different factors. The request must comply
with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
   (E)   A user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   (F)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the City convert the limits
to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to
mass limits is within the discretion of the Pretreatment Coordinator. The City
may establish equivalent mass limits only if the user meets all the conditions
set forth in Sections 1(a) through 1(e) below.
      1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its
individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for
equivalent mass limits.
      2.   A user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than twenty (20) percent from its baseline production rates determined in
paragraph 1(c) of this Section. Upon notification of a revised production rate,
the Pretreatment Coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise
the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph 1(a) of
this Section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      3.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Pretreatment
Coordinator:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
6-6-5-2.B. The user must be in compliance with Section
6-6-16-3 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (G)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Pretreatment
Coordinator.
   (H)   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this Section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived. Note: see 40 CFR Part 403.6(c)(7).
   (I)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations. Note:
see 40 CFR Part 403.6(c)(8).
   (J)   Any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator with two (2) business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Pretreatment
Coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate. Note: see 40 CFR Part 403.6(c)(9).
All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are
required to file reports as required in this chapter, signed by an authorized
representative per Sections
6-6-9-2 and
6-6-9-3. These reports shall include all information that the City deems
necessary to make compliance determinations. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-5-4: STATE LIMITS:
   (A)   All users are subject to state standards and requirements as defined
in 35 Ill Adm. Code (IAC) 307. Specifically, the standard for discharge of
mercury is as follows:
      1.   Mercury (35 IAC 307.1102);
         (a)   Except as provided below, no person shall cause or allow the
concentration of mercury in any discharge to a publicly owned or publicly
regulated sewer system to exceed the following level, subject to the averaging
rule contained in 35 IAC 304.104(a):
 
CONSTITUENT STORET NUMBER CONCENTRATION mg/1
Mercury     71900         0.0005
 
         (b)   It shall be an exception to subsection a) if the discharge is to
a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which is required to meet a
limitation less stringent than the 0.0005 mg/l mercury concentration in which
case the discharge limitation shall be the same as that applicable to the
publicly owned or regulated sewer system to which it discharges.
         (c)   It shall be an exception to subsection a) if all the following
conditions are met:
            (1)   The discharger does not use mercury; or, the discharger uses
mercury and this use cannot be eliminated; or, the discharger uses mercury only
in chemical analysis or in laboratory or other equipment and takes reasonable
care to avoid contamination of wastewater; and,
            (2)   The discharge mercury concentration is less than 0.003 mg/l,
as determined by application of the averaging rules of 35 IAC 304.104(a); and
            (3)   The discharger is providing the best degree of treatment
consistent with technological feasibility, economic reasonableness and sound
engineering judgment. This may include no treatment for mercury; and,
            (4)   The discharger has an inspection and maintenance program
likely to reduce or to prevent an increase in the level of mercury discharges.
         (d)   The discharge of wastes from medicinal or therapeutic use of
mercury, exclusive of laboratory use, shall be exempt from the limitations of
subsection (a) if all the following conditions are met:
            (1)   The total discharge is less than 227 g (one half pound) as
mercury (Hg) in any year;
            (2)   This discharge is to a public sewer system; and
            (3)   The discharge does not, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, causes the effluent from the sewer system or POTW to exceed 0.0005 mg/
l of mercury.
         (e)   No person shall cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a
publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which, alone or in
combination with other sources, causes a violation by the POTW discharge of the
water quality standard of 35 IAC 302 for mercury applicable in the receiving
stream.
         (f)   For purposes of permit issuance the IEPA may consider
application of the exception of subsection (b) or (c) to determine compliance
with this Section. The IEPA may impose permit conditions necessary or required
to assure continued application of the exception. When subsection (b) or (c)
applies, the IEPA may impose an effluent limitation in the permit which allows
the discharge of a concentration of mercury greater than 0.0005 mg/l but not
more than 0.003 mg/l. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-5-5: LOCAL LIMITS:
The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass-through
and interference.
   (A)   Non-Toxic Pollutants:

   (C)   FSE Twenty-five Percent (25%) Requirement. The City reserves the right
to apply a Twenty-five Percent (25%) Requirement at the discharge side of the
external GI prior to mixing with any other wastewater from the contributing
FSE's property in lieu of the limits listed in Section
6-6-5-5.A above. The last section of an external GI at an FSE shall be measured
to determine that the total volume of the GI being used for any food-derived
solids to settle or accumulate plus the floatable grease-derived materials that
rise and accumulate, identified as a solids blanket and grease cap
respectively, is less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total design
hydraulic depth as measured from the effluent discharge pipe to the bottom
("Twenty-five Percent (25%) Requirement"). The City may also apply the Twenty-
five Percent (25%) Requirement for external GI that are used in non-FSE
locations such as an automobile service, repair and dispensing properties.
   (D)   The City will apply the local limits found in Sections
6-6-5-5.A and B above normally at the end-of-pipe point where the non-
residential waste is discharged to the municipal sewer system.
   (E)   The City reserves the right to establish requirements, by ordinance or
in a wastewater discharge permit or general permit, to require control over the
quantities and rates of discharge from any user.
   (F)   The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in a
wastewater discharge permit, mass limitations rather than concentration
limitations on discharges particularly if users are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (G)   The City reserves the right to set specific limits for those
pollutants not identified in Sections
6-6-5-5.A or B on a case by case basis for impacts caused to the POTW including
but not limited to interference, potential problem, pass-through and prevention
of beneficial bio-solids re-use. Those limits shall be set forth in a
wastewater discharge permit per Section
6-6-8.
      1.   Local limits for additional pollutants not identified in Sections
6-6-5-5.A or B will be noticed to the permit holder a minimum of thirty (30)
days prior to the effective date of the wastewater discharge permit. In the
event that the City receives written comment on said limit during the comment
period, the limit will take effect within sixty (60) days of the public notice
date to allow review and comment by the City.
   (H)   The City may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), by ordinance or
in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
local limits and the requirements of Section
6-6-5-2.
   (I)   Any user whose discharge may be pretreated and/or treated more
effectively by the City, and Discharges to the City's POTW that cause the City
to alter its method of wastewater treatment or bio-solids disposal to a more
costly method shall be assessed the differential cost between the more costly
method of treatment and the less costly method of treatment. Such costs shall
only be assessed upon approval of the City Council. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-5-6: RIGHT OF REVISION:
   (A)   The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits or general permits, more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter. The specific limitations on discharge listed in Section
6-6-5-5 are derived from the maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL)
calculation. The MAILs are allocated only to those IUs, at the City's
discretion, that contribute the regulated pollutant and all remaining IUs are
held to either the background concentration or slightly higher than background
but lower than the specific discharge limit. In no case shall the total of all
allocations exceed the MAIL.
   (B)   The City will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks
pollutant loading for each pollutant for new industries or increase with
existing industries. The City will recalculate the maximum concentrations from
time to time using site specific data taking into consideration revisions to
State and Federal regulations that may impact the calculations. (Ord. 868, 2-1-
2022)
6-6-5-7: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   (A)   Sampling Manhole Applicability.
      1.   All non-residential users are required to install a sampling manhole
for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with the plans
and specifications approved by the City and Section
6-6-3-6.
         a.   When required by the City, a SIU or NSRU, that does not have a
unique sampling chamber at end-of-pipe, shall install a monitoring manhole or
sampling chamber for use as the regulation location of local limits in the
building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
City.
         b.   When required by the /City, a CIU shall install a monitoring
manhole or sampling chamber for use as the regulation location of the
categorically regulated discharge in the building sewer in accordance with
plans and specifications approved by the City. This sampling chamber may be
required to be installed within the building and may be in addition to an end-
of-pipe manhole.
      2.   The City reserves the right to apply said local limits in Section
6-6-5-5.A and B at an end-of process discharge location that connects to the
POTW sewer system in the event that:
         a.   A unique sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is not available;
         b.   A more representative sample can be taken of a process batch
discharge even though an end-of-pipe manhole exists;
         c.   A more representative sample can be taken at the end-of-process
location than the end-of-pipe location as a result of impacts from dilute
wastestreams;
         d.   An end-of process location is used because the IU is unable to
provide adequate flow documentation to use a combined wastestream formula.
      3.   In the event that a suitable sampling manhole does not exist as per
Section
6-6-5-7 and no end-of-process discharge sampling location exists, the "sampling
facility" shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
   (B)   Wastewater Monitoring and/or Flow Measurement Facility Operation and
Maintenance
      1.   Such facilities will be installed and maintained at all times at the
user's expense. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that the sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge. Installation will be consistent
with the requirements of Section
6-6-3-6.
      2.   The manhole or chamber located on a building sewer discharge located
in dedicated easements shall be easily accessible to representatives of the
City twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.
      3.   The manhole or chamber at a discharge location within the building
shall be accessible to representatives of the City during normal user operating
hours.
      4.   Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if it
is substantiated to the City that the metered water supply and wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
City is made in the metered water supply to determine wastewater flow which is
documented through the use of sub-meters and/or production records. In the
event that the wastewater flow cannot be substantiated at any regulated
location, the user will be required to install flow monitoring consistent with
Section
6-6-3-6.
      5.   The sampling chamber, flow metering device, sampling equipment and
documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analysis of
samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection by the City.
(Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-5-8: MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Applicability: At minimum, all SIU including CIU as well as Non-
Significant Regulated Users (NSRU) are required to sample based on the City
monitoring frequency as stated in the wastewater discharge permit. Other users
are required to sample upon the request of the City. The users shall pay the
costs of sampling of its discharge and the costs of analyses of its samples,
whether or not the sampling and analyses are done by the user or by the POTW.
   (B)   Frequency:
      1.   All SIU including CIU with wastewater discharge permits must sample
their effluent consistent with the permit requirements and report the results
to the POTW at least twice yearly. The City may specify more frequent
reporting, quarterly or monthly, dependent of the frequency for those
parameters specified in the user's permit and the City monitoring frequency
defined in the City's Enforcement Response Plan. The SIU may have the City
conduct routine monitoring using an independent laboratory. Sampling visits of
this type will normally be unannounced.
      2.   Any NSRU with an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
shall sample their effluent and report the results to the POTW consistent with
the requirements of the wastewater discharge permit and the City Monitoring
Frequency.
      3.   The City shall have the right to perform its own sampling at any
time at any location. City data will be used for all surcharge evaluations.
      4.   The City may resample a FSE within thirty (30) calendar days when a
violation of the twenty-five percent (25%) requirement as defined in Section
6-6-5-5.D is identified.
      5.   The City may initiate sampling and analyses at a greater frequency
as a result of a violation of any discharge permit limit, including cases where
hot spot maintenance issues or blockage to the sanitary sewer system has
occurred.
      6.   The Pretreatment Coordinator will define sampling and analyses for
any batch discharges as appropriate.
      7.   Cost of City sampling and analyses for any monitoring will be
invoiced to the applicable user.
   (C)   Sample Collection:
      1.   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the entire sampling and reporting period as defined
in the wastewater discharge permit.
      2.   Except as indicated in Subsections C.3 and C.5 below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques.
      3.   In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling at
minimum collecting samples every fifteen (15) minutes during a twenty-four
(24)-hour workday; or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. A proportional number of samples shall be collected for
wastewater discharges less than twenty-four (24) hours.
      4.   Single grab samples may be required in the event of an infrequent
batch discharge or to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      5.   Samples for fats, oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
hexavalent chromium, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be
obtained using the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Multiple
grab samples that are individually preserved as specified in 40 CFR 136 and
appropriate USEPA guidance that are collected during a twenty-four (24)-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis, as follows:
         (a)   For, cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, and sulfides:
multiple grab samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
         (b)   For volatile organics and oil and grease: multiple grab samples
may only be composited in the laboratory.
      6.   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
City, as appropriate. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-5-9: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part
of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Pretreatment Coordinator or other parties approved by USEPA. (Ord. 868,
2-1-2022)
6-6-5-10: PROTECTION OF CITY SAMPLING AND FLOW METERING EQUIPMENT FROM DAMAGE:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which
is owned or contracted by the City. Any person violating this provision shall
be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. (Ord. 868,
2-1-2022)
6-6-6: GENERAL DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE:
6-6-6-1: APPLICABILITY:
Each user that discharges non-residential source waste shall provide wastewater
treatment and best management practices as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section
6-6-5 within the time limitations specified by USEPA, the State, or the
Pretreatment Coordinator, whichever is more stringent. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-6-2: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Any pretreatment facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Pretreatment
Coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the Pretreatment Coordinator
before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
City under the provisions of this chapter.
All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements. Users shall
obtain all necessary construction-operating permits from the IEPA prior to the
City connection and/or discharge permit(s) being issued. IEPA will make the
determination of actual permitting requirements based on changes in the
wastewater volume or characteristics generated at the user site. The City will
track and parallel this IEPA permitting process. No sources of non-residential
wastewater will be allowed to discharge to City POTW until all permitting
requirements have been satisfied. Such pretreatment facilities shall be under
the control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater operator.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported to the City and IEPA prior to the user's initiation of the
changes. Users shall obtain all additional construction-operating permits from
IEPA and the City for the changes prior to discharge. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-6-3: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
At minimum, the City may require the additional pretreatment measures defined
below. The City reserves the right to make unannounced inspections of any
additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours whether the user
has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit or not.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Pretreatment Coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require any person or user
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. The City may issue an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (D)   Grease Interceptor (GI) maintenance. A GI located inside an FSE will
be inspected and cleaned weekly. A GI located outside an FSE on its property
shall be inspected and the grease cap and solids blanket minimally cleaned
every three months; the entire contents of the trap cleaned annually; and the
GI repaired regularly, as needed, by the Owner at his expense. Logs of
inspection and cleaning are to be posted in a readily accessible location of
the facility. It shall be the responsibility of the FSE to inspect its GI
during the pumping procedure to ensure the trap is properly cleaned out and
that all fittings and fixtures inside the trap are in working condition and
functioning properly. In the event that actual operations of the GI fail to
produce results that consistently prevent prohibitive discharges, as defined in
Section
6-6-5-2, or fail to meet local limits, as defined in Section
6-6-5-5, the owner of the FSE will be required by the Superintendent to have
the GI cleaned at a more frequent rate or install or modify pretreatment as
necessary. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-6-4: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP) PLAN:
   (A)   FSE's may be required to develop, implement and maintain Best
Management Practices (BMP) plans that include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Proper storage of unused cooking oil;
      2.   Segregation, collection, and proper storage of waste cooking oil;
      3.   Disposal of food waste into the trash or garbage disposal;
      4.   Installation of drain screens for sinks and floors, to be emptied
into trash receptacles;
      5.   Sweep all floor debris for solid waste disposal prior to wash down;
      6.   Clean all mats and dispose of mop water through a utility sink that
is connected to the FOG control mechanism;
      7.   Wipe-up grease spills before using water;
      8.   Employee training within ninety (90) days of initiation and twice
each calendar year thereafter;
      9.   Grease interceptor maintenance;
      10.   Kitchen vent, hood and exhaust filter maintenance;
      11.   Record keeping requirements;
      12.   Notifications required for spills or slug loads changes; and
      13.   Notices and signage advising employees in the language used in the
kitchen.
All FSE's that meet the criteria defined in Section
6-6-6-1 are required to develop and implement a BMP plan regardless whether
such FSE are regulated by a wastewater discharge permit or not.
   (B)   Each FSE meeting the criteria in Section
6-6-6-1 is to provide ready documentation as follows that the provisions of the
BMP plan are being implemented:
      1.   Specifics of documentation:
         (a)   Site diagram showing location of all containers holding unused
or spent yellow grease;
         (b)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental
discharge to storm or sanitary sewers. Such procedures include, but are not
limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training and building of containment structures or equipment;
         (c)   Location of notice/signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event
of a spill, accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug discharge or a
bypass of any part of a pretreatment system; and
         (d)   Off-site emergency (24-hour) telephone number, and backup
telephone number.
      2.   Notification Procedure. The BMP plan shall contain procedures for
immediately notifying the Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental or slug
discharge of any raw materials or recycled oil to either the sanitary or storm
sewer consistent with the requirements in Section
6-6-9-7.
   (C)   The City may require the submittal of BMP plans and documentation of
procedures required in this Section. Review of such plans and documentation of
procedures by the City shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to
modify the user's facility or BMP plan and procedures as necessary to meet all
requirements of this chapter. Review by the City does not constitute an
approval of a BMP plan and procedures, and the City and its designee(s) are not
to be construed as responsible for the actions of the user and any impacts the
user may cause as a result of a spill or slug discharge. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-6-5: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE AND SLUG CONTROL PLAN:
   (A)   All permitted non-residential users are required to develop, implement
and maintain BMPs in the form of an Accidental Discharge & Slug Control Plan
hereafter referred to as spill plan. All non-residential users that meet the
below criteria are required and implement a spill plan regardless whether the
user is regulated by a discharge permit or not.
      1.   Chemicals (raw materials, chemical intermediates, wastes to be
recycled, final products, or utility chemicals) that total or exceed 250
gallons at or on its site;
      2.   Prohibited discharge materials as defined in Section
6-6-5-2 at or on its site; or
      3.   Hazardous waste as defined in Section
6-6-9-9 at or on its site; or
      4.   Been defined by the Pretreatment Coordinator to have a need to
control slug discharges.
   (B)   The spill plan which is required to be submitted to the City for
review if the user's discharge is regulated shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   Specifics of Spill Plan:
         (a)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
         (b)   Description of stored chemicals, including quantity of chemicals
and type and number of storage containers;
         (c)   Site diagram showing location of all tanks holding greater than
or equal to two hundred and fifty (250) gallons or areas containing eight (8)
drums or more of raw materials, prohibited wastes, wastes to be recycled,
hazardous wastes or final product. Identification and location of all liquid
materials is mandatory;
         (d)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response. Building containment structures or production equipment changes are
considered procedures to prevent adverse spills. If containment structures are
connected to the sanitary sewer, a valve normally left in a closed position is
required;
         (e)   Location of notice/signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event
of a spill, accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug discharge or a
bypass of any part of a pretreatment system; and
         (f)   Emergency telephone number (24-hour) off-site and backup
telephone number. If the spill plan has been submitted, any change in the
telephone numbers should be submitted within five working days when revised.
      2.   Notification Procedure. The spill plan shall contain procedures for
immediately notifying the Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental or slug
discharge, as required by Section
6-6-9-7;
      3.   Documentation. The spill plan shall contain a sample of the
documentation maintained at the site that:
         (a)   Ensures that all employees who are in a position to cause,
discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedures; and
         (b)   Such logs to verify inspection and maintenance procedures to
prevent adverse impacts and confirm that said procedures are being performed on
a regular basis. At minimum, logs are required to verify valves in containment
structures, if present, are closed.
   (C)   Review of such plans and operating procedures by the City shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility or spill
plan as necessary to meet all requirements of this chapter. Review by the City
does not constitute an approval of a spill plan and the City and its designee
(s) are not to be construed as responsible for the actions of the user and any
impacts the user may cause as a result of a spill or slug load.
   (D)   At least once every two (2) years the Pretreatment Coordinator shall
evaluate whether each SIU needs a revision to its spill plan. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may require any user to submit at a frequency less than two (2)
years such spill plan or require modification of an existing spill plan based
on changes that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident that
had the potential to impact the POTW.
In alternate years, the Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether each
NSRU is required to file a revision to its spill plan based on changes that
have occurred at the site or in response to an incident that had the potential
to impact the POTW. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)

    E.   Categorical Monitoring Waivers
      1.   Authority. Pursuant to 40 CFR Part 403.12(e)(2)(v) and (vi), the
City may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user.
This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are derived
from mass standards or production based standards. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than 5 years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before
the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit.
         (c)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
      2.   Application Requirements
         (a)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         (b)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with Section
6-6-7-6, and include the certification statement in Section
6-6-7-6.
         (c)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from
40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was
used in the analysis.
      3.   Documentation and Record Retention for CIU Monitoring Waivers: Any
grant of the monitoring waiver by the Pretreatment Coordinator must be included
as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Pretreatment Coordinator for 3 years after expiration of the
waiver.
Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-7-6: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL APPLICATION SIGNATORIES AND CERTIFICATION:
   (A)   All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports and
certification statements must be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations".
   (B)   If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of this Section must be submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator
prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-7-7: INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DECISIONS:
The Pretreatment Coordinator will evaluate the data furnished by the user and
may require additional information. Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt
of a complete wastewater discharge permit application, the Pretreatment
Coordinator will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge
permit. The Pretreatment Coordinator may deny any application for a Wastewater
Discharge Permit. If the Pretreatment Coordinator fails to act within ninety

City. If the premises sold or otherwise transferred by the permittee to a new
owner who will maintain the operation in the same premises, whether or not the
seller will continue to operate the equipment or the equipment is leased to
another entity for its operation at the site of the original permittee, then
the permit held by the seller and/or owner shall be reissued by the City to the
new owner and/or operator as a temporary permit; provided:
   (A)   The new owner and/or operator notified the City thirty (30) calendar
days in advance of the transaction, and
   (B)   The new owner and/or operator confirmed to the City, within 5 working
days of the transaction, of completion of the date of sale or execution of an
operating contract, and
   (C)   The new owner and/or operator shall apply for a new permit within
ninety (90) calendar days.
Failure to provide the sale/transfer notification defined in subsection A and B
above, renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of said sale and/or
transfer date. It is further provided that the temporary permit shall only be
effective for one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the date of sale or
transfer. The City shall have the same remedies for violation of temporary
permits as it has for violation of other wastewater discharge permits. (Ord.
868, 2-1-2022)

wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-9-1: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USERS:
Should the City find that a non-residential user does not meet pretreatment
standards and requirements applicable to its discharge, causes or contributes
to a potential problem at the POTW, or when analysis of waste or observation of
the effect of such wastes on the POTW indicate that said wastes cannot be
treated satisfactorily at such POTW, or that said wastes are injurious to the
POTW, or to the treatment processes, or pollute the natural waters within the
City, its service areas or the Waters of the State of Illinois additional
pretreatment and/or O&M will be required by the City to meet pretreatment
standards and requirements. Such facilities as the City may deem necessary for
Pretreatment of the wastes shall be furnished by and at the expense of the user
as a condition of the discharge of said wastes into the POTW or to any natural
water within the City service area.
   (A)   Pretreatment Review: The Pretreatment Coordinator will require the
user to initiate a pretreatment review through a telephone call, letter or
certified letter to the authorized representative of the user.
   (B)   Pretreatment Initiation Meeting. A Pretreatment Initiation Meeting
will be held between the Pretreatment Coordinator and the user to discuss the
problem and the solution to said problem. If it determined that changes in
operation and maintenance, plant modifications, and/or the installation of
pretreatment equipment shall occur to resolve non-compliance, a schedule shall
be established with events and completion deadlines agreeable to both parties
to resolve the non-compliance. If appropriate, a compliance agreement defining
the agreed upon schedule will be sent from the City to the user shortly after

engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation). The user shall identify whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.
   (D)   Final Report. A final report will be filed with the Pretreatment
Coordinator by the user normally required within 90 calendar days from the end
of the schedule deadline to verify the success or failure or the schedule
objective chosen by the user. The final report will if appropriate identify the
steps being taken by the user to resolve non-compliance. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-9-2: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL USERS:
In the event that either the City, EPA or a user determines that the user is

hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must
be submitted under Section
6-6-9-6. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections
6-6-9-2.A,
6-6-9-2.C, and
6-6-9-3.B.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A, above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator, the USEPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) calendar days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)

make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the above named entities will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   (B)   The City shall have the right to set up on the user's property or
require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
   (C)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated twice yearly (at six month
intervals) to ensure their accuracy. The user shall submit these calibration
reports semi-annually to the City with the periodic compliance reports required
in Section
6-6-9-3.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Pretreatment Coordinator and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   (E)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Pretreatment Coordinator and his
designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-10-2: RECORD KEEPING:
   (A)   Users. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with BMPs established under Section
6-6-8-2. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (B)   City. The City will maintain documentation of any monitoring waiver
issued per Section
6-6-7-5.D for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the waiver.
The documentation will include the reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver. (Ord. 868, 2-
1-2022)
6-6-10-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the Pretreatment Coordinator has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the Pretreatment Coordinator may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of Kankakee County. (Ord.
868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-11: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual or general wastewater discharge
permits, and monitoring programs, and the Pretreatment Coordinator inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator and City Attorney, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-12: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE:
The Pretreatment Coordinator may publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction
served by the POTW, a list of the users at any time which, during the previous
twelve (12) months, were in significant non-compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant non-compliance
shall be applicable to all SIUs and CIUs (or any other user that violates
paragraphs (C), (D) or (H) of this section and shall mean: 
   (A)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66 percent) or more of all the measurements
taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-(6-) month period exceed
(by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement as defined in
Section
6-6-5;
   (B)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33 percent) or more of wastewater measurements
taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-(6-) month period equals or
exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
including instantaneous limits, as defined by Section
6-6-5 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by Section
6-6-5 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Pretreatment Coordinator has determined caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Pretreatment
Coordinator exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within forty-five (45) calendar days after the due
date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report non-compliance; or
   (H)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of BMPs, that
the Pretreatment Coordinator determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-13: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
6-6-13-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
   (A)   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement including instantaneous limits, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation (NOV). Within ten (10)
working days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and
a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Pretreatment
Coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may initiate a pretreatment review
meeting for any violation issued under Section
6-6-13-1.A but most likely for the first violation of any parameter. The City
shall schedule a pretreatment review meeting, normally within thirty calendar
days of the determination that a meeting is required.
As a result of a pretreatment review meeting, the City may issue a compliance
directive stating that the user is in a "corrective action" status. A plan for
correction and compliance schedule illustrating milestones may be issued by the
City to the user. This plan for correction and compliance schedule may become
part of the user's permit. The user is responsible for meeting the permit
limits at all times. The plan for correction, compliance schedule and revised
permit does not relieve the user of meeting the permit limits and/or ordinance
requirements. The user shall take whatever actions are necessary to meet the
permit limits and permit conditions.
   (C)   As a result of a violation, the City may continue to sample the user
and inspect the user's progress towards meeting milestones as needed to
determine if the user is complying with the conditions of the plan of action,
compliance schedule and/or permit. In the event the City detects and documents
any violation; a NOV will be issued to the user.
   (D)   Each detected violation of the plan of action, compliance schedule,
and permit, will result in a NOV being issued to the user. When NOV #3 (total
of three NOVs) is issued, a "ticket" may be issued to the user, authorized
representative. The ticket is a legal notice requiring the user to appear in
court, City Adjudication Court. The City may charge assessments to the user as
provided for in the ordinance.
   (E)   When the user has met the conditions of the plan of action, compliance
schedule, and permit, the City will notify the user in writing that the
conditions have been satisfied and they are no longer under a "corrective
action" status if such a status was formally issued.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Pretreatment
Coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a NOV. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-13-2: COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS:
The Pretreatment Coordinator may enter into compliance agreements (i.e. consent
orders) assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for non-compliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
6-6-13-4 and
6-6-13-5 and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-13-3: SHOW CAUSE ORDER:
The Pretreatment Coordinator may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear at a specified date and time to show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten (10) working days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-13-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the non-compliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-13-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-
2022)
6-6-13-6: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The Pretreatment Coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Section
6-6-13-7 are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Pretreatment Coordinator prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections
6-6-13-3 or
6-6-13-7.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-13-7: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in Section
6-6-8-6, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
   (A)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   (B)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (C)   Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   (D)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   (E)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
6-6-5.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
6-6-13-3 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the Pretreatment Coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-14: PENALTIES AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
6-6-14-1: RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED:
Any entity or user violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or who
causes damage to or impairs the City's POTW shall be liable to the City for any
expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The City may
invoice the costs, including but not limited to, sampling and analyses
associated with the investigation, costs of mitigating impact to the POTW,
costs of preparing the administrative enforcement actions such as notices and
orders investigative and/or correction actions, and review of response(s) from
the user. In the event of damage, losses or impairments, the City shall bill
the user for the costs incurred by the City for any cleaning, repair,
replacement or other investigative and/or corrective action(s) as a response to
the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute
a violation of this chapter enforceable under the provisions of Section
6-6-13.
Recovery of costs incurred also includes but is not limited to the following
provisions specific for Food Service Establishments (FSE):
   (A)   Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee. FSE that operate without a grease
interceptor (GI) may be required to pay an annual Grease Disposal Mitigation
Fee to equitably cover the costs of increase maintenance of the sewer system as
a result of the FSE's inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater
discharge. This section shall not be interpreted to allow the new construction
of, or existing FSE undergoing remodeling to operate without an approved GI.
      1.   The Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee shall be established in Section
7-6-4 and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining
the sewer system for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or
solidifying agents attributable to the FSE resulting from the lack of a grease
interceptor or grease control device.
      2.   Sewer System Overflows, Public Nuisance, Abatement and Cleanup
Costs. Notwithstanding the waiver of grease interceptor installation for
existing FSE established in Section
6-6-3-8, FSE found to have contributed to a sewer blockage, Sewer System
Overflows (SSOs) or any sewer system interferences resulting from the discharge
of wastewater or waste containing FOG may be subject to costs incurred by the
City's established in Section
7-6-4. SSOs may cause threat and injury to public health, safety, and welfare
of life and property and are hereby declared public nuisances. Furthermore,
sewer lateral failures and SSOs caused by FSE alone or collectively, are the
responsibility of the private property owner or FSE, and individual(s) as a
responsible officer or owner of the FSE. If the City must act immediately to
contain and clean up an SSO caused by blockage of a private or public sewer
lateral or system serving a FSE, or at the request of the property owner or
operator of the FSE, or because of the failure of the property owner or FSE to
abate the condition causing immediate threat of injury to the health, safety,
welfare, or property of the public, the City's costs for such abatement may be
entirely borne by the property owner or operator of the FSE, and the individual
(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s) and may constitute a debt
to the City and become due and payable upon the City's request for
reimbursement of such costs. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-14-2: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   (A)   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may fine
such user in an amount not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).
Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation. Each day that an Ordinance
violation continues, shall be treated as a distinct and separate offense.
   (B)   Users desiring reconsideration of such fines must file a written
request for the Pretreatment Coordinator to reconsider the fine along with full
payment of the fine amount within 30 calendar days of being notified of the
fine. Where a request has merit, the Pretreatment Coordinator may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the
user.
   (C)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-
2022)
6-6-14-3: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may petition the Circuit Court of
Kankakee County through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual or general wastewater discharge permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord.
868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-14-4: CIVIL PENALTIES:
When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may petition the Circuit Court of
Kankakee County through the City Attorney for civil penalties as follows:
   (A)   Any user shall be subject to the imposition of a civil penalty in at
least the amount of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) a day for each
violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. Each
day that an Ordinance violation continues, shall be treated as a distinct and
separate offense.
   (B)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may recover costs, including but not
limited to, filing fees, witness fees, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-14-5: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the Pretreatment Coordinator is empowered to take more than
one enforcement action against any non-compliant user. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)

6-6-16: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
6-6-16-1: UPSET:
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, "Upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include non-compliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of paragraph C, below, are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the Pretreatment
Coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written report must be provided within
five (5) working days)
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
         (b)   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-16-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for non-compliance with the general prohibitions in Sections
6-6-5-2.A and B or the specific prohibitions in Sections
6-6-5-2 C1-26 (excluding paragraphs C2, C10 and C17) if it can prove that it
did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or
interference or that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable bio-solids use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)
6-6-16-3: BYPASS:
   (A)   For the purposes of this section,
 
BYPASS:                 The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
                        portion of a user's treatment or pretreatment facility.
                        Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
                        treatment facilities which causes them to become
                        inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
                        occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
                        damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in
                        production.
 
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   (C)   Bypass Notifications
      1.   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Pretreatment Coordinator, at least ten (10)
working days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      2.   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the Pretreatment
Coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) working
days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
   (D)   POTW Actions
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Pretreatment Coordinator may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph C of this
section.
      2.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Pretreatment Coordinator
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph D.1 of
this section. (Ord. 868, 2-1-2022)

each year from heart disease and lung cancer according to the National Cancer
Institute. Secondhand tobacco smoke causes heart disease, stroke, cancer,
sudden infant death syndrome, low birth weight in infants, asthma and
exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia in children and adults.
Secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in the
United States. Illinois workers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke are at
increased risk of premature death. An estimated two thousand nine hundred
(2,900) Illinois citizens die each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco
smoke.
The city council of the city of Momence also finds that the United States
surgeon general's 2006 report has determined that there is no risk free level
of exposure to secondhand smoke; the scientific evidence that secondhand smoke
causes serious diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory
illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma, is massive and conclusive; separating
smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot
eliminate secondhand smoke exposure; smoke free workplace policies are
effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure; and smoke free workplace
policies do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry.
The city council of the city of Momence also finds that the Illinois
environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be
reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air
cleaners, which are capable only of filtering the particulate matter and odors
in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. The American
Society Of Heating, Refrigerating And Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases
its ventilation standards on totally smoke free environments because it cannot
determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer
causing chemicals, and ASHRAE acknowledges that technology does not exist that
can remove chemicals that cause cancer from the air. A June 30, 2005, ASHRAE
position document on secondhand smoke concludes that, at present, the only
means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to
eliminate all smoking activity indoors. (Ord. 709, 4-4-2011)

   NONDIVISIBLE LOAD OR VEHICLES: Permit loads are deemed to be reasonably
dismantled (nondivisible) if, when separated into smaller loads or vehicles,

   (B)   Overweight And/Or Overdimension Vehicles:
      1.   It shall be unlawful for any person to be in control of, to drive,
to park, or move on, upon or across or for the owner to cause or knowingly
permit to be parked, driven, or moved upon or across, any street or highway
under the jurisdiction of the city, any vehicle or combination of vehicles

      1.   A permit shall be required for the movement of any vehicle or
combination of vehicles with a nondivisible load on roadways and bridges within
the jurisdiction of the city of Momence which exceeds the dimensions and
weights permitted for the particular roadways to be traversed.
For a shipping container to be considered a nondivisible load and eligible to
be hauled under an oversize/overweight permit issued by the city of Momence, it
must be in a sealed shipping container for international shipment and in route
for import or export to/from a foreign country. Upon request from law
enforcement or city of Momence officials, the driver must present
documentation, such as a bill of lading or manifest that specifically ties the
sealed container being moved to the container listed in the documentation
through the unique container number (consists of 4 letters and 7 numbers). The
documentation must also clearly state the foreign country destination or origin
of that container. Failure to produce such documentation shall result in the
load being considered a divisible load and ineligible to be permitted.
Furthermore, intermodal oversea container permits must comply with the same
axle spacing requirement as the Illinois department of transportation.
         (a)   Axle Spacing Requirements: The spacing requirements for all
overweight loaded routine and LCO permits, as well as all towed routine
permits, are as follows:
            (1) The spacing between the steer axle and the first axle on the
tractor tandem may not be less than eight feet one inch (8'1");

axle of the trailer may not be less than eighteen feet six inches (18'6"); and
            (3) The sum of all axle spacings must be at least forty three feet
six inches (43'6").
As a result, failure to comply with these requirements for the load may be
considered to be operating without a permit and subject to be fined back to
legal weight.
      2.   The city with respect to any street or highway under its
jurisdiction may upon application to the Momence police department on forms

7-6-2-3: DETERMINATION OF RATES AND CHARGES:
For the use of and the service rendered by the sewage works, rates and charges
shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real estate
or building that is connected with the city's sewer system or otherwise
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly, into the sewer of the city, which rates and charges
shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount determinable
as follows:
   (A)   Except as herein otherwise provided, sewage rates and charges per
month for the sewage works shall consist of a uniform fixed rate which shall be
charged to all users, and a variable rate applicable to all users which shall
be based on the quantity of water used on or in the property or premises
subject to such rates and charges, as the same is measured by the water meter
there in use.
   (B)   The fixed rate charged to all domestic users shall be twenty-five
dollars and eighty-eight cents ($25.88) per month and the variable rate
additional charge for all domestic users shall be two dollars and forty-one
cents ($2.41) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water usage, or part thereof,
per month. These rates shall constitute the domestic user charge rate.
   (C)   Those classified as industrial users, the total fixed industrial
charge of forty-four thousand dollars ($44,000.00) per month, will be allocated
amongst all the industrial users based on each individual industrial users'
monthly use per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water as calculated by the
Superintendent of the Sewer Department compared to the utilization of that same
standard quantity of water per month by all industrial users. The variable rate
additional charge for all industrial users shall be two dollars and forty-one
cents ($2.41) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water usage, or part thereof,
per month. These rates shall constitute the industrial user charge rate.
   (D)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's
sewer system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by
the city's waterworks and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by
a meter, or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount
of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city, in order
to ascertain the rates of charge, or the owner or other interested party, at
his expense, may install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
city for the determination of the sewage discharge.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city's sewer
system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the
city's waterworks, and in addition uses water from another source which is not
measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to
the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the city in order to ascertain the rates of charge, or the owner
or other interested party at his expense may install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city's sewer
system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of ten thousand
(10,000) gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city
that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and
cannot enter the sanitary sewer system, then the owner or other interested
party shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (G)   In the event two (2) or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
city's sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges shall apply to
each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (H)   The sewer rates shall apply to any user of the sewer system without
regard to what point in the sewage treatment process sanitary sewage, treated
or untreated industrial wastes, water or other liquids are inserted into any
point in the city's sewer treatment or delivery process.
   (I)   In the event two (2) or more dwelling units such as trailers,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the city's sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are users
of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out in
section
7-6-1-2 of this chapter, except that the fixed charge shall be equal to the
number of dwelling units multiplied by the fixed rate specified in subsection
(B) of this section. In the case of trailer parks the number of dwelling units
shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of trailers located and
installed in said park plus any other dwelling units served through the meter.
A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or
spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.
   (J)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the city may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the
minimum charge and in the user charge as may be equitable.
   (K)   For the service rendered to the city, the city shall be subject to the
same rates and charges hereinabove provided or to rates and charges established
in harmony therewith.
   (L)   There shall be an annual rate review and likely increase to be
effective May 1 of each calendar year. In the event the annual rate review is
not completed by May 1st of each calendar year, the rate will nonetheless
increase by three percent (3%) and shall remain in that amount for the next
twelve months unless another fee is established and this section amended.
(Ord., 3-2-1970; amd. Ord. 179, 3-1-1976; Ord. 517, 6-3-2002; Ord. 601-A, 3-20-
2006; Ord. 873, 3-21-2022)
7-6-2-4: BASIS OF CHARGES; DETERMINATION OF RATE SURCHARGE:
In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to the
services rendered, the city shall base its charges not only on volume but also
on the strength and character of the sewage and waste which it is required to
dispose of. The city shall require the owner or other user to measure and
determine the strength and content of all sewage and waste discharged, either
directly or indirectly into the city's sewer system in such manner and by such
method as may be deemed practical in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case in order to determine the proper charge. The owner or
other user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all
times.
Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes shall be
made on the following basis: (Ord. 516, 6-3-2002)
   (A)   Rate Surcharge Based Upon Suspended Solids: There shall be an
additional charge of twenty four cents ($0.24) per one thousand (1,000) gallons
of flow for each one hundred milligrams (100 mg), or fraction thereof, of
suspended solids in excess of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l)
of fluid.
   (B)   Rate Surcharge Based Upon BOD: There shall be an additional charge of
twenty four cents ($0.24) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of flow for each one
hundred milligrams (100 mg), or fraction thereof, of biochemical oxygen demand
in excess of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) of fluid. The city
council is authorized to prohibit the dumping of wastes into the city's sewer
system which, in its discretion, is deemed harmful. (Ord. 707, 2-22-2011)
   (C)   FOG Surcharge: The FOG surcharge for fats, oils, and greases (FOG)
loadings from industrial users which are in excess of one hundred milligrams
per liter (100 mg/l) are hereby established. When this concentration is
exceeded, the surcharge will be sixty cents ($0.60) per pound.
   (D)   Slug Or Slug Load: When a "slug or slug load" as defined herein is
detected at any location in the sanitary sewers, and the source of same can be
confirmed, a charge shall be made and invoiced by the superintendent, as
follows:
      1.   Two hundred dollars ($200.00) per day for the discharge of any
wastewater having a pH equal to or greater than 4.5 and less than 5.0.
      2.   Five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for the discharge of any
wastewater having a pH less than 4.5.
      3.   A user whose discharge flow exceeds fifty thousand (50,000) gallons
per day of the violations or as an average during the month of the violations
shall be charged twice the amounts described in subsections (D)1 and (D)2 of
this section.
      4.   Plus any extra expenses, losses, and/or damages occasioned by the
city of Momence by reason of such "slug or slug load" entering the sanitary
sewers or POTW. (Ord. 516, 6-3-2002)
7-6-2-5: STUDY OF REVENUE SYSTEM:
In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and
equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various
users, the city shall cause a study to be made within a reasonable period of
time following the first full calendar year of operation subsequent to the
completion of the improvement project. Such study shall include, but not be
limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive
strength effluents from industrial users, determination of users subject to the
industrial cost recovery charges 1 , volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the financial
position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to provide
reasonable funds for operation and maintenance, replacements and capital
improvements to the waste treatment system. Therefore, on an annual basis,
within a reasonable period of time following the normal accounting period, the
city shall cause a similar study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the
fairness and equity of the rates and charges for sewage services on a
continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by officers and/or employees
of the city or by a firm of certified public accountants and/or a firm of
consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such studies. (Ord.
179, 3-1-1976)
 
Notes

  7-6-3 of this chapter.
7-6-2-6: USE OF REVENUES RESTRICTED:
Separate accounting procedures shall be established for the collection, holding
and disbursement of revenues generated under this chapter. Revenues thus
generated are to be used solely for the operation, maintenance and replacement
of the treatment works. (Ord. 179, 3-1-1976)
7-6-2-7: BILLING SYSTEM; LIABILITY OF OWNER:
The rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the city monthly as the
city may deem appropriate and as determined by the bylaws and regulations of
the city as herein provided for and shall be collected in the manner provided
by law and ordinance 1 . Said rates and charges will be billed to the tenant or
tenants occupying the property served unless otherwise requested in writing by
the owners, but such billing shall in nowise relieve the owner from liability
in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of the
properties served, which are occupied by tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining
whether such rates and charges have been paid by such tenants; provided, that
such examination shall be made in the office in which said records are kept and
during the hours that such office is open for business. (Ord. 179, 3-1-1976)

necessary for the safe, economic and efficient management of the city sewer and
connections to the sewer system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating
and refunding of rates and charges. (Ord. 179, 3-1-1976)
7-6-2-9: EFFECTIVE DATE OF RATES:
Except as otherwise provided, the rates and charges as herein set forth shall
become effective on the date that sanitary sewers of the sewer system are made
available for connection to any lot, parcel of real estate or building; but in
any event, said rates and charges shall become effective no later than May 1,
1976. (Ord. 179, 3-1-1976)
7-6-2-10: ANNUAL COST REVIEW:
The superintendent, not less than annually, shall prepare an estimate of
Momence sewer utility cost components for operation, maintenance, and
replacement. These estimated cost components shall be reviewed no less than
annually, and approved by the city council. (Ord. 707, 2-22-2011)
7-6-3: INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY SYSTEM:
7-6-3-1: DEFINITIONS:
Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meanings of the terms
used in this section shall be as follows:
ACT: The federal water pollution control act and amendments of 1972, public law
92-500, adopted by the 92nd congress on October 18, 1972.
INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY: The recovery by the city from the industrial users of
the treatment works of the grant amount allocable to the treatment of wastes
from such users pursuant to section 204(b) of the act.
INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY PERIOD: That period during which the grant amount
allocated to the treatment of wastes from industrial users is recovered from
the industrial users of such works, which shall be a period of thirty (30)
years.
INDUSTRIAL USER: Any nongovernmental user of publicly owned treatment works
identified in the "Standard Industrial Classification Manual", 1972, office of
management and budget, United States government, as amended and supplemented,
under the following divisions: A, B, D, E and I.
A user in the divisions listed above may be excluded from this class if it is
determined that it will introduce primarily domestic wastes or wastes from
sanitary conveniences.
INDUSTRIAL WASTES: The wastewater discharges resulting from industrial, trade
or business processes as distinct from their employees' domestic waste or waste
from sanitary conveniences.
NONINDUSTRIAL USER: Any governmental or residential user of a publicly owned
treatment works which introduces primarily segregated domestic waste or wastes
from sanitary conveniences. The term also includes commercial, institutional
and other industrial users where it has been determined that the waste
contributed by these users is primarily segregated domestic wastes or waste
from sanitary conveniences.
PROJECT: Project no. C170865 which is defined as a separate and distinct
project for construction of the Momence municipal sewage works which was
sponsored by the U.S. environmental protection agency under the provisions of
public law 92-500. This project does not include past or future construction,
equipment or other services not included under the specific project number and
in the approved plans, specifications and change orders for the project.
RECOVERED AMOUNTS: The annual payments from industrial users for their shares
of the federal grant allocable to the cost of treating industrial wastes, which
is determined by dividing the total federal grant amount allocable to treatment
of industrial waste by the industrial cost recovery period.
RETAINED AMOUNTS: Fifty percent (50%) of the amounts recovered from industrial
users, together with interest earned thereon. (Ord. 181, 3-1-1976)
7-6-3-2: DETERMINATION OF USES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY CHARGES:
The city shall determine which users are subject to paying the industrial cost
recovery charges, in the following manner:
   (A)   The city shall require appropriate employees of the sewage works to
review billing records and prepare a list of all potential industrial users, as
identified in each of the divisions listed in section
7-6-3-1 of this chapter.
   (B)   The list of all potential industrial users shall be analyzed on the
basis of data available at the sewage works billing office (i.e., type of
business, volume charges, excessive loading charges, estimated number of
employees, etc.) for the purpose of developing preliminary lists of probable
"industrial" and probable "nonindustrial" users.
   (C)   The city shall conduct an immediate survey of all probable
"industrial" users in order to substantiate the validity of classifying a
particular user as an "industrial" user. Each user initially classified as an
industrial user shall be notified as to his classification.
   (D)   After completing the survey of all probable "industrial" users, the
city shall review the list of probable "nonindustrial" users to determine if
the initial classification of any of these users should be reconsidered. Where
appropriate, individual users will be contacted in order to determine the
proper classification.
   (E)   After an industrial user has been notified of his classification, the
user may request reconsideration by furnishing data and measurements acceptable
to the city for the determination of sewage discharge. The city shall have the
right to measure and determine the strength and content of all sewage and waste
discharges, either directly or indirectly into the city's sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practicable in the
light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case in order to
determine the proper user classification.
   (F)   Within a reasonable period of time following completion of the sewage
works construction project, the city shall have completed the initial
classification of all industrial users. During the first calendar year of
operation, subsequent to completion of the construction project, and annually
thereafter, the city will review, classify and reclassify all users as either
industrial or nonindustrial users based upon measurements and data obtained by
the city or furnished by individual users. Normally, each user will retain his
classification until the next succeeding classification period. However, if
there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or delivery flow rate
characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an individual user, then
the classification of the user may be reviewed and established during the year
in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of each case. (Ord.
181, 3-1-1976)
7-6-3-3: DETERMINATION OF INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY CHARGES:
   (A)   In the event that a user of the treatment works is classified as an
industrial user and is not excluded from this classification based on its
sewage characteristics, a separate charge shall be levied on the user in
addition to that established in section
7-6-2 of this chapter. (Ord. 181, 3-1-1976)
   (B)   The industrial cost recovery charges for the treatment of industrial
wastes at the treatment plant shall be based upon the volume of sewage flow
billed to industrial users, as determined in accordance with appropriate
provisions for determining billed flow included in section
7-6-2 of this chapter and the total strength and character of industrial wastes
which is introduced into the waste treatment system. The strength and character
of industrial wastes shall be measured at the industrial user's expense as
provided for in section
7-6-2 of this chapter and furnished to the city. The owner or industrial user
shall furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times. In
the event that measurement of the strength and character of industrial wastes
are not provided to the city on a timely basis, the measurements of the
strength and character of industrial wastes shall be determined by the city on
the basis of a sample, authorized hereunder, to be taken by the city for the
purpose of appropriate billing. The industrial cost recovery rates for the
treatment of wastes shall be as follows:
 
Monthly flow                $0.12 per 1,000 gallons
Monthly total pounds of BOD 0.08 per pound
Monthly total pounds of SS  0.08 per pound
 
(Ord. 515, 6-3-2002)
   (C)   However, in the event an "industrial user" can and does show to the
satisfaction of the city that a portion of the total monthly billed sewage flow
is from sanitary conveniences, then the flows and pollutant loadings to which
the industrial cost recovery charge is applied, shall be determined on the
basis of net flow and pollutant loadings excluding sanitary conveniences.
   (D)   If there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or delivery
flow rate characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an industrial
user, such user's share shall be adjusted accordingly.
   (E)   If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works, each
existing industrial user's share shall be adjusted accordingly.
   (F)   An industrial user's share shall include only that portion of the
grant assistance allocable to its use or to capacity firmly committed for its
use.
   (G)   An industrial user's share shall not include an interest component.
(Ord. 181, 3-1-1976)
7-6-3-4: MONTHLY BILLING SYSTEM:
The industrial cost recovery charges for the treatment services on or after the
effective date hereof shall be prepared and billed monthly. (Ord. 181, 3-1-
1976)
7-6-3-5: REVENUE SYSTEM:
The city shall account for all industrial cost recovery payments in the
following manner:
   (A)   All revenues derived from the industrial cost recovery rates and
charges shall be segregated and kept in a special fund, separate and apart from
all other funds of the city. The special fund shall be designated the "water
pollution control center industrial cost recovery fund" and payment of said
amount into said fund shall be deemed a reasonable expense of operation of the
sewage works for the purpose of computing net operating revenue.
   (B)   Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of the first
calendar year after completion of construction and improvements to the
treatment works, and annually thereafter, the city shall return fifty percent
(50%) of the amounts recovered through the industrial cost recovery charges,
together with any interest earned thereon, to the U.S. treasury. The remaining
fifty percent (50%) retained by the city shall be invested in authorized
obligations of the U.S. government or any agency thereof pending use of the
retained amount for reconstruction or expansion.
   (C)   Eighty percent (80%) of the funds retained by the city in the water
pollution control center industrial cost recovery fund or authorized
investments and the interest earned thereon, shall be expended only for the
purpose of eligible costs of the expansion and reconstruction of the treatment
works associated with the project and necessary to meet requirements of the
act. All such expansion or reconstruction programs must be approved in writing
by the regional administrator of the U.S. environmental protection agency prior
to commitment or expenditure of the retained funds. The remaining twenty
percent (20%) of the funds retained by the city may be utilized for any
authorized use established by the city. (Ord. 181, 3-1-1976)
7-6-3-6: REVIEW OF RECORDS:
Upon request from EPA, the city shall encourage each industrial user to permit
representatives of the U.S. environmental protection agency to review
appropriate industrial sewage records for the purpose of independently
verifying the flow and characteristics of industrial wastes which are
introduced into the treatment works. No waste introduced into the waste
treatment system shall interfere with the operation or performance of the
sewage treatment works. All users are subject to the requirements of
pretreatment standards established by federal and state law. (Ord. 181, 3-1-
1976)

create offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, glare, fire
hazards and other objectionable influences, to those areas which are
appropriate therefor.
   (B)   To provide adequate space in appropriate locations for all types of
manufacturing and related activities so that economic structure of the
community may be strengthened, and that employment opportunities may be found
in the interest of public prosperity and welfare.

accessible to rail and highways, so that the movement of raw materials,
finished products and employees can be carried on efficiently and with a
minimum of danger to public life and property.

obnoxious manufacturing activities while at the same time encourage and permit
the manufacturing activities which have adopted facilities for the processing
of finished products without adversely affecting the health, happiness, safety,
convenience and welfare of the people living and working in nearby areas.
   (E)   To protect manufacturing districts from incompatible uses of land by
prohibiting the use of such space for new residential development, thereby
preserving the land for a more appropriate use in accordance with the plans for
city improvement and development.
   (F)   To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well
considered plan of land use for all of the city, to conserve the use of

9-8-3: Conditions Of Approval
9-8-4: Procedure
9-8-1: PURPOSE:
The principal objective of this comprehensive zoning title is to provide for an
orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses, and for the proper
location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of
the city. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified
as permitted in one or more of the various districts established by this title.
However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in
each district, there are certain additional uses which it may be necessary to
allow because of their unusual characteristics or the service they provide the
public. These "special uses" require particular consideration as to their
proper location in relation to adjacent established or intended uses, or to the
planned development of the community. The conditions controlling the location
and operation of such "special uses" are established by the following
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 233, 7-3-1978)
9-8-2: PERMITTED SPECIAL USES:
The city council of the city shall have authority to permit by special
ordinance, the following uses of land or structures, or both, subject to
conditions contained herein if it finds that the proposed location and
establishment of any such use will be desirable or necessary to the public
convenience or welfare and will be harmonious and compatible with other uses
adjacent to and in the vicinity of the selected site or sites:
Airport, land field, or land strip in any use district subject to the civil
aeronautics administration certifying that a new or reoriented runway will not
interfere with the flight pattern of any established airport, landing field or
landing strip.

Schools; elementary, high and college, public or private, in any R district,
but not including trade or commercial schools operated for profit.
Stable, livery, in any B-2 or M district.

"manufacturing". As a condition of approving any such special use, the city may
require the applicant to complete any and all public works improvements on said
property as the city council deems necessary for the public safety and welfare.
Telephone exchange, antenna towers, and other outdoor equipment essential to
the operation of the exchange in any R-3 district in addition to the B and M
districts where such facilities are permissive uses.
Trailer camps (house trailers or mobile homes) or trailer parks, in any R-3, B-
2 or M district. (Ord. 233, 7-3-1978; amd. Ord. 344, 9-15-1987)
9-8-3: CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL:
The plan commission may recommend, and the city council may impose, such
restrictions upon the height, bulk and area of lot coverage of any structure so
approved for special use as may be reasonable under the particular
circumstances; provided, that such restrictions and stipulations shall not be
more restrictive than the requirements established for the district in which
such structure is proposed to be located, or as may be required in any other
municipal code. Off street parking facilities as well as off street loading and
unloading spaces may also be stipulated in the order permitting the special
use. (Ord. 233, 7-3-1978)

pertinent information presented at the public hearing shall be made and
maintained by the plan commission as part of the permanent record relative to
the application.
   (C)   Determination: The plan commission shall then make its findings and
recommendations to the city council within thirty (30) days following the date
of public hearing on each application. The city council may then authorize a
special use as defined herein by specific ordinance; provided, the evidence
that is presented is such as to establish beyond a reasonable doubt:
      1.   The proposed use at the particular location requested is necessary
or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the interest of
public convenience and will contribute to the general welfare of the
neighborhood or community;
      2.   Such use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case,
be detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of persons
residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property values or
improvement in the vicinity; and
      3.   The proposed use will comply with the regulations and conditions
specified in this title for such use, and with the stipulations and conditions

institutional property. Such wall, fence or hedge shall be at least four feet
(4'), but not more than seven feet (7') in height and shall be maintained in
good condition.
      9.   Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate an off street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining properties.

required loading berth shall be located within twenty five feet (25') of the
nearest point of intersection of any two (2) streets. Loading berths open to

street loading berths results in a requirement of a fractional berth, any
fraction up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded, and fractions
over one-half (1/2) shall be interpreted as one loading berth.
   (D)   Surfacing: All open off street loading berths shall be improved with a

the regulations of this title and all building and health laws and regulations
of the city 1 .
All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plat in
duplicate drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the lot or lots to be
built upon, the size of the building or structure to be erected or structurally
altered, its location on the lot or lots and such other information as may be
necessary to provide for the enforcement of these regulations. A careful record
of such applications and plats shall be kept in the office of the building
inspector.
Architectural plans are to be provided for all new commercial construction and

the planning commission. Remodeling not involving life safety or structural
alterations on existing residential buildings are exempt from the need to
provide architectural plans.
   (B)   Certificate Of Compliance: No building or structure hereafter erected
or structurally altered shall be occupied and used until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the building inspector. The certificate of
compliance shall be issued only after the building inspector makes a finding
that the building or a structure has been erected or structurally altered in
conformance with the provisions of this title and other health and building
laws and in accordance with a building permit.
Certificates of compliance shall be applied for coincident with the application
for a building permit and shall be issued within ten (10) days after the
erection and alteration of such building shall have been satisfactorily
completed. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of
the building inspector and copies shall be furnished, on request, to any person
having proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected.
   (C)   Certificate For Continued Occupancy Of Nonconforming Uses:
Certificates for the continued occupancy of nonconforming uses existing at the

thereof now or hereafter erected or structurally altered, or in the use of land
now or hereafter occupied, without a use permit having first been issued by the
building inspector. No such use permit shall be issued to make such change
unless it is in conformity with the provisions of this title and amendments
hereto, hereafter duly enacted 2 .
   (E)   Continuance Of Existing Uses: Nothing in this title shall prevent the
continuance of the present occupancy or lawful use of any existing building or
zoning lot, except as may be necessary for the safety of life and property and

all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was
taken.
   (B)   Stay Of Proceedings: The appeal shall stay all proceedings and
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector
certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in
his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property; in which case, the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the zoning board of appeals or by court of record on application,
with notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and all due causes
shown.
   (C)   Hearing: The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time and

9-15-1: INTENT:
This chapter is intended to provide the means and the guidelines through which
tracts of land may be developed through an overall approach, rather than the
traditional lot by lot treatment afforded by other districts in this title. It
is intended to provide a maximum of design freedom by permitting the developer
an opportunity to more fully utilize the physical characteristics of the site
through the reduction of lot sizes, yard, height and bulk restrictions and the
planned mixing of uses. Through the requirements of a development plan, it is
the intent that property under this chapter will be developed through a unified
design providing continuity between the various elements and ultimately leading
to a better environment. Increased residential densities may be permitted under
this chapter if such increases can be substantiated on the basis that the
superior design makes greater densities possible with no reduction of
amenities. This chapter is not intended as a panacea, and should not be
utilized as a device for making increased densities more palatable, or as a
means of circumventing the city's development regulations. This chapter should
only be employed in instances where there is truly some benefit for the
community to be derived from its use. (Ord. 621, 12-18-2006)
9-15-2: PURPOSE:
In addition to the general purpose of this chapter, the purpose of this section
is to establish standards and procedures for planned unit developments, in
order that the following objectives may be obtained:
   (A)   Variety and flexibility in land development that is necessary to meet
with the best interests of the entire city.
   (B)   The allocation, maintenance, and permanent preservation of common open
space, recreation areas and facilities; to offer recreational opportunities
close to home, to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the conservation
of natural resources.
   (C)   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public
by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other sections of this chapter, as well as the subdivision
regulations.
   (D)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features, air and water quality, and other natural resources and
amenities.
   (E)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development and design, and the construction of
aesthetic amenities.
   (F)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings and other facilities.
   (G)   Land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort and
welfare.
   (H)   Innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial development so
that growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type,
design, and layout of space ancillary to said buildings. (Ord. 621, 12-18-2006)
9-15-3: APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
   (A)   Confer With Planning Commission: A planned development shall be
granted as a special use permit, in accordance with standards and procedures of
the Momence zoning ordinance, and may depart from the normal procedures and
requirements of this chapter and the subdivision regulations. Applications
shall be accompanied by the required plats, documents, and other data. Before
submitting an application for a planned unit development, an applicant may
confer with the planning commission to obtain information and guidance, before
entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial materials; provided,
however, that no such preapplication conference shall result in any binding
commitments on behalf of the applicant or the city.
   (B)   Preapplication Conference: The following procedures shall be required
for all planned developments:
      1.   Planning Commission: Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of a planned development, the applicant shall request a preapplication
conference with the planning commission. The request for a preapplication
conference shall be submitted to the director of planning and code enforcement.
      2.   Purpose: The purpose of the preapplication conference and the
presentation is to make advice and assistance available to the applicant before
presentation of the sketch development plan, so that the applicant may
determine:
         (a)   Whether the proposed planned development appears in general to
be in compliance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance and other
applicable ordinances;
         (b)   Whether any zoning amendment or variance is required in
connection with the proposed development;
         (c)   Whether the proposed planned development will be in conformity
with land use policies and objectives of the city. (Ord. 621, 12-18-2006)
9-15-4: SKETCH DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
   (A)   Intent: This section is intended to provide a process through which
the plan commission may determine if the proposed development is of adequate
merit, and thereby complies with the purpose of this chapter. Developments of
twenty (20) acres or less shall submit both sketch and preliminary development
plans prior to a public hearing. Developments in excess of twenty (20) acres
shall submit preliminary and final sketch plans separately over the prescribed
period of time, unless the city waives this procedure by official resolution of
the city council.
   (B)   Requirements: Application for a planned development shall be executed
by, or on behalf of, the landowner, and filed in triplicate, accompanied by ten
(10) copies of a sketch development plan. A filing fee in accordance with the
fee ordinance to cover all professional services shall be submitted to the city
clerk along with the following information:
      1.   Ownership: The entire site of the planned unit development shall be
under single ownership, and/or unified control as demonstrated by a description
of legal responsibility as necessary to effectuate and maintain the plan.
      2.   Minimum Size: The site of the planned unit development shall be
determined on a case by case basis by recommendation of the planning commission
and approval of the city council during the sketch development plan phase of
the approval process. The developer/property owner shall provide sufficient
evidence to show the size of the property is sufficient for the proposed use(s)
and type of development.
      3.   Uses: The planned unit development may include any or all uses
permitted within any of the existing zoning districts or a mixture thereof;
provided that the uses permitted in the planned development shall be of a type
and so located as to exercise no undue detrimental influence upon the
surrounding properties, and shall be compatible each with the other within the
planned unit development.
      4.   Notice Of Hearing: Names and addresses of the persons to whom
notices of hearing hereunder may be sent including the subdivider, the designer
of the subdivision, and the owners of the land immediately adjoining the land
to be platted.

    DISTRICT PARKS: Large active and passive recreational areas generally
located on or near thoroughfares and within two (2) miles of each residence
intended to be served. District parks generally adjoin junior and senior high
schools and often include such facilities as swimming pools, tennis complexes,
recreational building and adequate off street parking.
   NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS: Active and passive recreational areas which usually
serve children and adults in an urban area within a radius of approximately
one-half (1/2) mile. Neighborhood parks generally adjoin public elementary
schools and may include such features as ball diamonds and play area toward the
interior of the site so the perimeter can be landscaped to buffer sound and
provide a measure of safety to the public.
   PERMANENT COMMON OPEN SPACE: Parkways, medians, landscaped green space, or
other similar areas, defined as recreational areas.
   PLAY LOTS: Active recreational areas intended for children up to six (6) or
seven (7) years of age. Play lots generally feature play apparatuses, benches,
sand areas and landscaping. Play lots should be located near the center of the
housing areas generating children of such ages so that children need not cross
arterial streets to reach play lots.
   RECREATION AREA: Land specifically designed and intended for the active or
passive recreational use of the residents of the planned development and shall
include, but not be limited to: public or private play lots and parks; school
sites; storm water detention or retention areas if the planning commission
determines that such areas are capable of being utilized for multipurpose
recreational activities; pedestrian corridors; bicycle trails; greenbelts; and
open space networks.
   (B)   Designation:
      1.   The planning commission shall determine, in its reasonable
discretion, whether land is designated and intended for the recreational use of
residents of the planned development and in so doing shall consider the
following factors:
         (a)   The relationship of the location of the land being considered to
the residential use area which it is intended to serve.
         (b)   The size and usability of the land being considered.
         (c)   Other existing or proposed recreational facilities capable of
fulfilling recreational needs of the residents.
      2.   Within the percentage limitations set forth for residential land use
above, the developer should, to the extent that good planning allows, provide
such recreational space in the nature of play lots, neighborhood parks,
generally in accordance with the following standards, and should deviations
from the following standards be required, the planning commission may vary
these requirements by five percent (5%):
 
Classification     Approximate Size Acres Per
                                    1,000 People
                                   
Play lots          Up to 1 acre     1.0
Neighborhood parks 4 – 10 acres   6.0
District parks     10 – 20 acres  3.0
 
   (C)   Maintenance Of Common Open Space And Recreation Areas: In the event
that the organization established to own and maintain common open space and
recreation areas and related facilities or any successor organization, shall,
at any time after establishment of the planned development, fail to maintain
the common open space and recreation areas and related facilities in reasonable
order and condition in accordance with the plan, the city may serve written
notice upon such organization or upon the residents of the planned development
setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such
deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days thereof, and shall
state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within
fourteen (14) days of the notice. At such hearing the city may modify the terms
of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time
within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original
notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be cured within said thirty
(30) days or any extension thereof, the city, in order to preserve the taxable
values of the properties within the planned development and to prevent the
common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said property
and maintain the same for a period of one year.
Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space or recreation areas when the same is voluntarily dedicated to
the public by the owners. Before the expiration of said year, the city shall,
upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore
responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing
upon notice to such organization, or to the residents of the planned
development to show cause why such maintenance by the city shall not, at the
election of the city, continue for a succeeding year. If the city council shall
determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said common open
space and recreation areas at the end of said year, then such matter shall be
discontinued. If the city council shall determine that such organization is not
ready and able to maintain said common open space and recreation areas in a
reasonable condition, the city may, in its discretion, continue to maintain
said common open space during the next succeeding year and subject to a similar
hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. The decision of the city
council in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision
subject to review in accordance with appropriate provisions of this chapter.
The cost of such maintenance by the city shall be assessed ratably against the
properties within the planned development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space and recreation space and shall become a tax lien on said
properties. The city at the time of entering upon said property for the purpose
of maintenance, shall file an appropriate notice of such lien upon the
properties affected by such lien within the planned development. (Ord. 621, 12-
18-2006)
9-15-14: PERMITS:
Building, zoning and occupancy permits shall be required for each structure in
a planned development. No building permit relating to any part of a planned
development shall be issued prior to the approval of a final plan or such part
of the planned development; provided, however, that subject to the approval of
the village, excavation operations (construction of sewer, water and other
utility improvements) may proceed at any time following approval of the
preliminary development plan. (Ord. 621, 12-18-2006)
9-15-15: EFFECT OF DENIAL OF A SPECIAL USE:
No application for a special use, which has been denied wholly or in part by
the city council, shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date
of said order of denial except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of conditions found to be valid by the planning commission and the city
council. (Ord. 621, 12-18-2006)

   (A)   Public Streets To Be Provided: A public street shall be provided for
convenient access to all property within the subdivision. No private street or
thoroughfare shall be permitted.
   (B)   Street Layout: The street layout of the subdivision shall be in
general conformity with the official map of the most advantageous development
of adjoining areas in the entire neighborhood. The streets shall be designed
and located in relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical
conditions and natural terrain features, such as streams and existing street
growth, to public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to
the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
   (C)   Other Requirements: All streets in a subdivision abutting a state or
county highway shall meet all the requirements of the state or county
regulations pertaining thereto as well as meeting the requirements of this
title. Where such requirements are in conflict, the most restrictive shall
apply.
   (D)   Parallel Streets Required: Where a subdivision borders on or contains
a railroad or highway, the plan commission may require a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such railroad or highway, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
   (E)   Public Streets In Subdivisions: Whenever a tract to be subdivided
embraces any part of a public street so designed in the comprehensive plan and
official map, such part of such street shall be platted by the subdivision at
the location and width indicated on the plan.
   (F)   Street Classification: Highway, major collector and local streets as
classified in this subsection shall be as shown and designed in the official
map.
      1.   Highway: Those state, county and village designated routes which
provide continuity of travel and freedom from hazards and congestion necessary
for interregional and city traffic movement.

importance in intra-city traffic movement and necessary to provide easy access
to neighboring communities.
      3.   Collector Street: Those primary streets within the neighborhood unit
which will act to collect traffic from minor streets for travel to major
streets and highways.
      4.   Local Street: Those streets whose prime function is to give access
to abutting property. They are not intended to carry heavy through traffic and
are designed to discourage such movement.
      5.   Marginal Access Street: Those local streets which serve to control
access to major thoroughfares and permit development of lands adjacent to high
speed and high capacity highways. Their primary function is property access.
   (G)   Proposed Streets: Provision shall be made so that all proposed streets
shall have a direct connection with or be continuous and in line with existing,
planned, or platted streets with which they are to connect.
   (H)   Extension Of Streets: Where, in the opinion of the plan commission, it
is necessary and desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing or more advantageous future layout for
development of adjacent land, to extend streets within the proposed
subdivision, those streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
proposed street construction, including grades, horizontal curves, vertical
curves, and tangents, within the proposed subdivision, shall be in accordance
with the "minimum standard for street design" in title 7, chapter 9 of this
code.
   (I)   Street Names: New street names shall not duplicate the names of
existing streets, but streets that are continuations of others already in
existence shall bear the name of the existing street. All new streets shall be
subject to the approval and guidelines of the plan commission.

terminate in a turnaround or tee terminus. A turnaround shall have a right of
way of not less than one hundred forty feet (140') in diameter and a paved
roadway turnaround of one hundred ten feet (110') in diameter. Cul-de-sac
streets shall not exceed five hundred feet (500') in length as measured from
center of the turnaround to the center of the intersection.
   (K)   Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations and where the plan commission finds it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
   (L)   Intersections:
      1.   Streets shall be designed with no jogs or offsets less than one
hundred twenty five feet (125'). Where streets intersect highways, their
alignment shall be continuous.
      2.   Streets shall intersect in a manner to ensure safe traffic flow,
preferably at right angles, but in no case shall two (2) streets intersect with
an acute angle of less than sixty degrees (60°).
   (M)   Alleys:

right of way conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse and
shall include such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate
for the purpose and as determined by the plan commission. A minimum of ten feet
(10') shall be provided on either side of the ditch measured from the top of
the bank away from the centerline of the drainageway. Parallel streets or
parkways may be required in connection therewith.
   (D)   When a subdivision drainage plan proposes use of detention basins or
ponds which are to be dedicated for public use, provision shall be made that a
public access be possible through extension of a public access easement to
connect the facility to a public street. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
10-4-7: BUILDING SETBACK LINES:
Building setback lines in residential areas of new subdivisions shall conform
to the front yard provisions of the Momence zoning ordinance, except that in no
case shall the building setback line be less than twenty five feet (25') from
the front property line.

features including:
   (A)   Trees;
   (B)   Commercial landscaping. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
10-4-10: SCHOOLS AND PARKS:
Where deemed essential by the plan commission upon consideration of the
particular type of development proposed in the subdivision, the plan commission
may recommend and the city council require the dedication or reservation of
land for park and recreational purposes and land for school site(s), to serve
the immediate and future needs of the residents of the parcel, to make a cash
contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or to provide a combination of
both at the option of the city. Such dedications are necessary to ensure proper
provision of park and school sites for persons who are expected to reside
within the subdivision or development, which sites would otherwise have to be
acquired at the expense of the general public but whose utility would generally
be limited to residents of the parcel.
   (A)   Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreation Land Dedication:
      1.   Calculation: The subdivider may be required to dedicate for park and
recreation purposes an amount of land determined on the basis of eight (8)
acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. This calculation shall be based upon
3.5 persons per single-family dwelling unit.
      2.   Location; On Site Storage:
         (a)   Location: The location of the site to be dedicated will be
determined by the city council upon recommendation.
         (b)   On Site Storage: No storage of materials, including spoil
materials or top soil will be allowed on a park site designed for recreational
use or land designated as future or proposed school sites.
      3.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: Private open
space or recreation areas may be utilized in lieu of dedication required by
this subsection (A) provided that detailed improvement plans shall be approved
by the plan commission and city council and that satisfactory guarantees of the
permanency of the use and its maintenance, enforceable by the city, shall be
entered into by the subdivider.
   (B)   Criteria For School Site Provision: Subdividers may be required to
begin negotiations with the school district to determine requirements for
school site locations or cash contributions to ease the impact of a proposed
development. The subdivider shall provide a written statement to the city that
an agreement has been reached regarding any future school sites or
contributions to the school district.
   (C)   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Park And School
Sites:
      1.   Cash Contribution: When the resulting site in a proposed subdivision
or development is too small to be usable for the purpose intended or where it
is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site, the city
may require the subdivider to contribute cash in lieu of land dedication. The
cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held
in trust by the city or other public body designated by the city, solely for
the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which
will serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision
or development or the improvement of other existing park and recreation land
which already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites
shall be held in trust by the city, or other public body designated by the
city, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the
immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or
for the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such
needs, but not for the construction of any school buildings or additions
thereto. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation
land dedication or cash contribution in lieu of school site(s) is not expended
for the purpose set forth herein within seven (7) years from the date of
receipt, it will be refunded to the subdivider who made such contribution.
      2.   Fair Market Value: The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be
based on the fair market value of the acres of land as improved, that otherwise
would have been dedicated as park and recreation sites. The subdivider shall
submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land or
other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair market value per
acre of such improved land shall be made by the city council based upon such
information from other sources which may be submitted to the city council by
any local park district, school district or others.
   (D)   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: There will be situations
when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are
both necessary. These occasions will arise when:
      1.   A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has
already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the
subdivision or development to complete the site. The portions needed to
complete the park or school site shall be dedicated, and cash contribution will
be required in lieu of the balance of the required dedication.
   (E)   Improved Sites: The slope, topography and geology of the site to be
dedicated as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not
differ greatly from the surrounding land. Before dedication, all sites shall be
improved with a vigorous stand of grass. The grass shall be a mixture of
bluegrass, fescue, and rye as approved by the city engineer. The applicant/
developer shall be responsible for all maintenance of the site until the site
is accepted by the city, or acceptable provisions shall be made for such
improvement before dedication. (Ord. 455, 4-21-1997)
