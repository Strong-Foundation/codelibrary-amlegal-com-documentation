of buildings or structures or the use of land, imposes upon him, practical
difficulties or particular hardship, then the Board of Appeals may recommend
such variances of the strict application of the terms of the zoning chapter as
are in harmony with its general purpose and intent when the Board is satisfied,
under the evidence heard before it, that such a variance will not merely serve
as a convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some
demonstrable hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variance from the
provisions of the zoning chapter, or in the following instances:
      (1)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record prior to the date
of passage of the zoning chapter.

required by the zoning chapter, but such variation shall not exceed 25% of the
depth of front yard, or the depth of the rear yard, or the width of the side
yard, as required by the zoning chapter.
      (3)   To permit a building to exceed the height limit by not more than
10% of the height limit established by the zoning chapter.
      (4)   To permit the use of a lot less in area by not more than 20% of the

not more than 50% of the lot area as required by the zoning chapter.
      (7)   To interpret the provisions of the zoning chapter where the street
layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the
zoning chapter of the city fixing the several districts.
   (B)   In considering all proposed variations to the zoning chapter, the
Board shall, before recommending any variation from the zoning chapter in a
specific case, first determine and make a finding of fact that the property in
question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to use used only under
the conditions allowed by the regulations in that zone; the plight of the owner
is due to unique circumstances; and the variance, if granted, will not alter
the essential character of the locality. A variance shall be permitted only if
the evidence, in the judgment of the Board of Appeals, sustains each of the
three conditions enumerated; and further, the proposed variation will not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, unreasonably
increase the congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire or
endanger the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the
public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the inhabitants of the
city.
   (C)   No variance shall be made except in a specific case and after a public
hearing before the Board of Appeals of which there shall be a notice of the
time and place of the hearing published at least once, not more than 30 days
nor less than 15 days before the hearing, in one or more newspapers published
in the city. This notice shall contain the particular location for which the
variance is requested as well as a statement of what the proposed variance
consists.
   (D)   The Board shall report its findings and recommendations to the Council
within 15 days after the public hearing.

   (A)   No variance in any specific case shall be made by the Council without
a hearing by the Zoning Board of Appeals as required herein nor without a
report thereof having been made by the Board to the Council, and every such
report shall be accompanied by a finding of fact specifying the reasons for the
report.
   (B)   Upon the report of the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Council, without
further public hearing, may adopt or deny any proposed variation or may refer
the report back of the Board for further consideration. Any proposed variation
which fails to receive the approval of four members of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of
all elected members of the Council. In making any variances, the Council shall
be governed by the same considerations and restrictions as the variations in
particular instances under §
33.062.

being reserved to the Council, and the Board shall not have any power or
authority with respect to any alterations or change of the zoning chapter
except to make recommendations to the City Council in such specific cases as
may properly come before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

('71 Code, § 1-26-1) (Am. Ord. 3641, passed 6-14-10)
§ 37.02 UNRESTRICTED FUND BALANCE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The City Council finds it to be necessary to amend regulations
regarding appropriate level of unrestricted reserves for certain funds of the
city. Suggested guidelines in the literature related to government finance,
from the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), the National Advisory
Council on State and Local Budgeting Practice (NACSLBP), Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and other sources, were originally reviewed.
Equally important review included past experience in spending and fund balances
for the city, since each municipality has a unique pattern of services,
revenues, and expenditures.
   (B)   The literature on the topic recommends a policy related to
unrestricted fund balance in any given fund should consider many factors,
including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Predictability of revenue sources and the volatility of
expenditures. Unpredictable fluctuations in revenues or operating expenses
tends to require larger unrestricted fund balance to deal with the high degree
of variability.
      (2)   Perceived exposure to significant one-time outlays such as
disasters, immediate capital needs, reduction in revenues due to change in
legislation or volatility of the political environment, or the chance to take
advantage of one-time opportunities.
      (3)   Potential drain upon the General Fund by availability of resources
in other funds of the city, along with existing fund balances in other funds
which may be dependent in some fashion on the General Fund for revenue.
      (4)   Liquidity of financial resources and timing of receipt of revenue.
      (5)   Commitments and assignments of existing portions of the
unrestricted balance in the General Fund.
      (6)   Ability to stabilize tax rates, to address temporary revenue
shortfalls, to maintain service levels, and in broad terms provide financial
stabilization.
   (C)   Fund operating ranges. All three funds listed below shall be operated
above a minimum unreserved fund balance range. In the event any of the
unreserved fund balances are less than the minimum balance indicated, the City
Council shall take actions in no less than three months from said event of
shortfall to either reduce fund expenditures, increase fund revenue, or some
combination thereof, to bring the unreserved fund balance back above the
minimum balance. Said time period to raise the balance back to the minimum
level shall be as practical as reasonably possible.
   (D)   Table of funds.
 
FUND         MINIMUM
General Fund 30% of the audited operating expenditures for the General Fund, as
             averaged over the prior three fiscal years.
Water Fund   25% of the audited operating expenditures for the Water Fund, as
             averaged over the prior three fiscal years.
Sewer Fund   25% of the audited operating expenditures for the Sewer Fund, as
             averaged over the prior three fiscal years.

priorities by the Council.

§ 37.06 PUBLIC FUNDS INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   The City Council has previously adopted an investment policy in
Resolution 4100.
   (B)   City of Kewanee Public Funds Investment Policy. It is always prudent
for any public unit to have an Investment Policy in place for the purpose of
safeguarding funds, equitably distributing the investments and maximizing
income of the governmental unit. The following policy is hereby promulgated for
use by the city.
   (C)   Scope of policy. This investment policy applies to the investment
activities of all funds under the jurisdiction of the city. This investment
policy shall also apply to any new funds or temporary funds placed under the
jurisdiction of the city. The Illinois State Statutes shall take precedence
except where this policy is more restrictive wherein this policy shall take
precedence.
   (D)   Objectives. The purpose of this investment policy is to establish cash
management and investment guidelines for the stewardship of public funds under
the jurisdiction of the city. The specific objectives of this policy shall be
as follows:
      (1)   Safety. The security of moneys, whether on hand or invested, shall
be the primary concern of the Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk in
selecting depositories or investments.
      (2)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to meet all operating requirements, which might be reasonably
anticipated.
      (3)   Return. The Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk shall seek to
attain a market average or better rate of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles, taking into account risk, constraints, cash flow, and legal
restriction on investment.
      (4)   Local considerations. The Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk
shall have preference to depositories located within the city provided that the
afore-described objectives are met, and such investments would be in compliance
with all other conditions and limitations of this investment policy; however,
the Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk may approve qualified
depositories regardless of location with the concurrence of the City Manager.
   (E)   Guidelines. To assist in attaining the stated objectives, the
following guidelines shall be observed:
      (1)   Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to insure
preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To avoid unreasonable risks
diversification of investments is required.
      (2)   The portfolio should remain sufficiently liquid to meet operating
requirements, which may be reasonably anticipated. Cash flows shall be reviewed
quarterly.
      (3)   To maximize earnings, all funds shall be deposited/invested within
two working days at prevailing rates or better.
      (4)   All investments shall be selected on the basis of competitive
proposals.

investment portfolio shall be consistent with the objectives in the investment
policy. Commercial paper shall not exceed 10% of the investment portfolio.

Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk is the direct responsibility of the
Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk. The Director of Accounts & Finance/

system of controls for all authorized subordinates who are directly involved in
the assistance of such investment activities.
   (H)   Performance measures (bench mark). The use of U.S. Treasury bills,
average Fed Fund rate. IPTIP, or other stable markets can be used to determine

establish annual independent review for internal control, which assures
compliance within the investment policy. This will be accomplished with
external auditors.
   (J)   Reporting. All investment transactions shall be recorded by the
Director of Accounts & Finance/City Clerk or their staff. A report will be
generated, at least weekly, listing all active investments, location of
investments, maturity of investments, interest rate and other pertinent
information deemed necessary. This report will be submitted monthly to the City
Manager and City Council.
   (K)   Investment vehicles. The city shall limit its investments to those
allowed by law as set out in ILCS Chapter 30, Act 235, § 2. A summary of

select which financial (IPTIP, banks, savings and loan, credit unions and other
non-banks) institutions shall be depositories for the city. Any financial
institution, upon meeting the requirements of the Illinois Compiled Statutes
and of this policy, may request to become a depository for the city. The city

service, fees, competitiveness, and the community relations involvement of the
financial institution when choosing depositories.
   (M)   Collateralization.

recyclables, and yard waste from their home, as further delineated herein. Also
addressed in this chapter is the operation of the city's Solid Waste Transfer
Station. The transfer station rates are set for solid waste that is not
municipal residential solid waste from Kewanee.
(Ord. 2852, passed 10-4-93; Am. Ord. 3347, passed 6-24-02)
§ 50.03 DEFINITIONS.

(Ord. 2852, passed 10-4-93)
§ 50.04 RESIDENTIAL REFUSE AND GARBAGE PICKUP.
   (A)   Collection of refuse and garbage shall be performed once each week at
each residential dwelling unit in the city that is being provided water service
from the city, and outside the city limits as deemed by staff to be a
reasonable extension of existing collection routes. This collection shall not
start before 6:00 a.m. Weeks containing holidays and unforeseen emergencies may
require alteration of the schedule. Collection shall be on the same day of the
week for each established collection district, except for emergencies and
holidays. The city shall give notice to the public of any changes to the pickup
schedule. Carts and recycling shall be placed out for collection no sooner than
noon of the day prior to scheduled collection. Carts shall be rolled back to
private property as soon as possible after collection, and no later than noon
of the day following collection. Carts placed out for collection prior to this
time or not rolled back, shall be considered littering and subject to penalty
for same.
   (B)   Provision and use of standardized carts. The city will provide, free
of charge, one standardized 95-gallon refuse cart for use by residential
customers. Carts will be embossed with a unique serial number and RFID tag
which will be recorded in a city database for each household. Every residential
customer receiving refuse service from the city shall be required to use the
city-provided standardized carts. The cart weight must not exceed 150 pounds.
   (C)   Out-of-cart set outs. Residents are required to place all household
refuse inside the cart except as follows: residents will be allowed to set out
two additional 32-gallon bags, free of charge, on the first scheduled
collection after Christmas.
   (D)   Second cart for residential customers. Large households may require an
additional cart. Additional carts will be distributed and collection charged at
the same rate as the initial cart (two times base rate). No more than one
request per year for an additional cart.
   (E)   Second cart return policy. Residents who have two carts may opt to
switch back to one cart at any time, thereby returning their monthly rate to
the original one-cart rate. Residents must notify the City Utility Billing
Clerk of their desire to return their second cart at least seven days in
advance. The city will schedule to pick up the cart and confirm the cart is in
good working condition. The customer will be charged a cart return fee of $15
plus any cost of repairing the cart if damaged, not to exceed the replacement
cost of the cart.
   (F)   Theft/vandalism of carts. Carts that are stolen or vandalized will be
replaced or repaired free of charge by the city. Households that report more
than two thefts or vandalized carts over a one-year period may be required to
pay for the cost of repair, not to exceed replacement cost, prior to receiving
a replacement cart.
   (G)   Cart care and use. All refuse shall be placed in bags prior to deposit
in the carts. Lids on carts should be kept closed at all times to prevent
windblown litter, access to animals, and pooling of rainwater inside the cart.
Carts shall not be filled in excess of 150 pounds. Dirt, rocks, and concrete
shall not be placed in the carts. Hot coals/embers and household hazardous
waste (chemicals, motor oil, paint, and the like) should not be placed in the
carts. Dimensional lumber and large household items shall not be physically
forced into the cart, but first must be dismantled or cut down to a size and
shape that fits easily in the cart with the lid closed. Residents who place
these materials in carts in such a manner that damage is caused to the cart or
to the collection vehicle, or otherwise use the carts for other purposes that
result in damage to the cart, shall be liable for the replacement cost of the
cart and/or repairs to the collection vehicle, as well as a $15 new cart
delivery fee.
   (H)   Cart storage. Carts may be stored in the garage, carport, shed, or
under cover of the household. Carts may also be stored outdoors to the side or
rear of the household, but may not be stored in the front yard unless they are
not visible from the street.
   (I)   Cart set out placement. Carts shall always be set at the curb with the
lids closed and with no material on top of the lids. Carts shall be placed
within three feet of the curb. The most common placement is at the end of the
driveway near the street. Carts shall not be placed within four feet of trees,
mailboxes, vehicles, power poles, or other curbside impediments to either side
of the cart (including another cart). Carts shall not be blocked by parked
cars, as the automated collection vehicle needs room to maneuver the automated
arm to collect the cart without risk to personal property. Carts that are
placed too close to cars or impediments may result in the trash not being
collected. Carts should be placed with the lid opening facing the street (the
handle should face away from the street).
   (J)   Tampering with carts. Carts are the sole property of the city. It
shall be unlawful for any person to deface a city-provided cart in any way, to
cause damage to a cart by either intent or negligence, or to remove a cart,
with the intent of theft, from the residence or residential customer to which
it was provided by the city. No unauthorized person shall open, pilfer,
disturb, or remove a cart that has been set out for collection or otherwise
scatter or disperse the contents thereof. No person shall remove or leave open
the cart lid except for the purpose of depositing refuse therein or for the
cleaning thereof.
   (K)   Large item collection. Residential refuse customers may purchase a tag
from the City Clerk’s office and schedule an appointment for collection on a
Monday, excluding observed Holidays, for the removal of large items or white
goods (e.g., kitchen appliances, washers, dryers). Large items may only consist
of materials that may be accepted at the transfer station (e.g., chairs,
couches, and televisions). The following conditions must be adhered to:
      (1)   A tag must first be purchased from the City Clerk’s office for $10,
or the resident’s free transfer station dump coupon may be surrendered for two
large item pick ups, and the collection must be scheduled the week prior to
Monday upon which collection is desired;
      (2)   All items must be placed near the curb or street surface, but not
in a manner to interfere with moving traffic or to create a visibility hazard;
      (3)   Each item to be collected must have an appropriate tag and can
weigh no more than 500 pounds;
      (4)   White goods (e.g. refrigerators, freezers, dehumidifiers) may not
contain any Freon or other regulated gases when placed for collection;
      (5)   Any large item that has a door must be modified so the door may of
shut and become latched by either removing or securing shut before placement at
curb;
      (6)   Carpet will also be collected as long as it is cut into lengths no
greater than 5 ft., rolled and secured (tied).
   (L)   No scavenging of refuse. It shall be unlawful for any person or
persons to scavenge or in any way disturb, rummage through, overturn, or
scatter refuse, garbage, solid waste, or recyclable waste material that has
been placed by users for collection by the city. Violations of this section are
subject to penalty as provided in §
10.99 of this code.
   (M)   Free dump coupon.

         (a)   The free dump coupon shall be presented to the transfer station
operator and surrendered at the time of use.
         (b)   The weigh ticket resulting from use of the free dump coupon
shall be signed by, along with the printed name of, the person depositing the
rubbish.
         (c)   The signature shall be accompanied by a statement from the
person depositing the rubbish that the rubbish was generated at the address
printed on the free dump coupon.

annually.
      (3)   Falsification, copying, reproduction or tampering with a free dump
coupon with the intent to submit such falsified, copied, reproduced or tampered
item for service is unlawful.
      (4)    Anyone, whether user of the coupon, recipient of the coupon, or
both, found to be using the coupon in a manner inconsistent with the provisions
contained herein, shall forfeit all future rights to receive and/or use the
coupon, and shall further lose all rights to deposit rubbish at the solid waste
transfer station.
      (5)   All rights to deposit rubbish at the solid waste transfer station

      (4)   Acknowledging that the market for recyclables is subject to change,
the City Manager is authorized to include additional items for recyclable
collection in the event that the firm accepting the recyclables agree to accept

recycling collection location. Each collection in violation of this section
from each separate designated recycling collection location during that period
shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of this chapter.
      (3)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the right of an individual
person, organization, or other entity to donate, sell, or otherwise dispose of
recyclable waste material, if such disposal does not violate any applicable
statute, regulation, or ordinance.

§ 50.09 RATES AND RULES FOR SOLID WASTE PICKUP.
   (A)   As specified in this chapter for the management of residential solid
waste, to include refuse, curbside recycling, yard waste, and bulk brush, there
is established a service charge of $16.84 per month. This rate shall commence
and be effective for utility bills due on, or about, January 20, 2023, and
remain in effect until amended as follows:
 
Commencing with bills payable on, or Commencing with bills payable on, or about
about January 20, 2024               January 20, 2025
$18.34 per month                     $19.84 per month
 
   (B)   All users of residential dwelling unit water service within the city
shall be required to pay the service charge whether or not they use this solid
waste pick up service.
   (C)   The above service charge for apartment complexes of two to four units,
duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes shall be assessed for each unit of the
complex. Boarding houses shall be assessed three times the above service
charge.
   (D)   Excess tags. Excess tags sold to authorize the collection of landscape
waste bags will be $1.00 per excess tag when sold to individual users. To
encourage retail vendors to also sell such tags, thereby increasing ease of use
of the program, the cost to retail vendors re-selling the tags to users is
$0.95 per excess tag, sold only in lots with a minimum of 250 tags per lot.
   (E)   It shall be unlawful for any person who is not receiving solid waste
pick up service to place any solid waste with the solid waste of a resident who

for all rates and charges in connection with this chapter and to collect all
money due per this chapter.
   (G)   The City Manager shall have the authority to designate additional
collection agents which shall be financial institutions located within the city

§
50.99
§ 50.10 SOLID WASTE TRANSFER STATION.
   (A)   The operator of the transfer station may accept payment for the
delivery of solid waste or any other items that will be processed through the
transfer station. For all material delivered to the transfer station the
operator will either accept payment for the items delivered or accept items
without payment because the firm or person has been placed on a monthly payment
schedule as authorized by this chapter. In either case the transfer station
operator will give the delivery person a copy of a form documenting the
delivery to the transfer station with the original of the document forwarded to
the City Clerk for billing or filing. In the case of a cash payment the form
will be annotated as being paid along with the date of payment. At the end of
each day the transfer station operator will deliver to the City Clerk all
monies collected along with all weight tickets and shall certify to the City
Clerk that all deliveries to the transfer station for that day are balanced out
against the total deliveries for the city plus cash and credit deliveries. The
operator will also deliver to the City Clerk a daily cash register tape showing
the total cash received in the register. The City Manager will specify the
form.
   (B)   Hauling equipment.
      (1)   Commercial haulers of solid waste using the city's Solid Waste
Transfer Station will use leak proof collection equipment, which shall be so
maintained that offensive orders, drippings, and scattering of refuse shall be
avoided.
      (2)   Every vehicle hauling or transporting any solid waste to or for
deposit in the Kewanee transfer station shall do so in either a vehicle that
completely encloses the debris or waste, or by a covered means of conveyance
thereof, such as with a tarp or other like material so that at no time shall
any of the solid waste so hauled be dropped, spilled, or allowed to fall or
blow onto a public way or on to the public property on and around the transfer
station. Any person refusing or failing to comply with this requirement shall
be in violation of this chapter and shall be assessed a fifty dollar ($50) fee
in addition to other dumping charges, and may also be denied admittance to or
use of the Kewanee transfer station until such time as he is in compliance with
this requirement. Such fee or prohibition shall not apply to city or contracted
vehicles participating in any Council-authorized community clean-up.
      (3)   Commercial equipment shall be maintained in a safe, efficient,
operating condition at all times. Trucks shall not be overloaded.
   (C)   Certification. If the transfer station is not permitted for regional
operations, each person bringing solid waste to the transfer station will sign
a certification that the solid waste was generated and collected within the
city. Commercial hauler will sign this certification annually. Disposing of
solid waste at the transfer station that is not generated and collected within
the city will not only subject the violator to the penalties associated with
this chapter, but also to all costs that may be associated with the recovery
and proper disposal of non-Kewanee solid waste. Any person violating the
provisions of this division shall be subject to a fine of not less than $400
and not more than $500.
   (D)   Weighing.
      (1)   The transfer station is equipped with an internal scale. The road
truck used to transport the solid waste to the landfill will normally be parked
on the scale in the lower level. Haulers of solid waste will use the upper
level to dump solid waste into the road truck on the lower level. The weight of
the road truck after and prior to receiving solid waste will be used to
calculate the number of tons delivered by the waste hauler.
      (2)   In the event the above weighing procedure cannot be followed or is
impracticable, then the transfer station operator shall use the volume of the
solid waste to determine the number of tons delivered by the waste hauler.
Three cubic yards of solid waste shall be considered to equal one ton. For
commercial haulers their trucks will be considered fully loaded to their rated
capacity when they deliver to the transfer station.
   (E)   Rates.
      (1)   Negotiated rate. The City Manager has the authority to negotiate
with both commercial solid waste haulers and the contractor who is transporting
the transfer station’s solid waste to the landfill in order to arrive at a rate
that is to the benefit of the city in regards to a long term contract with a
commercial hauler delivering solid waste to the transfer station. In order to
establish negotiated rates an agreement must be for a minimum of three years.
In addition the agreement will specify a minimum tonnage that must be
guaranteed to be delivered to the transfer station by the solid waste
collector. These negotiated rates shall be approved by the City Council.
      (2)   Special rate for construction and demolition waste. In some cases
it will be to the advantage of the city to allow this type of solid waste to be
moved directly from a site, such as a construction or demolition site, to the
landfill rather than using the transfer station as an intermediate handling
site. When, in his judgment, it is to the advantage of the city to establish
this special rate, the City Manager, or his designee, has the authority to
negotiate with both the contractor who has the contract for transporting the
city’s solid waste to the landfill and an individual or contractor who requires
solid waste removal at a particular site to establish a special rate for the
haulage of construction or demolition waste from a specific location to the
landfill. Wastes under this provision can only be the waste for which the
landfill is permitted to accept.
      (3)   Standard rate.
         (a) The standard rate will consist of a charge per ton of $60.90 with
a minimum disposal fee of $10.
         (b)   Hand carried garbage bags will be accepted with an excess trash
bag sticker attached.
         (c) The City Manager will increase the standard charge per ton by the
same dollar amount that the Contractor increases his charge to the city for
transporting solid waste to the landfill. This increase will be effective on
the same day on which the contractor’s charge to the city increases or when the
contractor, per his contract with the city, passes on to the city an increase
in federal, state, or local charges.
      (4)   Large household items and concrete and masonry. Large household
items such as bed springs, couches, and stuffed chairs will be accepted at the
transfer station. Appliances will not be accepted. If the transfer station
operator is in doubt about the acceptability of large household items he will
not accept the item. Concrete, masonry, bricks, and similar dense, non-
compressible materials, whether broken apart or in partial sub-assemblies, will
not be accepted.
      (5)   Tires. Tires can no longer be placed in landfills, accordingly the
transfer station operator must ensure that tires are not mixed in with the
trash that will be landfilled. Any hauler of solid waste to the transfer
station commingling tires with trash will be considered in violation of this
section and in addition to being required to remove the tires from the solid
waste bound for the landfill will be subject to the penalties of this code. The
transfer station operator may accept tires so long as they are placed on top of
the load being transferred to the landfill, thus allowing the landfill operator
to remove the tires prior to placing the trash in the landfill. Tires on rims
will not be accepted. The fee for each tire less than 17 inches in rim diameter
is $6 and the fee for each tire between 17 and 22 inches in rim diameter is $9.
Larger tires will not be accepted.

§ 50.11 BILLING AND PAYMENTS.
   (A)   Payment for municipal curb side services. Chapter 52 contains the
procedures for billing and payment for this service.
   (B)   Payment for large household items and tires. Payment for these items
per the prior section shall be made at the transfer station. These items will
not be accepted at the transfer station without prior payment at the transfer
station.
   (C)   Bills.
      (1)   Bills for municipal curb side solid waste pick up service shall be
sent out on the same cycle as the city water and sewer bills per
Chapter 52.
      (2)   Bills for solid waste disposal at the transfer station. Normally,
bills for solid waste disposal at the transfer station will be collected
immediately after the delivery at the transfer station.. The City Manager is
authorized to approve commercial solid waste collectors for payment of their
bills on a monthly basis, provided the City Manager is satisfied with their
credit rating. If the hauler's credit rating is unknown or not acceptable the
City Manager may allow the hauler to use the transfer station if the hauler
makes a deposit equal to the hauler's expected usage of the transfer station
over a two month period. The City Manager will determine the amount of the
deposit, such an amount to be held by the city to pay for any unpaid bills and
penalties specified in this chapter. The amount of the deposit will bear no
interest and will be refunded to the depositor upon written notification that
the depositor will no longer be using the transfer station or upon the
establishment of satisfactory credit rating as determined by the City Manager.
If the deposited funds are used to pay part or all of an overdue bill or
penalties, the deposit will be restored to its specified level and any
remaining bills and penalties will be paid before the transfer station can be
used by the specific hauler.
   (D)   Delinquent, nonpayment of bills, and termination. Procedures for
delinquent bills and utility termination are specified in
Chapter 52. Nonpayment of commercial bills incurred at the transfer station
will, at the option of the City Manager, in addition to penalties, result in
the commercial hauler not being allowed to use the transfer station or the
requirement of making a deposit in an amount determined by the City Manager
before use of the transfer station can be resumed.

§ 50.12 FUND ACCOUNTING.
   All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the solid waste pickup
and the operation of the transfer station shall be placed into a fund separate
and apart from private funds and separate and apart from all other funds of the
city by the City Clerk. All such moneys, without any deductions whatever, shall
be deposited into the treasury on a daily basis. The City Treasurer shall
receive all such revenues from the solid waste pick up and transfer station
operation services and all other moneys incident to the operation of such
services as the same may be delivered to him, and account for the same in a
fund separate from all other funds and designated as the “Solid Waste Fund,”
which shall be considered an enterprise fund.
(Ord. 2852, passed 10-4-93)
§ 50.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating the provisions of this chapter shall, unless
specified otherwise in this chapter, be subject to a fine of not less than $50
and not more than $500.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to limit the right of the city
or the city's authorized agent to bring a civil action against any person who
violates this chapter, nor shall a conviction for such violation exempt any
person from a civil action brought by the city or an authorized agent of the
city.

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 51.095 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for the service supplied by
the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge
established to pay administrative expenses of billing, collection, insurance
and such other expenses classified by the city as fixed expenses in the
operation and maintenance of the system; a basic user rate (OM&R) to pay all
remaining expenses, after administrative expenses, of the cost of operation,
maintenance and replacement of the system classified by the city as variable
expense; a debt service charge to pay 50% of the amount required annually for
interest and principal on outstanding sewer debt including bond and
depreciation reserve requirements thereon (reserves average 30% of annual
principal and interest requirements); and a surcharge, if applicable.
   (A)   The basic user charge shall be determined by dividing the total of
fixed expenses as classified and determined by the city including
administrative salaries, office expense, insurance and other administrative
expense by the number of users connected to the system and subject to billing
for service. The annual cost so determined as a fixed expense per use shall be
designated as the basic user charge and shall be pro-rated over the number of
annual billing periods for the purpose of billing as the basic user charge.
Each bill shall be subject to the basic user charge.
   (B)   (1)   The basic user rate (OM&R) shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters for the purpose of paying variable costs associated
with the operation, maintenance and replacement of the system. The basic user
rate shall be determined by dividing the total of annual operation, maintenance
and replacement expense, (after deducting revenue derived from the basis user
charge) by the total number of cubic feet billed for sewer service in the
preceding year. This calculation shall produce a unit rate per 100 cubic feet
for sewer service supplied which shall be billed as the basic user rate.
      (2)   (a)   The basic user rate (OM&R) will be applicable for average and
below average strength sewage. Average strength sewage is determined to have
the following characteristics:
            1.   A five-day 20° C. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 200 mg/
l.
            2.   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
         (b)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs including
replacement and shall be computed as described above.
   (C)   The debt service charge shall consist of the total of a fixed rate
(the debt service charge) and a variable rate (the debt service rate). The debt
service charge shall be applied to each user connected to the sewerage system
of the city. The debt service rate shall be determined by dividing an amount
equal to 50% of annual principal and interest on sewer debt applicable to the
sewer system (this being the percentage applicable to the sewer system and not
the waterworks system) including 30% coverage thereon, less revenues received
from the debt service charge described above, by the total number of cubic feet
billed for sewer service in the preceding fiscal year.
   (D)   (1)   A surcharge, in addition to the above mentioned charges, will be
levied upon all users whose discharges exceed the average concentrations for
BOD5 (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters for all wastes which exceed the parameters outlined
above. Section
51.
097(E) specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge. The unit rate of BOD5
and SS surcharge calculations shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Proportion the estimated annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including the equipment replacement fund,
to the major plant categories.
         (b)   Proportion the costs of the major plant categories to BOD5 and
SS.
         (c)   Estimate pounds of BOD5 and pounds of SS.
         (d)   Compute the unit costs per pound of BOD5 and SS.
      (2)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed
annually and shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service
or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs.
      (3)   The users of wastewater treatment services will be notified
annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of
the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation,
maintenance and replacement.

§ 51.096 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing user charges and surcharges shall be
metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of 100 cubic feet.
   (A)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall, if directed by the Plumbing Inspector, install and maintain, at his
expense, water meters of a type approved by the Plumbing Inspector for the
purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
   (B)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the Plumbing Inspector.

§ 51.098 COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   Following is the procedure for calculating wastewater service charges for
users located within the corporate limits:
   (A)   Metered users. The wastewater service charge for metered users shall
be computed using the following formula:
      WC      =   B + V (OM&R) + DSC + V (DSR) + S
      Where WC   =   Amount of wastewater service charge in dollars per billing
period.
      B      =   Basic user charge for the payment of billing and
administrative expense (fixed expense)
      V      =   Water volume in 100 cubic feet per billing period to the
lowest increment of one 100 cubic feet.
      OM&R   =   Basic user rate for variable OM&R costs in dollars per 100
cubic feet.
      DSC      =   Debt service charge for the fixed charge applicable to
payment of debt service in dollars per billing period.
      DSR      =   Remaining debt service rate in dollars per billing period
for the remainder of debt service cost (after deducting revenues received from
the debt service charge), such remainder of debt service requirements will be
divided by total billable flow to compute the rate per 100 cubic feet.
      S      =   Amount of wastewater surcharge in dollars as computed by the
surcharge formula.
   (B)   Charge for septic waste disposal. The operator of the wastewater
treatment plant (WWTP) is authorized to accept septic waste from haulers. Each
hauler will be charged $36 per 1,000 gallons or for any part of a 1,000
gallons. Each hauler will certify the origin of the waste and provide a billing
address. The WWTP operator will forward to the City Clerk an invoice so that
the Clerk may send out a proper sewer bill to the hauler.

his heirs or future owners of the property to annex into the city should at any
time in the future the property become contiguous to the city. A water service
line can only service one property and cannot run across one property to
another property. The City Manager is authorized to sign such an agreement on
behalf of the city. This division shall not apply to the following two
properties which are considered to have applied for a water connection prior to
the effective date of this section and are allowed to have a single service
line to each property:

      (3)   Within one year of the passage of this section all water lines that
exist outside of the city and that are not owned and maintained by the city
will have installed a backflow prevention device per the cross-connection
control section of this chapter. As determined by the Superintendent of Water
the backflow prevention device shall be located as near as possible to the city
border. The city, at its discretion, may, at any time it desires, install a
stop valve on the city side of the backflow prevention device, such stop valve
being within the city limits. Should the owner of a water line outside of the
city limits fail to comply with this division, the city will install such a
backflow prevention device and charge the owner or owners for all material,
labor, and equipment used to install the device.
   (B)   Any future extensions of the city water main system outside of the
city limits is prohibited unless it is part of an annexation agreement.

§ 52.17 SUPERVISION; READING, TESTING, AND INSTALLATION OF METERS AND OSRS.
   (A)   The employees of the Public Works Department shall have free access at
all reasonable times to the premises of the consumer for the purpose of reading
the internal water meter or inspecting the piping and appurtenances connected
to the meter, which includes the wiring leading from the internal meter to the
external outside reading device (OSR) or similar remote reading device.
   (B)   Employees of the Public Works Department may remove the internal meter
the OSR, or similar remote reading device at any time for repair or for testing
and when any meter shall be found incorrect in its measurement and unfit for
further use, such internal meter, OSR, or similar remote reading device shall
be replaced at once by one approved by the Water Superintendent. The city shall
examine and test any water meter whenever it is determined that an unexplained
fluctuation has occurred in the billing contrary to past billing history. A
consumer may request such testing, or the testing may be initiated by the city,
however, in all cases the city shall determine when and if such testing will
occur. If the unexplained fluctuation continues over two billing cycles, the
meter shall be tested. Should the meter register more than or equal to 2% in
excess of the amount of water that actually passes through the same, the
customer's billing for the current and the most recent past billing period will
be adjusted downward by the percentage that the meter was found to be running
fast. Should the meter register more than 2% less than the amount of water that
actually passes through the meter the customer's billing for the current and
the most recent past billing period will be adjusted upwards by the percentage
that the meter was found to be running slow.
   (C)   The occupants of any building or premises where meters, OSRs, or
similar remote reading devices are located shall keep the same free from
obstruction and they shall be so arranged that it may be accessible at all
times for the purposes of reading, inspection, or repairing. Accessible is
defined as a minimum of two feet of clear space, in all directions, over,
under, and around the meter and/or OSR or similar remote reading device. If the
meter, OSR, or similar remote reading device is obstructed, the water will be
shut off until such obstruction is removed and the reconnection charge is paid.
   (D)   An OSR, or similar remote reading device will be installed for all
water customers. If an OSR, or similar remote reading device is not installed,
the owner or occupant of the premises will give reasonable access to employees
of the Public Works Department so that they may install an OSR, or similar
remote reading device. Under certain conditions the Public Works Director or
his designee may waive the requirement to install an OSR, or similar remote
reading device. This waiver will only be based on a unique construction
condition that would make the installation of an OSR, or similar remote reading
device cost prohibitive. Unless waived by the Water Superintendent, OSR, or
similar remote reading device will be installed in a manner recommended by the
manufacturer.

§ 52.21 APPLICATIONS FOR SERVICE CONNECTIONS; DEPOSIT.
   (A)   Applications for water or sewer connections must be made in writing to
the city upon forms provided by the city. A separate application will be made
for each service connection, each building, and each residence or business
place to be supplied. All applications shall contain the common address and
parcel number, when known, of the property to which service is requested to be
made and shall be signed by the owner of such property, or by the owner's
authorized agent, with satisfactory proof of such agency required, and the
tenant, if the tenant will be billed for such service. In such application, the
owner of the real property, or his authorized agent, and the tenant, if the
tenant is going to be billed for water service, must agree to be governed by
the provisions of this code in force at the time of the application, and as the
same may thereafter be amended. The making of such written application shall be
prima facie proof of the owner's agreement to be so governed and shall be
conclusive proof of such agreement in a court of law. If after the initial
application the tenant who is being billed for water service is replaced by
another tenant a new application must be submitted to the city by the new
tenant and landlord.
   (B)   Each application for water service received on, or after, June 1,
2007, shall be accompanied by a deposit of $125 as security for water service
to be furnished. Deposits for water service shall be maintained and accounted
for separately and shall be returned to the applicant without interest upon the
written request for the discontinuance of water service by the applicant. There
shall be deducted from said deposit any moneys due and owing to the city for
water service. The deposit will be waived when the applicant is the property
owner.

§ 52.22 PAYMENT OF BILLING; PROCEDURE; DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   The person in whose name service to a premises is billed, the occupant
of the premises, the owner of the premises, and the user of the service shall
be jointly and severally liable to pay for such service, and the service is
furnished to the premises by the city only upon the condition that said persons
are jointly and severally liable therefor to the city. Before relieving the
owner of the requirement to pay for a billing that is currently in the name of
the owner of the premises, a deposit of $125 must be paid by the tenant to the
city.
   (B)   Regular bill. Water, sewer, and solid waste service charges shall be
sent using a post card on or near the first day of the month succeeding the bi-
monthly period for which service was supplied. All bills for utility services
shall be due and payable for the period which the service is billed, not later
than the close of business on the twentieth day after bills have been sent. In
the event the customer fails to receive the original bill for services, and the
customer is in good standing with the city as defined herein, then the city
shall waive the late penalty. A customer in good standing is hereby defined as
not having more than one penalty for any account they were liable for in the
preceding three years.
   (C)   Penalty bill. If payment of the full amount of the bill is not made by
the due date of the post card bill, then a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
balance of the utility services bill will be added to the amount due and which
shall be the sole responsibility of the service user. The billing addressee
will be notified of the 10% penalty by the mailing of a post card, which will
allow an additional ten days for the bill plus the penalty to be paid. If the
billing addressee is a tenant, the owner will be sent a notice informing the
owner that the tenant is overdue on the utility services billing and the
consequences if the bill is not paid. If in the opinion of the City Manager or
his designee, the balance owed, is not of a sufficiently large amount to
justify the administrative costs required to collect said balance, the balance
can be retained on the account and will become payable on rendition of the next
bill. Such determination to retain balances on account will be made following
guidelines put forth by the City Manager in a Standing Order. Said Standing
Order may be amended from time to time as is determined by the City Manager to
be prudent. If upon expiration of the ten day grace period the bill remains
unpaid, the landlord may provide notice to the city, upon such form as provided
by the city, to suspend service. The city may proceed with termination of water
service upon expiration of the ten day grace period of the penalty bill unless
the person so notified shall request a hearing prior to the expiration of said
ten-day period. The hearing shall be held by the City Manager or a person
designated by him. Unless the hearing officer determines that the proposed
termination is not justified, or unless other arrangements for payment of the
bill are approved by the City Manager or his designee, the city may proceed
with termination of the water service on the date which shut off is to occur.
   (D)   Shut off. In the event the charges for utility services, penalties and
fees, are not paid by the penalty due date, such service shall be terminated
without further notice on the day after the penalty due date and shall not be
reinstated until all past-due bills, including the penalties thereon, are paid
in full or other arrangements for the retirement of the obligation are approved
by the City Manager or person designated by him. If the premises is occupied by
a tenant, the owner shall be informed in writing that the water has been shut
off and that the past-due bill, penalties, fees and the current bill must be
paid in ten days.
   (E)   Reconnection of service. In the event that water services are
terminated for nonpayment of rates or charges for water, sewer, or solid waste
services, there shall be a $40 reconnection fee paid for reconnecting such
service, plus all costs incurred in filing and recording of any lien upon the
real estate.
   (F)   Delinquent bill. In the event the charges for service are not paid as
required by this chapter such charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared
to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquencies shall constitute liens upon
the real estate for which such service was supplied, and the City Clerk is
hereby authorized to file sworn statements showing such delinquencies in the
office of the County Recorder of Deeds, and the filing of such statements in
the pertinent office shall be deemed notice for the payment of such charges for
such service. The City Clerk may, in lieu of filing a lien upon the property,
refer the delinquent bill to the City Attorney for the purpose of filing a
claim in small claims court for the collection of said delinquent bill.
   (G)   Unexpectedly high billing. A water customer, upon receipt of a water
billing that reflects water usage of three times the normal anticipated usage,
of which there is no explanation for the same, may petition the City Manager
for relief based upon the following factors:
      (1)   High billing defined. An unexpected billing that is three times the
normal, expected usage, which is not reflective of deliberate and excessive
usage, and which is further verified to be three times normally anticipated
usage by checking the average usage of the customer for the past 12 months, as
well as for the same time frame over the past 24 months. If such history is
unavailable for the customer at this particular site, then information from
past usage by that customer at another location may be utilized. However, the
lack of history shall not automatically nullify the customer from seeking
relief.
      (2)   Petition for relief. The customer responsible for the bill found to
meet the definition of a high water bill provided above, may file a petition
for relief at the office of the City Clerk, on forms provided by the Clerk,
which provides, at a minimum, the following information:
         (a)   Describe the use of the property;
         (b)   Was the water used, or was there a known plumbing problem;
         (c)   Attest that the water was not used, in any way, by the customer
or other potential users;
         (d)   Have, or will, allow the city to enter the property for the
purposes of conducting a complete and satisfactory inspection of the plumbing
and fixtures and other appurtenances of the property that might contribute to
the unexpected usage;
         (e)   Attest that, if problems with plumbing contributed to the
unexpected usage, they have had the same repaired, and acknowledge their
understanding that the city may limit the number of opportunities for relief;
         (f)   Pay $25 administrative fee.
      (3)   Actions by city. The city shall ensure that the following checks
have been made:
         (a)   A complete, thorough and satisfactory inspection of the property
was made by staff;
         (b)   A complete leak check was performed;
         (c)   Flow tests performed on the meter(s);
         (d)   Install, per existing policy, a replacement meter if found
appropriate;
         (e)   Provide historical information on customer usage.
      (4)   Relief to be provided. If all conditions of this subsection have
been met, then the City Manager shall adjust the billing as follows:
         (a)   No adjustment for sanitation collection;
         (b)   Adjust the billing for the water and sanitary sewer to a level
consistent with the historic use of the customer;
         (c)   Collect the administrative fee and complete payment of the bill.
      (5)   Limitations of relief. The city understands that unknown problems
may occur that could periodically contribute to the occurrence of an
unexpectedly high water billing; however, the city expects that precautions
will be taken by users to protect and maintain plumbing which is free from
defect and not prone to failure, e.g., fixing leaking stools, dripping/running
faucets, protect exposed piping from freezing. If a customer who has previously
sought relief is to ever again seek relief, that customer shall be held to the
highest burden of proof that they in no way contributed to the conditions that
resulted in such a high bill. Further, if the customer is a renter, and the
landlord is found to have failed to provide plumbing that is free of defect
and/or free of the potential for failure, specifically when told previously by
the city of what defects may exist, then no relief will be provided, and the
city may cease water service until such time that the plumbing defects are
addressed to the satisfaction of the city.
      (6)   Length of relief. The city understands that the unexpected usage
may occur over two billing cycles. Residents should contact the city as soon as
they are made aware of the high usage to begin the relief process. If all steps
are completed and the water bill is approved for relief by the City Manager,
the second cycle's bill will be automatically adjusted by the utility billing
clerk for the duration of the unexpected usage. Failure to seek relief on the
first bill may disqualify a resident from obtaining relief on subsequent high
bills due to the same issue.
   (I)   Water lien; petition for relief. A property owner who has had a water
lien recorded against his property by the city for nonpayment of water service
charges may petition the City Manager for relief pursuant to the following
rules, factors and regulations.
      (1)   Petition for relief. The owner of the property upon which the water
lien was recorded may file a petition for relief at the Office of the City
Clerk, on forms provided by the City Clerk, which provides, at a minimum, the
following information:
         (a)   The name, address and telephone number of the property owner.
         (b)   The address, legal description and tax parcel number of the
property upon which a city water lien was recorded.
         (c)   The date recorded and recording number of the city water lien.
         (d)   The outstanding amount of the water bill, the nonpayment of
which caused the recording of the water lien.
         (e)   The name, address and telephone number of the water service
customer, whose nonpayment resulted in the filing of a city water lien.
         (f)   The reasons why relief from the city water lien is requested and
should be granted.
         (g)   The signature of the applicant seeking relief.
         (h)   Payment of a $25 non-refundable filing fee.
      (2)   City action.
         (a)   Upon his or her receipt of the petition for relief, the City
Manager shall review all information regarding the city water lien, and at his
or her discretion, shall grant the petition for relief if the applicant has met
one of the following factors:
            1.   According to the Illinois Compiled Statutes, the statute of
limitations to foreclose on the water lien has expired.
            2.    A civil judgment has been rendered against the water customer
or property owner in favor of the city for collection of the unpaid water bill
charges, acting as a statutory release of the water lien.
            3.   Maintaining and foreclosing on the water lien will result in a
particular hardship to the applicant. Such hardship must be demonstrated to be
unique to that individual and not generally applicable to other water service
customers;
            4.   Maintaining and foreclosing on the water lien would result in
a negative impact on the community.
         (b)   If at his or her discretion none of the above factors apply, the
City Manager shall deny the petition for relief. A written notification of the
decision shall be provided to the applicant of the petition for relief.
         (c)   If the petition is granted, the City Manager shall direct the
City Attorney, or such other city employee as the City Manager may elect, to
record a release of lien with the Henry County Recorder’s Office.
            1.   The applicant of the petition for relief shall bear the full
costs of recording the release of lien with the Henry County Recorder’s Office.
            2.   The release of lien shall not be recorded until such time as
the City Clerk receives such recordation costs from the applicant.

§ 52.23 DISCONTINUANCE OF USE; NOTIFICATION; FEE FOR TURNING ON SUPPLY.
   Users desiring to discontinue the use of water shall notify the city in
writing. Failure to do so will result in that user retaining the responsibility
to pay for the water, sewer, and solid waste usage. In every case where the
water is shut off pursuant to notice or for cause, it shall not be turned on
again except by a city employee and only after a reconnection fee is paid by
the consumer for such service, together with all service charges, penalties,
and fees that are due.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)
§ 52.24 TENANT AND OWNERS.
   So the city can obtain a final meter reading for prior tenants and starting
meter readings for new tenants, the owner is obligated to give the city a
minimum of a two working day written notice before a new tenant occupies the
premises. The owner also is obligated to inform the city the date when a tenant
in whose name the service is billed will vacate a premises. The city is not
responsible to keep track of tenants who may “skip-out” on an owner. In the
case where water service has been shut off due to nonpayment of service, the
water service will not be turned on until the past-due bills for water, sewer,
and solid waste, penalties, red tag fee, the current bill, and the reconnection
fee are paid by either the tenant or the owner.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)
§ 52.25 AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE WATER SERVICE.
   The City Manager or person designated by him is authorized to terminate or
refuse to commence water service to a user at one location for the failure of
the user to pay for water, sewer and solid waste charges for services provided
to such user at a previous location.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)
ADMINISTRATION
§ 52.30 COLLECTION OF MONEYS.
   It is hereby made the duty of the City Clerk to render water bills for
service and for all rates and charges in connection therewith and to collect
all moneys due thereon. All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of
the waterworks, sewerage system, and solid waste charges shall be held by the
Clerk separate and apart from private funds and separate and apart from all
other funds of the city, and all of said sums, without any deduction whatever,
shall be delivered to the City Treasurer not more than ten days after receipt
of the same, or at such more frequent intervals as may from time to time be
directed by the City Manager.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)
§ 52.31 RECEIPT OF REVENUE; DEPOSIT; ACCOUNTS TO BE KEPT.
   The City Treasurer shall receive all such revenues from the waterworks,
sewerage system, and solid waste charges and all other funds and moneys
incident to the operation of such systems as the same may be delivered to him,
and deposit the same in a separate fund designated as the Water Fund, the Sewer
Fund, and the Sanitation Fund, and the Treasurer shall administer such funds in
every respect in the same manner provided by the provisions of the Illinois
Municipal Code. Said City Treasurer shall establish a proper system of accounts
and shall keep proper books, records and accounts in which complete and current
entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the waterworks, sewerage,
and solid waste systems, and at regular annual intervals. The City Manager
shall cause to be made an audit by an independent auditing concern of the books
to show the receipts and disbursements of the waterworks, sewerage, and solid
waste systems.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)
§ 52.32 COLLECTION AGENTS.
   The City Manager may designate additional collection agents which shall be
financial institutions located within the city for the purpose of collecting
any rates and charges for water services rendered by the city. No sum shall be
paid to any such collection agent designated by the City Manager for the
services rendered in collecting said rates and charges for water services
rendered by the city.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)

VIOLATION AND PENALTY
§ 52.40 ILLEGAL RESTORATION OF WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   If for any valid reason water is shut off to a premises by a person
authorized by the city and water service is restored to that premises by a
person not authorized by this code, the restoration of the water service shall
be considered to be an illegal act.
   (B)   After water service to a premises has been shut off per the notice
given by the red tag and then water is illegally restored, the occupant of the
premises or the user of the service are required to notify the city that water
service has been illegally restored. Failure on the part of the occupant of the
premises or the user of the service to so inform the city within 24 hours will
make them a party to the illegal reconnection and in violation of this code.
When the city shuts off water for nonpayment, a water meter reading is taken at
the time of shut off. In this case a meter reading in excess of the meter
reading at the time of shut off shall be considered prima facie proof that
water has been used illegally within the premises.
   (C)   Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be fined in
a sum not to exceed $500 for any one offense. The minimum fine for any offense
of this section shall be $100 plus court costs.
(Ord. 2953, passed 1-10-95)
CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL
§ 52.75 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL; GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   All plumbing installed within the city shall be installed per the
Illinois Plumbing Code, 77 Ill. Adm. Code 890. If per the Illinois Plumbing
Code or in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water supply
system, the Superintendent of Water will give notice to the water customer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water customer shall, at his
own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner per
the Illinois Plumbing Code, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA),
and all applicable regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made of
such approved devices upon installation and as required by the Illinois
Plumbing Code, IEPA, and applicable regulations.
   (B)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the city may enter the supply or distribution system of said
municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Superintendent of Water and the IEPA.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Water to cause surveys
and investigations to be made of commercial, industrial, and other properties
served by the public water supply to determine whether actual or potential
hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations
shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated at least every
two years, or as often as the Superintendent of Water shall deem necessary.
Records of such surveys shall be maintained and available for review for a
period of at least five years.
   (D)   The approved cross-connection control device inspector shall have the
right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to
the public water supply or distribution system of the city for the purpose of
verifying the presence or absence of cross-connections, and that the Water
Superintendent or his authorized agent shall have the right to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the city for the purpose of verifying information
submitted by the customer regarding the required cross-connection control
inspection. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served
shall furnish to the Superintendent of Water any information which he may
request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property.
The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of
the Superintendent of Water, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper
connections as provided in this subchapter.
   (E)   The Superintendent of Water of the city is authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
subchapter is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as
he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public
water supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this ordinance, and until a reconnection fee of $40 is
paid to the city. Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected
when the Superintendent of Water is assured that imminent danger of harmful
contamination of the public water supply system exists. Such action shall be
followed by written notification of the cause of disconnection. Immediate
disconnection without notice to any party can be effected to prevent actual or
anticipated contamination or pollution of the public water supply, provided
that, in the reasonable opinion of the Superintendent of Water or the IEPA,
such action is required to prevent actual or potential contamination or
pollution of the public water supply. Neither the public water supply, the
Superintendent of Water, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to any
customer for any injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from
termination of said customer's water supply per the terms of this subchapter,
whether or not said termination was with or without notice.
   (F)   The consumer responsible for backsiphoned or back pressured material
or contamination through backflow, if contamination of the potable water supply
system occurs through an illegal cross-connection or an improperly installed,
maintained or repaired device, or a device which has been bypassed, must bear
the cost of clean-up of the potable water supply system.
(Ord. 2840, passed 7-26-93)
§ 52.76 GENERAL POLICY.
   (A)   Purposes. The purposes of these rules and regulations are:
      (1)   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer's potable water systems.
   (B)   Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the city.
   (C)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or backsiphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water or his
authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary
for the safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent of Water
shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention
device at each service connection to the premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such approved device or devices at his own expense;
failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install such
device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water
service to the premises until such device or devices have been installed. The
consumer shall retain records of installation, maintenance, testing and repair
as required by this subchapter for a period of at least five years. The
Superintendent of Water may require the consumer to submit a cross-connection
inspection report to the city to assist in determining whether or not service
line protection will be required. All cross-connection inspections shall be
conducted by a Cross-Connection Control Device Inspector certified by the IEPA.

proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given
the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   "Don't Walk" or upraised palm signal. No pedestrian shall start to

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
§ 71.001 SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this city at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
divisions (C) and (D) below, by §
71.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in §
70.01) for all vehicles is:
      (1)   Thirty miles per hour; and
      (2)   Ten miles per hour in an alley.
   (D)   Unless some lesser speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit in a non-urban district is 55 miles per hour.
   (E)   A fine for this section shall be set forth as provided in Illinois
Supreme Court Rule 528.

motorized traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess
of 20 miles per hour while passing a school zone or while traveling on a local,
county, or state roadway on public school property or upon any public
thoroughfare where children pass going to and from school.
      (3)   For the purpose of this division (A), a school day begins at 6:30

incorporated town wherein the school zone is located. With regard to the
special speed limit while passing schools, such signs shall give proper due
warning that a school zone is being approached and shall indicate the school
zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when school
children are present.
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special school speed zone
indicating such zone, as defined in this division (A), nor shall evidence
obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the
use of such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in
such special school speed zone.
      (6)   Except as provided in division (A)(7) of this section, a person who

workers are not present.
      (3)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a construction or maintenance
speed zone indicating the zone, as defined in this division (B), nor shall
evidence obtained by use of those devices be inadmissible in any prosecution
for speeding, provided the use of the device shall apply only to the
enforcement of the speed limit in the construction or maintenance speed zone.
      (4)   As used in this division (B), a CONSTRUCTION OR MAINTENANCE SPEED
ZONE is an area in which the Department, Toll Highway Authority, or local
agency has posted signage advising drivers that a construction or maintenance
speed zone is being approached, or in which the Department, Authority, or local
agency has posted a lower speed limit with a highway construction or
maintenance speed zone special speed limit sign after determining that the
preexisting established speed limit through a highway construction or
maintenance project is greater than is reasonable or safe with respect to the
conditions expected to exist in the construction or maintenance speed zone.
         (a)   If it is determined that the preexisting established speed limit
is safe with respect to the conditions expected to exist in the construction or
maintenance speed zone, additional speed limit signs which conform to the
requirements of this division (B)(4) shall be posted.
         (b)   Highway construction or maintenance speed zone special speed
limit signs shall be of a design approved by the Department. The signs must
give proper due warning that a construction or maintenance speed zone is being
approached and must indicate the maximum speed limit in effect. The signs also
must state the amount of the minimum fine for a violation.

is:
         (a)   Twenty-six miles per hour or more but less than 35 miles per
hour in excess of the applicable special speed limit established under this
division (B) or a similar provision of a local ordinance and is guilty of a
Class B misdemeanor; or
         (b)   Thirty-five miles per hour or more in excess of the applicable
special speed limit established under this division (B) or a similar provision
of a local ordinance and is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
      (7)   The Illinois State Police and the local county police department
have concurrent jurisdiction over any violation of this division (B) that

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.080 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train or railroad track
equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate
hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
   (A-1)   Whenever any person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined
in 625 ILCS 5/6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is
not always required to stop, the person must exercise due care and caution as
the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and
under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop
within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad
and shall not proceed until the tracks are clear and he or she can do so
safely. The foregoing requirements shall apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train or railroad track
equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate
hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
   (A-5)   Whenever a person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in
625 ILCS 5/6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not
always required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care
and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning
of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the
driver shall slow down within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the
nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she checks that
the tracks are clear of an approaching train or railroad track equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while such gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   The Department, and local authorities with the approval of the
Department, are hereby authorized to designate particularly dangerous highway
grade crossings of railroads and to erect stop signs thereat. When such stop
signs are erected the driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not
less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of such railroad and shall proceed only
upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.
   (D-1)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.
   (E)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.

$500 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $1,000 shall be
imposed for a second or subsequent violation. The court may impose 25 hours of

to a charge under this section that either the sign posted pursuant to this
section or the intended accessible parking place does not comply with the
technical requirements of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-301, Department
regulations, or local ordinance if a reasonable person would be made aware by
the sign or notice on or near the parking space that the place is reserved for
a person with disabilities.

(2) a first time shall be fined $600. Any person found guilty of violating
division (A)(2) a second or subsequent time shall be fined $1,000. Any person
who violates division (A)(3) is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and shall be
fined $2,500. The Circuit Clerk shall distribute 50% of the fine imposed on any
person who is found guilty of or pleads guilty to violating this section, to
the law enforcement agency that issued the citation or made the arrest. If more
than one law enforcement agency is responsible for issuing the citation or
making the arrest, the 50% of the fine imposed shall be shared equally. If an

scooter shall operate the vehicle as near to the right-hand side of the roadway
as is safe and practicable. Where a paved shoulder is available and safe for
travel, operators may use the shoulder. This provision does not require
operators to ride in an unsafe manner when avoiding hazards, turning left, or
when the lane is too narrow to share safely with other vehicles.
   (T)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt any operator of a
gas-powered scooter from compliance with applicable state laws regarding
vehicle registration, titling, insurance, or licensing. Any scooter that meets

performance of the work to be done and materials to be used to complete the
work specified in the ordinance locating such sidewalk. All sidewalks built
within the city shall comply in all respects with the following specifications:
   (B)   Specifications.
   Thickness. The sidewalk slab shall be four inches thick in residential
districts and six inches thick in the business districts.
   Width. The width of all permanent sidewalks shall be established by the
ordinance locating the same.
   Grade. All sidewalks shall be laid, constructed and built so as to conform
in all respects when completed to the grades heretofore established by the
provisions of this code, or which may be established by the ordinance locating
the said sidewalk.
   Subgrade. The subgrade shall be evenly tamped or rolled until thoroughly
compacted and as near as practicable have uniform density throughout. The
subgrade shall be brought to the lines, grade and cross- section as shown on
plans and which are made a part of the ordinance locating said sidewalk. All
soft and unstable material which will not compact readily shall be removed as
directed and replaced with suitable material. Wherever filling is required it
shall be made with suitable material and compacted thoroughly by rolling or
tamping. Fills exceeding 12 inches in depth shall be settled and compacted in a
manner suitable to the City Engineer.
   Forms. Side forms shall be of lumber, 1¾-inches thick or of steel of equal
rigidity. They shall be set with exactness to the required grade and alignment
and held securely in place by stakes or braces. The forms for the sidewalks
shall be so set that the slab will have a fall of one-inch vertical to four-
feet horizontal from the edge nearest the property line toward the edge
farthest from the property line. After the forms are set the subgrade shall be
tested with an approved template to insure the specified cross- section.
   Mixing. The concrete shall be mixed only in the quantity required for
immediate use. Concrete which has been mixed longer than 30 minutes, or which
has developed initial set shall not be used. Retempering concrete by adding
water or by other means will not be permitted. No materials containing frost or
lumps of hardened materials shall be used.
   The aggregates and the cement shall be thoroughly mixed in an approved batch
mixer for a period of not less than one minute. The water shall be introduced
in a uniform manner during the first 15 seconds of the mixing period. The
mixing time may be extended if necessary to obtain thorough mixing and uniform
consistency. Any concrete mixed less than the specified mixing time shall be
rejected and shall be disposed of by the contractor at his expense. The entire
contents of the drum shall be discharged before any materials are placed
therein for the succeeding batch. The volume of material mixed per batch shall
not exceed the manufacturer's rated capacity of the drum in cubic feet of mixed
concrete. The batches shall be so designed that they will not require
fractional bags of cement.
   Hand mixing will not be permitted except in case of emergency and then only
with the written permission of the Engineer.
   Consistency of Concrete. The mixture shall contain no more water than is
necessary to produce a concrete which is workable and plastic and shall have a
slump of not less than two inches nor more than six inches.
   Placing and Finishing. The subgrade shall be adequately moistened just
before the concrete is placed. The concrete shall be placed in successive
batches for the entire width of the slab, struck off from ½-inch to ¾-inch
higher than the finished slab, tamped until all voids are removed and free
mortar appears on the surface, thoroughly spaded along the edges, struck off to
a true grade, and finished to a true and even surface with suitable trowels and
floats. Use of metal trowels will be prohibited. The surface shall be divided
into rectangular slabs with division plates which shall be removed after the
concrete has hardened sufficiently to avoid breaking the edges of the slab. The
length of each slab shall be the same as the width of the sidewalk established
by the ordinance locating said sidewalk. The edges of the slabs shall be edged
with an edging tool rounded to a radius of ¼-inch. The operations of
depositing, com pacting and spading shall be conducted so that the concrete,
after the removal of the forms, will be free from aggregate pockets and honey
comb. All exposed surfaces shall be uniformly smooth, dense and free from
projections. All unexposed surfaces shall be dense and free from excessive
depressions or projections. All concrete which does not meet these requirements
shall be removed and replaced by the contractor, or shall be repaired as
directed by the Engineer.
   Expansion Joints. Expansion joints one-inch thick shall be placed at
intervals of one 100 feet in the sidewalk, and between driveway pavement and
sidewalk. Expansion joints ½-inch thick shall be provided between the sidewalk
and all structures such as light standards, traffic light standards, trolley
poles and manholes, which extend through the sidewalks. Expansion joints shall
consist of bituminous premolded expansion joints consisting of bitumen, felt
and mineral. It shall be of such character that it will not be deformed by
ordinary handling during hot weather, nor become brittle in cold weather. It
shall be of the dimensions shown on the plans which are made a part of the
ordinance locating said sidewalk.
   Curing. As soon as the pavement has been finished as specified herein, it
shall be protected against rapid drying by covering with burlap, laid directly
upon the surface as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent
marring the surface. The burlap covering shall be applied wet and shall be kept
wet until removed by applying water in the form of a spray. In no case shall a
solid stream of water be directed on the burlap. Not earlier than 24 hours
after the concrete is placed, the burlap covering shall be removed and the
sidewalk cured by a method suitable to the Engineer.
   Placing Concrete in Cold Weather. Concrete may be mixed or placed when the
air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat is 40° F., and
falling only with the written permission of the Engineer. Necessary precautions
shall be taken to protect the work from freezing. In no case shall concrete be
deposited upon a frozen subgrade.
   Subdrains. In case of subgrades which are continually wet, and which, in the
opinion of the Engineer do not insure a well-drained foundation, a line of tile
shall be laid parallel to the walk on the uphill side to intercept the seepage.
In cases where tiling is impracticable or impossible, and when special
preparation for drainage is necessary the subgrade shall consist of a four-inch
foundation of cinders, gravel or similar material.
   Upon all questions concerning the execution of the work, concerning the
interpretation of these specifications and concerning the measurement and
classification of the work, the decision of the City Engineer shall be final
and binding.
   Composition of Concrete. The proportions of cement, fine aggregate, course
aggregate and water will be determined by the Engineer, before the work begins
so as to produce a workable plastic concrete having a compressive strength of
not less than 3,500 pounds per square inch, and a modules of rupture of not
less than 650 pounds per square inch at the age of 14 days when tested by
standard methods. This determination will be based upon the tests of the
aggregates selected by the contractor for use in the work. The quantities of
aggregates for each batch of concrete shall be measured by weight.
   The Engineer reserves the right to determine as the work progresses, the
proportions of cement, water and the aggregates actually furnished which will
produce workable plastic concrete having the strength specified herein.
   The Engineer may, at his discretion, permit the contractor to proportion the
aggregates for the concrete for a limited extent of sidewalk by volume. In
proportioning by volume the unit of measurement shall be one cubic foot. One
sack of cement (94 pounds) shall be considered as equal to one cubic foot.
Aggregates shall be measured separately by volume, using measuring devices
approved by the Engineer. The volume of fine or course aggregate shall be based
upon dry loose materials.
   Cement. All cement used shall be American Portland Cement conforming to the
requirements of the “Standard Specifications for Portland Cement, A.S.T.M.

city before any court of competent jurisdiction, either by suit upon his bond
or otherwise.

section of the work forfeited, it is expressly stipulated and understood that

shall remain valid and binding on said contractor.
   In case the contractor abandons or in any manner fails to complete the work
within the time herein specified, the city is authorized and empowered to pay
any laborer who has been employed by the contractor upon the said work, the
amount due such laborer out of any funds due the contractor or its intention to
do so. In every such case, the City Clerk of the city is authorized and
empowered to ascertain in such a manner and upon such proofs as he may deem

thereafter be paid over to such laborer by the city.

§ 122.01 ROOFING CONTRACTORS.
   (A)   The Illinois Roofing Industry Licensing Act (ILCS Ch. 225, Act 335) is
adopted by reference.
   (B)   Permit. The City Clerk shall issue a permit to any person acting as a
roofing contractor within the City of Kewanee. The form of the permit shall be
determined by the City Manager and at a minimum shall contain the roofing
contractor's name, address, telephone number, State of Illinois Certified
roofing license number, the date of issue, and the fee paid.
   (C)   Qualification. Per ILCS Ch. 225, Act 335, § 11(7) the only
qualification that is required by the City Clerk prior to issuing a permit is
the exhibition of current evidence of a State of Illinois roofing license.

City of Kewanee permit fee will be due biennially. If an applicant for an
initial permit applies for the permit during the second half of the biennial
period, the applicant shall only be required to pay one-half of the amount for

property, or for no consideration, to obtain a permit as a roofing contractor.
This applies to city employees who are conducting roofing work as city
employees on city property.
   (F)   Penalty. Any person, or firm, who performs any roofing work contrary
to the provisions of this section; or any person or firm, who performs any
roofing work without first obtaining a license from the State of Illinois as

   (A)   Short title. This section may be known and cited as the "City of
Kewanee Disturbing the Peace and Noise Control Ordinance."
   (B)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   The Kewanee City Council finds that unreasonably excessive noise
degrades the environment of the city to a degree that such noise:
         (a)   Is harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of city residents
and visitors;
         (b)   Interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property;
         (c)   Interferes with the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of
one's home; and
         (d)   Can cause and aggravate health problems.
      (2)   The effective control of unreasonably excessive noise is essential
to the health, safety, and welfare of city residents and visitors, and fosters
the comfortable enjoyment of life, including, but not limited to, recreation,
work, communication, and rest.
      (3)   This section is enacted to protect, preserve, and promote the
health, safety, welfare, peace, and quiet of residents and visitors of the city
through the control, reduction, and prevention of unreasonably excessive noises
that unreasonably disturb, injure, or endanger the comfort, repose, health,
peace, or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary sensitivities.
      (4)   Nothing contained in this section is intended to infringe upon the
constitutionally protected rights guaranteed by the Illinois Constitution and
the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. This section enacts
narrowly drawn, content-neutral regulations that are to be interpreted so as to
not unduly restrict constitutionally protected rights.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning:
      AMPLIFIED SOUND. Sound whose volume is increased by any electric,
electronic, mechanical, or motor-powered means.
      A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL. The sound pressure level in decibels as measured
with a sound level meter using the A-weighting network as described in ANSI
S1.4-1983 issued by the American National Standards Institute. The unit of
measurement is the dBA.
      C-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL. The sound pressure level in decibels as measured
with a sound level meter using the C-weighting network as described in ANSI
S1.4-1983 issued by the American National Standards Institute. The unit of
measurement is the dBC.
      DECIBEL (dB). A unit for measuring the amplitude of sound, equal to 20
times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound
measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons
per square meter).
      EMERGENCY. Any occurrence, or set of circumstances, involving actual,
threatened, or imminent physical trauma or injury, natural resource damage, or
property damage which demands immediate action.
      Leq (EQUIVALENT SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL). The constant sound level that, in
a given situation and time period, conveys the same sound energy as the actual
time-varying sound.
      OFFICER. Any designated employee or agent of the city whose duty it is to
enforce codes and ordinances enacted by the city and may include, but shall not
be limited to, law enforcement officers and code enforcement officers.

equipment, or any combination of such, jointly and severally.
      PLAINLY AUDIBLE. Any sound that can be clearly heard by a reasonable
person using such person's ordinary auditory senses, so long as the person's
hearing is not enhanced by any device, such as a hearing aid. The person need
not determine the particular words or phrases being produced or the name of any
song or artist producing the sound for the sound to be considered plainly
audible. The detection of a rhythmic bass reverberating type sound is
sufficient to constitute a plainly audible sound.

and includes the air space above.
      PROPERTY LINE. Either (i) an imaginary line along the ground surface, and
its vertical plane extension, which separates the real property owned, rented,

standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL
§ 154.025 PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Prior to the submission of the preliminary plat, a pre-filing
conference shall be held between the developer and the appropriate city staff.
The developer shall present a concept sketch of the proposed development. City
staff shall use a standardized checklist to review the proposed development for
conformance to this chapter.
   (B)   Previous to the filing of an application for conditional approval of
the preliminary plat (general or preliminary subdivision plan), the subdivider
may submit to the Plan Commission, plans and data as specified in §§ 154.40
through 154.42. This step does not require formal application fee or filing of
plat with the Plan Commission.
   (C)   Within 30 days the Plan Commission shall inform the subdivider that
the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not meet the objectives
of these regulations. When the Plan Commission finds the plans and data do not
meet the objectives of these regulations it shall express its reasons therefor.
   (D)   Land subject to flooding or poor drainage. No plat will be approved
for a subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains poor
drainage facilities and which would make adequate drainage of the lots and
streets impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements
which will, in the opinion of the City Engineer, make the area completely safe
for residential occupancy and provide adequate lot and street drainage, the
preliminary plat of the subdivision may be approved.

00)
§ 154.026 PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in § 154.25,
regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall cause to be
prepared a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans and other
supplementary material as specified in §§ 154.40 through 154.42.
   (B)   Twelve copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material
specified shall be submitted to the Plan Commission with written application
for conditional approval at least 15 days prior to the meeting at which it is
to be considered.
   (C)   At the time of filing an application for conditional approval of the
preliminary plat, the application shall be accompanied by a certified check or
money order payable to the city in the amount of $100, plus $40 for each lot in
excess of two lots in the proposed subdivision to cover the cost of checking
and verifying the proposed plat. Upon the acceptance of the application by the
Plan Commission, the Secretary shall surrender the check or money order to the
City Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund of the city. The Plan Commission
Secretary shall cause a public notice to be published in the local newspaper
advising the public of the pending hearing to review the proposed plat. Said
public notice shall be published at least ten days prior to the hearing. The
Plan Commission Secretary shall cause a direct mailing notice to be sent to all
owners of property within 300 feet of the boundary of the land proposed to be
subdivided. Said direct mailing notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior
to the hearing.
   (D)   Following review of the preliminary plat and other material submitted
for conformity thereof to these regulations and negotiations with the
subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements
to be made by him, the Plan Commission shall, within 30 days, act thereon as
submitted or modified, and if approved, the Plan Commission shall express its
approval as conditional approval and state the conditions of such approval, if
any or if disapproved, shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor.
   (E)   The action of the Plan Commission shall be noted on two copies of the
preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the Plan
Commission.
   (F)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval
to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation
of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the Plan Commission
and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and
the conditions of the conditional approval, if any.

said improvements.
      (2)   The City Council shall not act upon the application for final plat
approval.
   (B)   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposed to record and
develop at the time; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all
requirements of these regulations.
   (C)   Application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted in
writing to the Plan Commission at least 21 days prior to the meeting at which
it is to be considered. The Plan Commission Secretary shall cause a public
notice to be published in the local newspaper advising the public of the
pending hearing to review the proposed plat. Said public notice shall be
published at least ten days prior to the hearing. The Plan Commission Secretary
shall cause a direct mailing notice to be sent to all owners of property within
300 feet of the boundary of the land proposed to be subdivided. Said direct
mailing notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing.
   (D)   Twelve copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for
approval shall be prepared as specified in §§ 154.40 through 154.42, and shall
be submitted to the Plan Commission within six months after approval of the
preliminary plat; unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the
Plan Commission.
   (E)   The final plat submitted to the Plan Commission for approval shall be
accompanied by a notice from the City Manager stating that there has been filed

installations to the subdivision required for its approval have been made or
installed in accordance with the specifications; or
      (2)   Legal assurance to guarantee completion of the improvements in a

154.051.
      (3)   Within 30 days after application for approval of the final plat,
the Plan Commission shall approve or disapprove it. If the Plan Commission
approves, it shall affix its seal upon the plat together with the certifying
signature of its Chairperson and Secretary. If it disapproves, it shall set
forth its reasons in its own records and provide the applicant with a copy.
   (F)   After approval of the final plat by the Plan Commission and the
fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations, six original copies of
the final plat of the subdivision, two of which are executed on Mylar, shall be
submitted to the Council for approval.
      (1)   Action must be taken by the Council within 30 days after the final
plat has been submitted for approval.
      (2)   Upon approval of the Council, the developer shall record the plat
with the Recorder or Registrar of Titles within four months. If not recorded
within this time, the approval shall be null and void. Immediately after
recording, the original or a duly certified copy shall be filed with the City
Clerk.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 154.055 STREETS.
   (A)   The subdivision of land, including the arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade and location of all expressways, streets, alleys, crosswalks,
easements, sites for parks, playgrounds and schools, or other land to be
dedicated for public use, shall conform to the General Development Plan of the
city as approved by the Plan Commission and adopted by the City Council and
other responsible governmental bodies of the city as a part of the Official
Plan of the city.
      (1)   All streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, in typographical conditions, to public convenience and safety,
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served
by such streets. When at all possible each subdivision shall have a minimum of
two separate entrances. Said entrances shall be remote located from one another
such as at opposite diagonal corners of the subdivision, or some similar
spacing.
      (2)   Where such is not shown in the General Development Plan, the
arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
         (a)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal streets, or
         (b)   Conform to a plan for the area or neighborhood approved or
adopted by the Plan Commission to meet a particular situation where
topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing
streets impracticable.
      (3)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
      (4)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
expressway or primary street, as shown on the General Development Plan, the
Plan Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non-access reservation, at least ten feet wide,
along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (5)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad or
expressway, the Plan Commission may require a street approximately parallel to
and on each side of such railroad or expressway, at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential
districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts.
Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations.
      (6)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets or alleys shall be
prohibited.
      (7)   All street intersections and confluences should encourage safe
traffic flow.
      (8)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
      (9)   Tangents shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets
(see Table of Minimum Standards in division (B) of this section).
      (10)    When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than 10°, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure clear sight distance (see Table of Minimum Standards in
division (B) of this section).
      (11)    Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less
than 60°.
      (12)    Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius as specified in the Table of Minimum Standards in division (B) of this
section. The Plan Commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place
of rounded corners.
      (13)    Street right of way widths shall be as shown in the General
Development Plan and where not shown therein shall be as specified in the Table
of Minimum Standards in division (B) of this section, or as recommended by the
Plan Commission.
      (14)    Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations; and where the Plan Commission finds it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. If
pavement is installed on a half street, a temporary vehicle turn around shall
be installed as necessary.
      (15)    Dead-end streets (cul-de-sac) designed to be so permanently shall
not be longer than 500 feet from the intersection of the origin through the
center of the circle to the end of the right-of-way, and shall be provided at
the closed end with a turn-around having an outside pavement diameter of at
least 80 feet, and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet.
      (16)    No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be continued
wherever possible. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Plan
Commission.
      (17)    Street gradients and vertical curves shall be as specified in the
Table of Minimum Standards in this chapter.
      (18)    Street grades shall provide proper relation between the street
and the first floor elevation of the houses or buildings and to permit
convenient and economical access to and drainage of the lots.
   (B)   Minimum standards for street design.

and shown on the development plans made a part thereof, is located in whole or
in part in an area being subdivided, the subdivider shall dedicate such lands
to the proper public agency or agencies as a part of the final subdivision
plat; however, in no case shall the amount of required public areas to be
dedicated, in addition to public streets and alleys, exceed 10% of the total
gross acreage owned or controlled by one developer. Where such area for park,
school or other public use exceeds 10% of the total gross area owned or
controlled by one developer, that part of such lands in excess of 10% of the
total gross area shall also be shown on all subdivision plans and plats; and
the acquisition of such additional area needed for parks, playgrounds, schools
or other public uses, other than streets and alleys, shall be secured by the
proper governing bodies, or arrangements made for the acquisition of the area
from the subdivider at the cost of unimproved land, within a period not to
exceed three years from the date of approval of the preliminary plan.

Comprehensive City Plan, the subdivider shall dedicate such area as required
and, in addition, pay to the proper governing body as determined by the Plan
Commission, a sum of money, so that either or both the dedication and the
payment equal 10% of the appraised value of the land before it is subdivided.
Sums so received by the proper governing body shall be placed in a special fund
and used by the governing body solely for purchase of land for parks, schools
and other public uses in accordance with the official Comprehensive City Plan,
and after receipt of the recommendations of the Plan Commission. The value of
the subject land shall be established by negotiation, and if negotiations fail,
by appraisal made by three qualified appraisers, one of whom shall be appointed
by the Plan Commission, one of whom shall be appointed by the subdivider, and
one of whom shall be mutually agreed upon by the two appraisers named above.

establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles per the use to which property is put.
('71 Code, § 11-18-1) (Ord. 1413, passed 9-13-60)
§ 155.121 PARKING AND LOADING SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Procedure. An application for a building permit for a new or enlarged
building, structure, or use shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale
and fully dimensioned showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided
in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Extent of control. The off-street parking and loading requirements of
this chapter shall apply as follows:
      (1)   All buildings and structures erected and land uses initiated after
the effective date of this chapter shall provide accessory off-street parking
or loading facilities as required hereinafter for the use thereof, except that
a building or structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to
the effective date of this chapter shall not be required to furnish parking or
loading facilities if construction is begun thereon within six months of the
effective date of this chapter and diligently prosecuted to completion.
      (2)   When a building or structure erected prior to or after the
effective date of this chapter shall undergo any decrease in number of dwelling
units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees or other unit of
measurement specified hereinafter for the required parking or loading
facilities, and further, when said decrease would result in a requirement for
fewer total parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of
this chapter thereto, parking and loading facilities may be reduced
accordingly, provided that existing parking or loading facilities shall be so
decreased only when the facilities remaining would at least equal or exceed the
parking or loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of
this chapter to the entire building or structure as modified.
      (3)   When a building or structure shall undergo any increase in the
number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other unit of
measurement specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities,
and further, when said increase would result in a requirement for additional
total parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of this
chapter thereto, parking and loading facilities may be increased accordingly,
provided that existing parking or loading facilities shall be so increased that
the facilities would at least equal or exceed the parking of loading
requirements resulting from application of the provisions of this chapter to
the entire building or structure as modified.
      (4)   (a)   When a building is erected in the Central Business District
and the compliance with the regulations and requirements for off-street
parking, as set forth in this subchapter would result impractical difficulties
or undue hardship, the applicant for a permit to erect or enlarge a building
may elect to contribute to the city $1,200 for each required parking space. All
such funds received shall be deposited with the city in a special fund to be
known as “Central Business District Special Off-Street Parking Fund” and shall
be used by the city to develop off-street parking facilities, within the area
described below, for the convenience, safety, and general welfare of the people

loading spaces in existence on the effective date hereof may not be reduced in
number unless already exceeding the requirements of this subchapter for
equivalent new construction; in which event said spaces shall not be reduced
below the number required herein for such equivalent new construction.
   (D)   Permissive parking and loading spaces. Nothing in this subchapter
shall prevent the establishment of off-street automobile parking or loading
facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, subject to full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, except that off-street
parking areas accessory to existing multiple-family structures cannot be
located off the premises containing the main use, unless on a lot adjacent
thereto, without authorization by the City Council.

existence and is a conforming use on the effective date hereof and which
subsequently shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or
other cause may be reconstructed, re-established or repaired with or without
off-street parking or loading facilities, except that parking or loading
facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However it shall not
be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of
those required by this chapter for equivalent new construction.
   (F)   Schedule of requirements.

SPECIAL USES
§ 155.155 PURPOSE.
   The principal objective of the zoning code is to provide for an orderly
arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses, and for the proper location
of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the city.
To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as
permitted in one or more of the various districts established by this chapter.
However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in
each district, there are certain additional uses which it may be necessary to
allow because of their unusual characteristics or the service they provide the
public. These special uses require particular consideration as to their proper
location in relation to adjacent established or intended uses, or to the
planned development of the community. The conditions controlling the location
and operation of such special uses are established by the following provisions
of this subchapter.
('71 Code, § 11-22-1) (Ord. 1413, passed 9-13-60)
§ 155.156 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   The City Plan Commission may recommend, and the City Council may impose,
such restrictions upon the height, bulk, and area of occupancy of any structure
so approved for special use as may be reasonable under the particular
circumstances, provided that such restrictions and stipulations shall not be
more restrictive than the requirements established for the district in which
such structure is proposed to be located, or as may be required in any
municipal code. Off-street parking facilities as well as off-street loading and
unloading spaces may also be stipulated in the order permitting to special use.
('71 Code, § 11-22-2) (Ord. 1413, passed 9-13-60)
§ 155.157 PROCEDURE IN CONSIDERING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL USES.
   The procedure to be followed in considering application for special uses
shall be as follows:
   (A)   Application. An application verified by the owner or authorized agent
of the owner of the property involved, shall be filed with the City Clerk for
the attention of the Plan Commission upon a form prescribed therefor, which
shall contain or be accompanied by all required information.
      (1)   Applicants for a special use permit shall file a written
application on a form supplied by the Building Official which shall be signed
by the property owner or his or her authorized representative and (if
different) the applicant, under penalty of perjury. If an authorized
representative is involved for the owner or applicant, the authorized
representative shall provide a notarized sworn affidavit from the owner or
applicant attesting to the authorized representative's standing. Said form
shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee which shall be set from time to
time by resolution of the City Council.
      (2)   Contents of application. The application shall at a minimum provide
the following information:
         (a)   The name(s) and mailing addresses of the property owner(s) and
proposed business operators;
         (b)   The property location, including assessor's parcel number, and
legal description of said property;
         (c)   The name and nature of the business and activities to be
conducted on the property;
         (d)   The proposed hours of operation, if applicable;
         (e)   A detailed site plan drawn to scale and dimensioned including:

   (B)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of such verified application, the Clerk
shall notify the Chairperson of the Plan Commission, or in his absence the Vice
Chairperson, who shall give notice of a public hearing in the same manner as
provided for hearings on the reclassification of property as contained in §
155.207. A record of pertinent information presented at the public hearing
shall be made and maintained by the Plan Commission as part of the permanent
record relative to the application.
   (C)   Determination. The Plan Commission shall then make its findings and
recommendations to the Council within 30 days following the date of public
hearing on each application. The Council may then authorize a special use as
defined herein by specific ordinance, provided the evidence presented is such
as to establish beyond reasonable doubt:
      (1)   That the proposed use at the particular location requested is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the
interest of public convenience, and will contribute to the general welfare of
the neighborhood or community;
      (2)   That such use will not, under the circumstances of the particular
case, be detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of
persons residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property values or
improvements in the vicinity, and
      (3)   That the proposed use will comply with the regulations and
conditions specified in this chapter for such use, and with the stipulations
and conditions made a part of the authorization granted by the Council.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
§ 155.170 CHARACTER OF DEVELOPMENTS; ADDITIONAL STANDARDS AND EXCEPTIONS
REQUIRED.
   Planned developments, as defined in §
155.003 are of such substantially different character from other special uses
that specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby set out to
govern the recommendations of the Plan Commission and the action of the
Council.
('71 Code, § 11-23-1) (Ord. 1413, passed 9-13-60)
§ 155.171 USE EXCEPTIONS.
   In the case of residential, business, or manufacturing planned developments,
the Plan Commission may recommend and the City Council may authorize that there
be in part of the area of such development and for the duration of such
development specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the district
in which said development is located, provided the Plan Commission shall find:
   (A)   That the uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;
   (B)   That the uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or
so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding
neighborhood;
   (C)   That not more than 20% of the ground area or of the gross floor area
of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by said exception;
and
   (D)   That in a manufacturing planned development, such additional uses
allowed by exception shall conform with the performance standards of the
district in which the development is located.

§ 155.172 BULK REGULATIONS.
   In case of any planned development, the Plan Commission may recommend and
the City Council may authorize exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of
this chapter within the boundaries of such development, provided that the Plan
Commission shall find:
   (A)   That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such
development as well as of neighboring properties than would obtain under the
bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed on separate zoning
lots;
   (B)   That the overall bulk of buildings of the development shall not exceed
that prescribed in this chapter for the district in which it is located;
   (C)   That the minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements of this
chapter shall be adhered to in any such development containing residential
uses, and that there shall be available to each residential building and
immediately adjacent thereto (including the land area upon which it is
erected), the minimum amount of land area required for such building under the
lot area per dwelling unit provisions of this chapter;
   (D)   That spacing between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent
to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly developed
under the terms of this chapter on separate zoning lots, due consideration
being given to the openness normally afforded by the intervening streets and
alleys; and
   (E)   That along the periphery of such planned developments, yards shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said
development is located.

CHAPTER 157: STORM WATER, SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL REGULATIONS
Section
   
157.001   Purpose
   
157.002   Definitions
   
157.003   Storm water regulations
   
157.004   Soil erosion and sedimentation control principles
   
157.005   Adherence to approved drainage plans; enforcement; appeal
 
   
157.999   Penalty
§ 157.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Storm water regulations. It is not the intent of this chapter to take
areas out of use for the sole purpose of storing excess storm water. Nor is it
the purpose of this chapter to restrict land use or increase development costs.
The basic purpose of this chapter is to eliminate the storage or transportation
of excess storm water in or through habitable structures. The use of "natural"
paths of storm water runoff to form the "by-pass" channel and the restriction
of this channel to form storage areas is encouraged. Since political and
ownership boundaries often make the use of "natural" drainage patterns
difficult, the earthmoving that is accomplished to create the maximum land
usage should also be planned to provide a "by-pass" channel for storm water
that will not create a diversion of storm water drainage or radically change
the watershed boundaries. The drainage scheme presented by those who wish to
develop property in the city should be planned to accomplish all of the storm
water controls of this chapter without major loss of land use.
   (B)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control. In regards to soil erosion and
sedimentation control, the purpose of this chapter is to protect the public
health, safety and welfare of the people of the city and the environment in
which they live by guiding, regulating and controlling the design,
construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which
disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on
land, or removes natural or cultivated vegetation, and which thereby creates
the increased possibility of soil erosion, sediment deposits or flooding.

§ 157.003 STORM WATER REGULATIONS.
   Drainage schemes for control of storm water shall comply with the following
regulations.
   (A)   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff shall
be required in combination for all developments except single-family
residential developments that contain an area less than one acre.
   (B)   The controlled release rate of storm water runoff from all
developments described in subsection (A), hereof, shall not exceed the existing
"safe" storm drainage capacity of the natural downstream outlet channel or
storm sewer system. The rate at which storm water runoff is delivered to a
designated storm water storage area shall be unrestricted.
   (C)   Storm water channels.
      (1)   A "natural" or surface channel system shall be designed with
adequate capacity to convey through the development the storm water runoff from
all tributary upstream areas. This "by-pass" channel shall be designed to carry
the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year frequency rain event, assuming all
storm sewers are blocked and that the upstream areas are fully developed and
have been saturated with antecedent rainfall. No habitable structures shall be
constructed within this floodway, however, streets and parking or playground
areas and utility easements shall be considered compatible uses.
      (2)   Design of this floodway system shall also take into consideration
control of storm water velocity to prevent erosion or other damage to the
facility which will restrict its primary use. Depths of flow shall be kept to a
minimum and retention of channel configurations shall be totally under
Municipal control. In the event that the area within this "by-pass" channel is
reshaped or restricted for use as a floodway, the Municipality will cause to
have any restrictions removed at the expense of the party or parties causing
said restriction.
      (3)   Should the development contain an existing "natural" waterway, this
land configuration shall be preserved as part of the "by-pass" channel system.
Construction of a "low flow" system of storm sewers to carry the minor storm
runoff and reshaping of the channel with a maximum of six horizontal to one
vertical (6:1) side slopes and bottom of a width adequate to facilitate
maintenance and carry the flood runoff without eroding velocities shall be
included in the plans for land development.
   (D)   The required volume for storm water detention shall be calculated on
the basis of the runoff from a 25-year frequency rain event of any duration as
published by a recognized agency. This volume of storage shall be provided for
the fully developed watershed that is tributary to the area designated for
detention purposes. The storm water release rate shall be considered when
calculating the storm water storage capacity and the control structure designed
to maintain a relatively uniform flow rate regardless of the depth of storm
water in the storage area.
   (E)   Dry bottom storm water storage areas.
      (1)   Dry bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will
not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. A method of
carrying the low flow through these areas shall be provided in addition to a
system of drains, and both shall be provided with a positive gravity outlet to
a natural channel or storm sewer with adequate capacity as described in §
157.002 hereof.
      (2)   The combination of storage of water from a 25-year storm and the
design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 72
hours. Maximum depth of planned storm water storage shall not exceed four feet
unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to
greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the municipality. Minimum
grades for turf areas shall be 2% and maximum slopes shall be 10% (ten units
horizontally to one unit vertically). Storage area side slopes shall be kept as
close to the natural land contours as practical and a 10% slope or less shall
be used wherever possible. If slopes greater than 10% are necessary to meet
storage requirements or area restrictions, approval shall be obtained from the
Municipality and suitable erosion control provided in addition to the
protection required to insure public health, safety and welfare.
      (3)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible
and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Outlet control
structures shall also be designed in consideration of the safety of adjacent
persons and property. When necessary, said structures will have features to
restrict access to unwanted parties. Each storm water storage area shall be
provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event that a storm in
excess of the 25-year frequency storm occurs. This emergency overflow facility
shall be designed to function without attention and shall become part of the
"natural" or surface channel system described in §
157.002 hereof. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all
design features.
      (4)   Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities
shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety
and welfare. Storm water runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum and
turbulent conditions at an outfall control structure will not be permitted
without complete protection for the public safety. The use of restrictive
fences shall be kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other
method is feasible.
   (F)   Rooftop and paved storm water storage areas.
      (1)   Rooftop storage shall be designed with permanent-type control
inlets and parapet walls to contain runoff on the rooftop. Emergency overflow
areas shall be provided to insure that the weight of water stored will not
exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
      (2)   Paved surfaces that are to serve as storm water storage areas shall
have minimum grades of 1% and shall be restricted to storage depths of one foot
maximum. Release rates and storage volume requirements for paved storage areas
remain the same as outlined in §
157.002 hereof. If a portion of an area within a storm water storage area is to
be paved for parking or recreational purposes, the paved surface shall be
placed at the highest elevation within the storage area as possible. Maximum
parking lot grades shall not exceed normal design parameters of 3% to 5%.
   (G)   Plans and approval required. Plans, specifications and all
calculations for storm water runoff control as required hereunder shall be
submitted to the city for review and approval prior to the approval of a final
plat, in the case of subdivisions, or issuance of a building permit, in the
case of planned unit developments, commercial, industrial, or qualifying
residential construction. Final engineering plans and calculations shall show
complete details for all of the items covered in this chapter and shall be
submitted for review and approved prior to the start of construction.
   (H)   Control facilities constructed first. Where development of a property
presents the threat of flooding or damage by flash runoff to downstream
residents, the facilities for storm water runoff control shall be constructed
prior to any earthmoving or drainage construction on the project site.
   (I)   Construction precautions. During the construction phases of land
development, facilities shall be provided to prevent the erosion and washing
away of the earth. Refer to §§
157.004,
157.005 and
157.999 for regulations concerning controlling erosion and sedimentation during
development.
(Ord. 3270, passed 8-28-00)
§ 157.004 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   Objective. It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion
and sedimentation resulting from development activities in the city. Measures
taken to control erosion and sedimentation should be adequate to assure that
sediment is not transported from the site by storm events of a ten year
frequency, or less. The following principles shall apply to all development
activities within the city; and division (B)(9) below shall apply to all sites
at all times, regardless of whether development activities are being performed
on the site.
   (B)   General design principles.
      (1)   Site development should be planned so that it is consistent with
and conforms to the topography and soils of the site so as to prevent and
minimize soil erosion. Radical cuts and fills should be avoided in areas of
steep slopes. Natural contours should be maintained as much as possible.
      (2)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses shall be left
undisturbed wherever possible to form a buffer to keep soil on the site. At a
minimum, the undisturbed areas of natural vegetation shall be at least twenty-
five feet wide.
      (3)   The area of land exposed during site development should be limited
to the smallest working area practicable. The period of time during which land
is exposed without vegetation should be limited to the shortest period
practicable and should be during periods of the least intense rainfall.
Stripping and excavation should be minimized. Vegetative cover should be
restored at the earliest possible time. Large topsoil stockpiles and land
removal of topsoil should be minimized. Topsoil stockpiles should be
revegetated during periods of extended use.
      (4)   For channelized or concentrated flows, sediment basins, debris
basins, desilting basins, or silt traps should be installed and maintained to
remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development. To remove
sediment from sheet flow run-off, silt fence, filter fence, or vegetative
filter strips should be used. These control devices shall be installed prior to
work starting in the development and shall remain in place until vegetative
cover is re-established permanently, and all other permanent control devices
are installed and functioning.
      (5)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should
be based on the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to
contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and benefits
involved.
      (6)   Aesthetics, public health and the requirements of continuing
maintenance should be considered in the design and implementation of erosion
control facilities and practices as part of an erosion and sedimentation
control plan.
      (7)   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased water run-off
caused by changed soil and surface conditions both during and after
development. Drainage ways should be designed and constructed so that their
final gradients and the resultant velocities of water will not create
additional erosion on site or beyond the project limits.
      (8)   Permanent vegetation and hydraulic structures should be established
and installed as soon as practicable during development.
      (9)   Measures shall be taken to prevent tracking of mud and sediment
onto public ways. This shall include, as a minimum, a means of vehicular egress
from the site that has installed therein a rock driving surface, underlain with
filter fabric, which extends back on to the development site at least 30 feet
from the paved road surface on a single residence lot, and 70 feet from the
paved road surface for all other developments. The rock composing this means of
egress shall be IDOT coarse aggregate gradations CA-1 or CA-2. This rock
surface shall be replenished and maintained so that it serves the purpose for
which it is intended throughout the period of development. Any mud or sediment
that does get deposited on a public way via vehicle or other means, shall be
removed within two hours so as to prevent any accumulation.
   (C)   Erosion and sedimentation control plans. All commercial, industrial,
residential, and planned development projects shall have erosion and
sedimentation control plans prepared and submitted to the city for review prior
to commencing. Said plans shall show:
      (1)   Existing topography of the site and adjacent land within 100 feet
of the boundaries, drawn at no greater than one foot contour intervals and
clearly portraying the topography and drainage pattern of the area.
      (2)   The location of existing buildings, temporary structures,
utilities, water bodies, flood plains, hydraulic structures, paved areas and
other significant natural or man-made features on the site and adjacent land
within 100 feet of the boundary.
      (3)   Proposed use of the site, including present development and planned
development and utilization; areas of excavation, grading, and filling;
proposed contours, finished grades, and street profiles; provisions for storm
drainage, including the control of accelerated erosion, with a drainage area
map and computations; kinds and locations of utilities; and areas and acreages
proposed to be paved, covered, sodded or seeded, vegetatively stabilized, or
left undisturbed.
      (4)   All erosion and sedimentation control devices, structures or
measures necessary to comply with the general principles of this chapter and
the standards set forth herein. The erosion and sedimentation control plan
shall show all such devices, structures or measures to be employed temporarily
during development of the parcel and to be employed permanently upon completion
of development. These measures shall be shown on the detailed grading plan.
      (5)   Provisions for maintenance of erosion and sedimentation control
devices, structures or measures.
      (6)   Identification of the person(s) who will have responsibility for
maintenance of erosion and sedimentation control devices, structures and
measures, during and after development is completed.
      (7)   As a minimum measure, staked hay bales or acceptable alternatives
shall be properly placed around the frames of all open lid structures, e.g.
storm sewer inlets, during construction to prevent sediment from clogging
sewers and ditches and polluting or silting drainage facilities, watercourses
or bodies of water. Where needed to reduce erosion and sediment movement from
sheet flow, silt filter fence or vegetative filter strips shall be used.
   (D)   Special precautions. If at any stage of development, the City Engineer
determines that the nature of the site, parcel or lot is such that further work
already authorized may cause harm or accelerated erosion to any property,
public way, watercourse, drainageway, hydraulic structure or other structure,
the City Engineer may require that such reasonable special precautions be taken
as are necessary or appropriate to avoid such harm or accelerated erosion.
"Special precautions" may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the
following requirements: a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage structures, berms, terracing, compaction, cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, other temporary structures, implementation
of recommendations of a soils engineer and/or engineering geologist, or
completion of work in stages so as to insure completion of protective measures
or devices by specified dates.
   (E)   Upon finding by the City Engineer that the plans submitted are in
compliance with this chapter, work directly covered by the plans may commence
as approved.

   The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations for the location, installation, operation, and maintenance of solar
energy systems. Solar energy systems include photovoltaic, thermal collector,
or any other solar powered system to be installed on property within the limits
of the city.
(Ord. 3930, passed 5-29-18)
§ 160.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   GLARE. The effect produced by light with an intensity sufficient to cause
annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
   PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL. A semiconductor device that converts solar energy
directly into electricity.
   SOLAR COLLECTOR. A professionally manufactured device, structure, or part of
a device or structure, for which the primary purpose is to transform solar
radiant energy into thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy.

energy for use in the collector's energy transformation process. Collector
surface does not include frames, supports, and mounting hardware.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, BUILDING-INTEGRATED. A building-mounted solar energy
system that is an integral part of a principal or accessory building, rather
than a separate mechanical device, replacing or substituting for an
architectural or structural part of the building. BUILDING-INTEGRATED SOLAR
ENERGY SYSTEMS include, but are not limited to, photovoltaic cell or hot water
systems that are contained within roofing materials, skylights, shading
devices, and similar architectural components.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, BUILDING-MOUNTED. A solar energy system in which all
parts are professionally mounted on the roof of a principal building or
accessory structure. A BUILDING-MOUNTED SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM includes building
integrated solar energy systems, flush- mounted solar energy systems, and non-
flush-mounted solar energy systems.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, FLUSH-MOUNTED. A building-mounted solar energy system
that is mounted to a finished roof surface where the solar collector, once
installed, projects no further than six inches in height beyond the roof
surface.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, GROUND-MOUNTED. A free-standing solar energy system
that is placed, affixed, or mounted to the ground.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, LARGE. A solar energy system that contains multiple
solar collectors and is primarily used to produce energy to be sold
commercially.

once installed, projects more than six inches in height beyond the roof
surface.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, SELF-CONTAINED. A professionally manufactured device
that utilizes solar collector(s) to produce small amounts of power that are
generated exclusively for the device. A SELF-CONTAINED SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM is
typically located in areas that are not in close proximity to a utility power
source. Examples of these types of SELF-CONTAINED SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS include,
but are not limited to, light poles in parks for security or safety reasons,
pedestrian street crossing signs that alert oncoming traffic of the crossing,
natural resource observation systems (such as tracking flood level depths),
pumps that aerate an isolated pond, and attic fans mounted on a roof that are
used for ventilation purposes.
   SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, SMALL. A professionally manufactured system accessory
to the principal use that utilizes solar collectors to convert solar energy
from the sun into thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy for storage and
use, and is intended to primarily reduce on-site consumption of utility power.
Energy produced in excess of on-site consumption may be sold back to the
electric utility service provider that serves the proposed site for use with
the existing energy grid.
