(Ord. 2521, passed 1-11-2000; Ord. 2573, passed 1-8-2002; Ord. 3150, passed 11-

Â§ 30.05 REMOTE MEETING ATTENDANCE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Policy statement. It is the policy of the city that any member of the
City Council may attend and participate in any open or closed meeting of the
City Council from a remote location via telephone, video or internet
connection; provided that, such attendance and participation is in compliance
with this policy and any other applicable laws.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Prerequisites. A member of the City Council may attend from a remote
location if the member meets the following conditions, a quorum is physically
present throughout the meeting and a majority of a quorum of the City Council
votes to approve the remote attendance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The member should notify the City Clerk/Finance Director at least
24 hours before the meeting so that necessary communications equipment can be
arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result in
denial of a request for remote attendance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The member must assert one of the following three reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the city; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a quorum is
physically present, any member present may move that a member be permitted to
participate remotely, specifying the reason entitling the absent member to
participate remotely. All of the members physically present are permitted to
vote on whether remote participation will be allowed. The motion must be
approved by a vote of a majority of the quorum.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Adequate equipment required. The member participating remotely and
other members of the City Council must be able to communicate effectively, and
members of the audience must be able to hear all communications. Before
approving remote attendance at any meeting, the city shall provide equipment
adequate to accomplish this objective.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Minutes. Any member participating remotely shall be considered an off-
site participant and counted as present by means of video or audio conference,
for that meeting if the member is allowed to participate. The meeting minutes
shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is physically
present, present by video or present by audio means.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Rights of remote member. A member permitted to participate remotely
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
The remote member shall be heard, considered and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any remote member shall be called during any vote
taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the Clerk/Finance Director
and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member participating
remotely may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Meetings. The term MEETING, as used herein, refers to any gathering,
whether in person or by video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic
means (such as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat and
instant messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive
communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held
for the purposes of discussing public business.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Closed meetings. A quorum of the City Council must be physically
present at any closed meeting. Members participating remotely shall otherwise
be entitled to participate in closed meetings by video or audio conference, in
the same manner as at an open meeting.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Committees, boards and commissions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â This policy shall apply to all committees, boards and commissions
established by authority of the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â However, when remote attendance is possible only by audio
connection, and an off-site member will be unable to view visual exhibits or
demonstrations which may influence a decision by the committee, board or
commission, remote attendance should not be approved.
(Ord. 2734, passed 2-13-2007)
Â§ 30.06 PRESIDING OFFICER.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Mayor shall be the presiding officer of the Council at all
meetings.

at a regular or special meeting, the meeting will be led by Mayor Pro Tem.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Mayor Pro Tem shall rotate by quarter based on the years of
service of each councilman, if willing to serve.

serve as Mayor Pro Tem for the first quarter, third most years of experience
shall serve as Mayor Pro Tem for second quarter, and fourth most years of

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Â§ 34.001 GENERAL PURPOSE/SCOPE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â This manual is a general informational guide to the cityâ€™s current
employment policies and shall not be construed as a contract, implied or
otherwise. The city reserves the right to amend, delete, supplement or rescind
any of the provisions of this manual, as the city deems necessary and
appropriate, without advance notice. These policies shall not be construed to
create contractual rights or any type of promise or guarantee of specific
treatment upon which any employee may rely. The city also reserves the right to
deviate from these policies at any time, in order to achieve its primary
mission of providing orderly and cost efficient services to its citizens.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â These personnel policies shall apply to all city employees. They shall
not apply to elected officials and independent contractors. In the event of
conflict between any specific provision of this manual and any provision of a
valid and effective collective bargaining contract, the terms of the collective
bargaining agreement will govern the particular issue with regard to employees
covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Rules and regulations of Board
of Police Commissioners will take precedence with regard to particular issues
covered thereby for employees covered by those rules and regulations. In all
other cases, these policies shall govern.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.002 NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Employment with the city is voluntary on the part of both parties.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All employment with the city is on an at-will basis.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â As such, either the employee or the city may terminate the employment
relationship at any time, with or without cause, as either party may deem
appropriate.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.003 ADMINISTRATION OF RULES BY CITY MANAGER.
Â Â Â The City Manager shall administer or cause to be administered the provisions
of this manual. The City Manager shall be responsible for the resolution of any
problem or problems which may arise regarding the personnel policies, with the
advice and consent of the City Council, except where the duties by statute are
the sole and exclusive duties of the City Manager.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.004 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city is an equal employment opportunity employer. The city
employs, retains, promotes, terminates and otherwise treats all employees and
job applicants on the basis of merit, qualifications and competence. This
policy shall be applied without regard to any individualâ€™s sex, race, color,
religion, national origin, age, marital status or disability.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city will not discriminate against applicants or employees with a
disability. However, to be considered as a qualified candidate/employee with a
disability, the individual must have the ability to perform the essential
functions of the position, either with or without reasonable accommodations.
The city engages in the interactive process with employees. As such, any
employee needing an accommodation should make this known to their supervisor.
The city will engage in the interactive process in an attempt to accommodate
individuals with disabilities.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Employees with life threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart
disease or AIDS/HIV conditions, or communicable diseases such as tuberculosis
or influenza, are treated the same as all other employees. They are permitted
to continue working so long as they are able to maintain an acceptable level of
performance and medical evidence shows they are not a threat to themselves or
their co-workers. The city will work to preserve the safety of all of its
employees and reserves the right to reassign employees or take other job
actions when a health or safety risk to fellow city employees or the public
exists.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.005 SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â It is the policy of the city to provide a work environment for its
employees which is free from discrimination and intimidation. The city will not
tolerate any form of unlawful harassment. Prompt disciplinary action will be
taken against an employee who commits or participates in any form of unlawful
harassment, which includes harassment based on an individualâ€™s sex, race,
color, religion, national origin, age, citizenship status, marital status,
handicap or disability.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â It is unlawful to harass a person because of that personâ€™s sex.
The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination
under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â SEXUAL HARASSMENT is defined as unwanted, unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature when:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either
implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of an individualâ€™s employment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for any employment related decision affecting the individual;
or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individualâ€™s work performance, or creating an offensive,
intimidating, degrading or hostile work environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Such conduct is illegal. Examples of sexual harassment may include
sexual innuendos, suggestive or insulting sounds, unauthorized touching of a
sexual nature, making requests for sexual favors, pressure to engage in sexual
activity as a condition of employment or promotion, leering or ogling, telling
jokes or stories of a sexual nature, or textual or electronic messages with
sexual content.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If an employee feels he or she is being harassed based upon his or her
sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, citizenship status, marital
status, handicap or disability, he or she should at once make his or her
feelings known to his or her immediate supervisor, either as an electronic or
direct communication. All complaints will be investigated and, where
appropriate, disciplinary action taken. If the employee feels that the matter
cannot be discussed with his or her supervisor, or if he or she is not
satisfied with the way his or her report has been handled, he or she should
arrange for a conference with the City Manager to discuss the complaint.
Remember, do not assume the city is aware of harassment. It is the employeeâ€™s
responsibility to report incidents he or she knows about.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In addition, employees who believe they are being harassed may
contact the State Department of Human Rights at (217)785-5100 or the State
Human Rights Commission at (217)785-4350. Remedies available through the Human
Rights Department and Human Rights Commission in case of a valid substantiated
complaint may include, but are not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Cease and desist orders;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Actual damages;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Hiring, reinstatement, promotion, back pay and employee
benefits;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Attorneyâ€™s fees and costs;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Compliance reports;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Posting of compliance notices; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Loss of public contracts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Employees who file a complaint with the city, or the Human Rights
Department will not be retaliated against based on such complaint. No
individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in
good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected
from retaliation. The State Officials and Employees Ethics Act provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action and retaliation is a civil
rights violation according to the Illinois Human Rights Act.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â This policy refers not only to supervisor/subordinate actions, but
also applies to action between co-workers. Harassment of our employees in
connection with their work by non-employees may also be a violation of this
policy. Any employee who becomes aware of any harassment of an employee by a
non-employee should report such harassment to his or her supervisor.
Appropriate action will be taken with respect to violation of this policy by
any non-employee.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable
pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, employee handbooks and
collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition of Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by
the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to
local ordinance, State law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a
separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate
and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or
penalties imposed by a court of law or State or Federal agency.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Making a false report is a violation of the city sexual harassment
policy. An employee knowingly making a false report will be subject to
discipline up to and including termination. In addition, any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor
and subject to an administrative fine.

Â§ 34.010 WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION POLICY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Purpose. The City of Greenville provides whistleblower protections in
two important areas: confidentiality and against retaliation. The
confidentiality of a whistleblower will be maintained to the extent allowable
by law, however, an identity may have to be disclosed to conduct a thorough
investigation, to comply with the law and to provide accused individuals their
legal rights of defense. A whistleblower may also waive confidentiality in
writing. The municipality will not retaliate against a whistleblower. This
includes, but is not limited to, protection from retaliation in the form of an
adverse employment action such as termination, compensation decreases, or poor
work assignments and threats of physical harm. Any whistleblowers who believe
they are being retaliated against must submit a written report to the Auditing
Official within 60 days of gaining knowledge of the retaliatory action. The
right of a whistleblower for protection against retaliation does not include
immunity for any personal wrongdoing that is alleged and investigated.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires

municipality that is undertaken in violation of a federal or state law or local
ordinance; is an abuse of authority; violates the public's trust or expectation
of their conduct; is of substantial and specific danger to the public's health

the scope of the employee's, elected official's, board member's, commission

municipality who:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Reports an improper governmental action as defined under 50 ILCS

governmental actions from the applicable Auditing Official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Auditing Officials may reinstate, reimburse for lost wages or
expenses incurred, promote or provide some other form of restitution.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In instances where an Auditing Official determines that restitution
will not suffice, the Auditing Official may make their investigation findings
available for the purposes of aiding in that employee's, or the employee's
attorney's, effort to make the employee whole.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Auditing Officials are responsible for reading the full context of
Â§ 4.1 and complying with all requirements.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Duties of an employee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All reports of illegal and dishonest activities will be promptly
submitted to the Auditing Official who is responsible for investigating and
coordinating corrective action.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If an employee has knowledge of, or a concern of, improper
governmental action, the employee shall make a written report of the activity
to the Auditing Official. The employee must exercise sound judgment to avoid
baseless allegations. An employee who intentionally files a false report of
wrongdoing will be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The whistleblower is not responsible for investigating the activity
or for determining fault or corrective measures; a designated Auditing Official
is charged with these responsibilities.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Â§ 1836) compliance. Section 7(b):
"Immunity from Liability for Confidential Disclosure of a Trade Secret to the

liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a
trade secret that: (a) is made: (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local
government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii)
solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of
law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or
other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use of trade secret information in anti-retaliation lawsuit. An
individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the
individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the
individual: (a) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and
(b) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order."
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Employee acknowledgment. Employees are required to sign a written
acknowledgment that they have received, read and understand this policy, and to
submit that acknowledgment to the Auditing Official or other designated
official of the municipality. The form that is attached to Ord. 3254 will
satisfy this requirement upon receipt.

Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â A normal working schedule for regular, full-time employees consists of
40 hours each work week. Different work schedules, such as in the case of

head will advise the employee regarding their specific working hours.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Part-time and special assignment employees will work hours as
specified by their department heads.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All city positions are designated as either â€œexemptâ€ or â€œnon-exemptâ€
according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (â€œFLSAâ€) regulations. Whether an
employee is classified as exempt of non-exempt depends upon factors such as
level of responsibility, prior knowledge and experience, education level and
pay structure. The City Manager will determine how each position will be
classified.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â For most city employees, the established work period is 40 hours
within a seven-day work week. For law enforcement employees, the established
work period is 80 hours during a 14-day period.

Â§ 34.022 COMPENSATORY TIME.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Non-exempt employees entitled to overtime pay may elect to receive
compensatory time off instead of cash payment. This is approved on a case-by-
case basis by the employeeâ€™s department head. If the compensatory time option
is exercised, the employee is credited with one and one-half times the hours
worked as overtime. Maximum accruals of compensatory time shall be limited to
40 hours for regular employees. After maximum accrual, overtime compensation
shall be paid.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Employees may use compensatory time within a reasonable time period
after making a request to their department head, unless doing so would unduly
disrupt city operations. Compensatory time should be used for short-term
absences from work during times mutually agreed to by the employee and the
department head. Accumulation of compensatory time to be used as a substitute
for extended vacation time off is not normally permitted.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If an employee is unable to use accrued compensatory time within a

notify their supervisor as soon as possible, ordinarily before the work day
begins or within 30 minutes of the employeeâ€™s usual starting time. If an
absence continues beyond one day, the employee is responsible for reporting in
each day. If the supervisor is unavailable, the employee may leave a message
with the City Managerâ€™s office or Police Dispatch, stating the reason for being
late or unable to report for work.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â An employee who is absent without authorization or notification is
subject to disciplinary action, including termination.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Employees who exhibit excessive absenteeism or tardiness are subject
to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)

perform the assigned city job. Examples include, but are not limited to,
outside employment which:

city property or city time, a contribution for a partisan political cause.

Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city recognizes that employees may have interests in events and
organizations outside the workplace. However, employees may not solicit or
distribute literature concerning these activities during working time
(including the working time of the employee who is soliciting and the working
time of the employee being solicited). Working time does not include, for
example, lunch periods, work breaks or any other periods in which employees are
not on duty.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Employees may not distribute literature at any time for any purpose in
working areas. Working areas are defined as all areas of the property in which

Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If an employeeâ€™s license is revoked, suspended or lost, or is in any
other way not current, valid and in the employeeâ€™s possession, the employee
shall promptly notify the department head and will be immediately suspended
from driving duties. The employee may not resume driving until proof of a
valid, current license is provided to the department head.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Depending on the duration of license suspension, revocation or other
inability to drive, an employee may be subject to disciplinary action,
including termination. In addition, if an employeeâ€™s driving record is
unacceptable to the city as determined in its sole discretion, an employee may
be discharged even if the employee has a valid driverâ€™s license.

Â§ 34.140 SUBSTANCE ABUSE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city may discipline or terminate an employee possessing,
consuming, controlling, selling or using alcohol, drugs or other controlled
substances during work hours. The city may also discipline or terminate an
employee who uses alcohol, drugs or other controlled substances which, in the
cityâ€™s opinion, impairs the employeeâ€™s work performance, poses a threat to the
public confidence, or is a safety risk to the city or others. The city is
committed to supporting employees who undergo treatment and rehabilitation for
alcohol or other chemical dependency before such use results in unsatisfactory
job performance or a situation where the employee is at work with drugs or
alcohol in their system.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Employees who voluntarily report an alcohol, drug or controlled
substance dependency problem will not be subject to retaliation or
discrimination. Employees who voluntarily seek treatment may use sick leave to
attend a bona fide treatment or counseling program. The city may condition
continued employment on the employeeâ€™s successful completion of treatment or
counseling programs and future avoidance of alcohol, drugs or other controlled
substances.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â An employee may be required to submit to alcohol, drug or controlled
substance testing at any time in the cityâ€™s sole discretion. Refusal to submit
to testing, when requested, may result in immediate disciplinary action,
including termination. In addition, if any test reveals the presence of any
illegal drug or alcohol, the employee will be subject to immediate discharge.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Employees using any prescription or over the counter drugs which might
impair their work performance should notify their department head. At the
option of the department head, an employee may be reassigned to less hazardous

threat to the public confidence or to the safety of the employee or others.

termination. Continued poor performance or failure to successfully complete an
assigned rehabilitation program may result in termination.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Employees who are required to maintain a commercial driverâ€™s license
(CDL) are subject to random drug testing as required by the Federal Government

(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.142 COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city recognizes that sometimes situations arise in which an
employee feels that they have not been treated fairly or in accordance with
city rules and procedures. For this reason, the city provides its employees
with procedures for resolving complaints.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Step 1. An employee should first try to resolve any problem or
complaint with the supervisor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Step 2. When normal communication between an employee and the
supervisor is not successful, if the employee does not believe the issue can be
discussed with his or her supervisor, or when an employee disagrees with the
application of city policies and procedures, the employee should attempt to
resolve the problem with the department head. The department head will respond
to the employee in writing within five days after meeting with the employee, if
possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Step 3. If the employee is not satisfied with the response from the
department head, the employee may submit the problem, in writing, to the City
Manager. The written complaint must contain, at a minimum:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A description of the problem;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A specific policy or procedure which the employee believes has
been violated or misapplied;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The date of the circumstances leading to the complaint or the
date when the employee first became aware of those circumstances;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The remedy sought by the employee to resolve the complaint; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The written complaint should be filed within ten working days of
the occurrence leading to the complaint, or ten working days after the employee
becomes aware of the circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The City Manager may meet with the parties, either individually or
together, and the City Manager will respond in writing to the aggrieved
employee, usually within ten days of the meeting. The City Managerâ€™s response
and decision shall be final and binding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Certain employees may have more than one source of dispute
resolution rights (i.e., a collective bargaining agreement, if any) and this
complaint process. Employees represented by a bargaining unit should follow
grievance procedures set out in their respective labor contracts where
applicable. In all other cases, the procedures described in this section shall
be used. Under no circumstances shall an employee have the right to utilize
both this process and any other complaint or appeal procedure that may be
available to an employee.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
DISCIPLINE AND TERMINATIONS
Â§ 34.155 DISCIPLINE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All employees are expected to exercise good judgment, loyalty, common
sense, dedication and courtesy in the performance of their duties. The primary
mission of every employee is to provide courteous, orderly, efficient and
economic delivery of services to the citizens of the city.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Acts, errors or omissions which discredit the public service or impair
the provision of orderly services to the citizens of the city may result in
discipline, including termination.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The City Manager or department head, as appropriate, has full
discretion and authority to impose disciplinary action in accordance with city
policy and the circumstances of the particular case.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The following are examples of the types of behavior which may result
in discipline:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Drinking alcohol or the abuse of non-prescription or prescription
drugs or other controlled substances on the job, or arriving on the job or
being at work while in possession of alcohol, drugs or other controlled
substances, or with alcohol or drugs in the employeeâ€™s system;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Violation of a lawful duty;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Insubordination;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Absence from work without first notifying and securing permission
from the supervisor;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Excessive absence or tardiness for any reason;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Unsatisfactory job performance, as determined by the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Acceptance of fees, gratuities or other valuable items in the
performance of the employeeâ€™s official duties for the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Inability, refusal or failure to perform the duties of the assigned
job; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Violation of duties or rules imposed by this manual, or by any
other city rule, regulation or administrative order.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â This list is not all-inclusive, but only serves as a general guide.
The city may discipline or terminate employees for other reasons not stated
above. In the event that discipline is necessary, the following types of
disciplinary actions may be used, depending on the particular situation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Oral warning. An oral warning is a counseling session between the
employeeâ€™s supervisor and the employee on the subject of the employeeâ€™s conduct
and performance, or their failure to observe a rule, regulation or
administrative instruction. It is intended to increase an employeeâ€™s efficiency
and value to the city by changing the employeeâ€™s conduct, attitude, habits or
work methods. Following the counseling session the supervisor shall document
the oral warning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reprimand. A reprimand is a formal written disciplinary action for
misconduct, inadequate performance or repeated lesser infractions. Written
reprimands are placed in the employeeâ€™s personnel file.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Suspension. A suspension is a temporary, unpaid absence from duty
which may be imposed as a penalty for significant misconduct or repeated lesser
infractions. A suspension is a severe disciplinary action which is made part of
the employeeâ€™s permanent record.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Discharge. Depending upon all of the relevant circumstances,
including the nature of the conduct, and the employeeâ€™s general record, an
employee may be discharged for a single act of misconduct.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Suspensions with pay, where the employee is placed on administrative
leave, may be utilized by the City Manager pending the results of an
investigation or disciplinary action where the City Manager determines that
factors such as public confidence, the safety of the employee or the efficient
functioning of the city call for such a suspension.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.156 TERMINATION.
Â Â Â An employee may be terminated from city employment at any time, with or
without cause or advance notice. This includes situations where the City
Council or City Manager has made a determination that a lack of work or funding
exists with respect to the employeeâ€™s position.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.157 PRE-TERMINATION HEARING.
Â Â Â In the case of termination of an employee, the city will conduct a pre-
termination hearing.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â In the event an appointing authority desires to terminate an employee,
the employee shall be provided with a notice of the recommendation for
termination. The notice shall include an explanation of the reasons on which
the recommendation is based, and the time and date for a pre-termination
hearing. If the employee fails or refuses to appear, the termination may
proceed.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Pre-termination hearings will be presided over by the City Manager or
a designated representative.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â At the hearing, the employee may explain why the employee should not
be terminated. The employee may bring one person to the hearing as an observer
or representative. The City Manager shall determine who, if anyone, may
participate in the hearing, and how the hearing will be conducted.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Usually within five working days after the pre-termination hearing,
the City Manager will issue a decision on whether the termination will proceed,
or whether lesser disciplinary action will be applied. However, if the City
Manager determines that more information or time is required in order to render
a decision, the City Manager may extend the time period as he or she deems
appropriate.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The decision of the City Manager will be final.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.158 LAYOFF.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The City Manager may lay off employees for lack of work, budgetary
restrictions or other changes that have taken place.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Special assignment employees or employees who have not completed their
introductory period will be laid off before regular employees are affected.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â In determining who is to be laid off, consideration will be given to
individual performance and the qualifications required for remaining jobs.
Length of service will be considered when performance and qualifications are
equal.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Employees who are laid off may be eligible to be re-employed, if a
vacancy occurs in a position for which they are qualified. However, such
employeeâ€™s have no right to be recalled, and will be recalled only if the city
deems it to be in the cityâ€™s best interests at the time the recall occurs.
(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)
Â§ 34.159 RESIGNATION.
Â Â Â An employee should provide two weeksâ€™ notice of resignation. This time limit
may be waived by the employeeâ€™s department head or the City Manager.

Â§ 34.160 DEATH.

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

hearing is concluded, the Commission shall either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Dismiss the complaint; or

notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and
stateâ€™s hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection (A) need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under Â§
53.094 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Â§Â§
53.090,
53.092 and
53.093 of this chapter.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â In the case of any new regulations under Â§ 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Code Enforcement
Officer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and the
stateâ€™s hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.087) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.098 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.

Â§ 53.099 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Except as indicated in subsection (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is feasible, the Code Enforcement Officer
may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Samples of oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides
and volatile organic compound must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.

Â§ 53.101 RECORD KEEPING.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the date analyses were performed;
who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three years.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Code Enforcement
Officer.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
Â§ 53.130 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
Â Â Â When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Code Enforcement Officer may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within 14 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Code Enforcement Officer. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Code Enforcement Officer to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.110) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.131 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
Â Â Â When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.111) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.132 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.

(2000 Code, Â§ 53.112) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.133 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the user may be fined in an
amount not to exceed $500.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Said fine shall be calculated based on a 50% surcharge of the
userâ€™s average daily water usage for each day the violation exists, unless, in
the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer, the violation was willful and did
substantial harm to the system, in which case the maximum fine shall be
assessed for each day or part thereof for which the violation existed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â All said fines shall be billed with and be a part of the userâ€™s
water and sewer bill.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â  (1)Â Â Â Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 15 days of being notified of the fine.

on the matter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In the event the userâ€™s appeal is successful, the payment, together
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Code Enforcement Officer may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.113) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.134 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Code Enforcement Officer may immediately suspend a userâ€™s
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The Code Enforcement Officer may also immediately suspend a userâ€™s
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a userâ€™s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Code
Enforcement Officer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The Code Enforcement Officer may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Code
Enforcement Officer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in Â§
53.135 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Code Enforcement Officer prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under Â§
53.135 of this chapter.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.114) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.135 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â In addition to the provisions in Â§

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Refusal of reasonable access to the userâ€™s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Violation of the pretreatment standards in Â§Â§
53.020 through
53.024 of this chapter.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action

be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.115) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
Â§ 53.150 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
Â Â Â When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the city may petition the Circuit Court through the City Attorney
for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the
user. The Code Enforcement Officer may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.125) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.151 CIVIL PENALTIES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for
actual damages and the cost of repair or replacement of the system.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city may recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, court costs and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the userâ€™s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.126) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.152 REMEDIES NON-EXCLUSIVE.
Â Â Â The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The city may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the cityâ€™s enforcement response plan. However, the city may take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.127) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION
Â§ 53.165 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.
Â Â Â Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will only recommence, at the userâ€™s expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.135) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.166 PUBLIC NUISANCES.

be subject to the provisions of the city code governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or
remedying said nuisance.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.136) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
Â§ 53.180 UPSET.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include non-compliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper
operation.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection (C) below, are met.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The user has submitted the following information to the Code
Enforcement Officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.145) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.181 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
Â Â Â A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for non- compliance with the general prohibitions in Â§
53.020(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in Â§Â§
53.020(B) through
53.024 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to
know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the userâ€™s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.146) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.182 BY-PASS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â For the purposes of this section, BY-PASS means the intentional
diversion of waste streams from any portion of a userâ€™s treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a by-pass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â A user may allow any by-pass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These by-passes are
not subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) below.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a user knows in advance of the need for a by-pass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Code Enforcement Officer, at least ten days before
the date of the by-pass, if possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A user shall submit oral notice to the Code Enforcement Officer of
an unanticipated by-pass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the by-pass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the by-pass. The written submission shall contain a description of the by-pass
and its cause; the duration of the by-pass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the by-pass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the by-pass. The Code Enforcement Officer may waive the written
report on a case-by- case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â By-pass is prohibited, and the Code Enforcement Officer may take
an enforcement action against a user for a by-pass, unless:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â By-pass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â There were no feasible alternatives to the by-pass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal period of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a by-pass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C)
above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Code Enforcement Officer may approve an anticipated by-pass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Code Enforcement Officer
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1)
above.
(2000 Code, Â§ 53.147) (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)
Â§ 53.999 PENALTY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500 per violation, per day.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $500. This
penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury
or property damage available under state law.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
$500 per violation, per day.

special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Green indication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in Â§

unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Â§
70.17 of this chapter, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall
then start to cross the roadway.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Steady red indication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as provided in subsection (C)(3) below, vehicular traffic
facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain standing until an indication to
proceed is shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Except as provided in subsection (C)(3) below, vehicular traffic
facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the
movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a
movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line,
but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection or, if there is no such crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain standing until an indication
permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the city
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subsections (C)(1) or (C)
(2) above. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in Â§
70.17 of this chapter, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow
signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable, except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the absence of
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given
the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the â€œDonâ€™t Walkâ€ signal or
upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady or flashing.

where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
Â§ 71.001 SPEED LIMITS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of the city at a speed which
is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic conditions and
the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any person or
property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable
maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed
when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going
around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any narrow or
winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or
other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be
decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on
or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of
all persons to use due care.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
subsections (C) and (D) below, by Â§
71.002 of this chapter or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in Â§
70.01 of this code of ordinances) for all vehicles is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Thirty mph; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Fifteen mph in an alley.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in a non-urban district shall be as determined under
625 ILCS 5/11-601.
(625 ILCS 5/11-601) (2000 Code, Â§ 71.001) Penalty, see Â§
71.999

Â Â Â Authority to regulate speed, see 65 ILCS 5/11-40-1 and 625 ILCS 5/11-604
Â§ 71.002 SPECIAL SPEED LIMITS WHILE PASSING SCHOOLS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â For the purpose of this section, a SCHOOL DAY begins at 7:00 a.m. and
concludes at 4:00 p.m.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â On a school day when school children are present and so close thereto
that a potential hazard exists because of the close proximity of the motorized
traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess of 20 mph
while passing a school zone, or while traveling upon any public thoroughfare
where children pass going to and from school.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs
are posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located. The signs shall
give proper due warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall
indicate the school zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school
days when school children are present.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special school speed zone
indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall evidence obtained
thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speed; provided, the use of the
device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in the special
school speed zone.
(2000 Code, Â§ 71.002) Penalty, see Â§
71.999
Statutory reference:
Â Â Â For similar provisions under state law, see 625 ILCS 5/11-605
Â§ 71.003 MAXIMUM ATTAINABLE OPERATING SPEED.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â No person shall drive or operate any motor vehicle on any street or
highway in the city where the minimum allowable speed on that street or
highway, as posted, is greater than the maximum attainable operating speed of
the vehicle.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Maximum attainable operating speed shall be determined by the
manufacturer of the vehicle and clearly published in the manual of
specifications and operation, or it shall be determined by applicable rule and
regulation promulgated by the Secretary of State.
(625 ILCS 5/11-611) (2000 Code, Â§ 71.003) Penalty, see Â§
71.999
Â§ 71.004 MINIMUM SPEED REGULATION.
Â Â Â No person shall drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to impede or
block the normal and regular movement of traffic, except when reduced speed is
necessary for safe operation of his or her vehicle or in compliance with law.
(625 ILCS 5/11-606(a)) (2000 Code, Â§ 71.004) Penalty, see Â§

available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle and,
after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so as to leave the
intersection in a lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction
upon the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be
made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The stateâ€™s Department of Transportation and local authorities in
their respective jurisdictions may cause official traffic-control devices to be
placed within or adjacent to intersections and thereby require and direct that
a different course from that specified in this section be traveled by vehicles
turning at an intersection, and when such devices are so placed no driver of a
vehicle shall turn a vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and
required by such devices.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Two-way left turn lanes. Where a special lane for making left turns by
drivers proceeding in opposite directions has been indicated by official
traffic-control devices:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A left turn shall not be made from any other lane; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane, except when preparing

upon any curve, or upon the approach to or near the crest of a grade, where the
vehicle cannot be seen by the driver of any other vehicle approaching from
either direction within 500 feet.
(625 ILCS 5/11-802) (2000 Code, Â§ 71.021) Penalty, see Â§
71.999
Â§ 71.022 STARTING PARKED VEHICLE.

71.999
Â§ 71.023 WHEN SIGNAL REQUIRED.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â No person may turn a vehicle at an intersection unless the vehicle is
in proper position upon the highway as required in Â§
71.020 of this chapter, or turn a vehicle to enter a private road or driveway,
or otherwise turn a vehicle from a direct course, or move right or left upon a
roadway unless and until the movement can be made with reasonable safety. No
person may so turn any vehicle without giving an appropriate signal in the

Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The electric turn signal device required in 625 ILCS 5/12-208 must be
used and operated as prescribed in division (B) of this section to indicate an
intention to turn, change lanes, turn a vehicle from a direct course, move
right or left upon a highway, or start from a parallel parked position. Unless
the conditions of division (B) of this section are met, an electric turn signal
device required in 625 ILCS 5/12-208 shall not be left in the on position and
must not be flashed on one side only on a parked or disabled vehicle, or
flashed as a courtesy or â€œdo passâ€ signal to operators of other vehicles
approaching from the rear. However, signal devices may be flashed

hazardous proximity to the crossing; and/or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A railroad train is approaching so closely that an immediate
hazard is created.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Whenever any person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined
in 625 ILCS 5/6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is
not always required to stop, the person must exercise due care and caution as
the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and
under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop
within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad
and shall not proceed until the tracks are clear and he or she can do so
safely. The foregoing requirements shall apply when:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;

plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Whenever a person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in
625 ILCS 5/6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not
always required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care
and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning
of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this Section, the
driver shall slow down within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the
nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she checks that
the tracks are clear of an approaching train or railroad track equipment.

right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions
and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly marked stopped line or, if
no stop line, within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet, from the nearest rail
of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she can do so safely. If a
driver is involved in a collision at a railroad crossing or interferes with the
movement of a train after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the
collision or interference is prima facie evidence of the driverâ€™s failure to
yield right-of-way.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.

to implement a strict and enforceable system to prevent the illegal sale of
cigarettes and other tobacco products to minors.

addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country.

among persons who have ever tried a cigarette, more than 80% reported having

smoking precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use.

and safety of the residents of the city, particularly those residents under 18
years of age.

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspectâ€™s escape.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by
a police officer, or where a â€œno loiteringâ€ sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit or lie in or upon any public or quasi- public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private property
utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free
passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any person to block, obstruct or prevent
free access to the entrance to any building open to the public.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACEÂ is an area generally
visible to public view, including streets, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas,
parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles (whether moving or not), and
buildings open to the general public, including those which serve food or drink
or provide entertainment, and the doorways and entrances to buildings or
dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

Â§ 134.02 OBSCENITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity when, with
knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he or she:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver
or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment of the obscene;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or
participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene;

or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â â€œObsceneâ€ defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Interpretation of evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults; except
that, it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits
of the material or absence thereof;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age; and/or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

130.99
Â§ 134.03 HARMFUL MATERIAL.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Elements of the offense. No person, with knowledge that a person is a
child (that is, a person under 18 years of age), or who fails to exercise
reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, shall knowingly
distribute to, send or cause to be sent to, or exhibit to, or offer to
distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â DISTRIBUTE. To transfer possession of, whether with or without
consideration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â HARMFUL. Material is harmful if, to the average person, applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or
excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming
social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â KNOWINGLY. Having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter, or
recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed
the contents thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â MATERIAL. Any writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Interpretation of evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall
be judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the
child to whom the material was offered, distributed, sent or exhibited, unless
it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its
dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially
susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall
be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of
production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity
indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of
the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Affirmative defenses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years of age; provided,
such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational purpose;
and it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a violation of
this section that the act charged was committed in aid of legitimate scientific
or educational purposes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing
to his child any harmful material.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child, shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: a document issued by
the federal government or any state, county or city government or subdivision
or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operatorâ€™s
license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service
Act, being 50 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 201 et seq., or an identification card issued to a
member of the armed forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in
this section culminates in the sale or distribution of harmful material to a
child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the
child by the defendant, his or her employees, or agents, as where the order or
request for harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone or similar
means of communication, and delivery of the harmful material to the child was
by mail, freight or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this section that the advertisement contained
the following statement, or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that
the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he or she was not under 18
years of age and that the purchaser falsely stated that he or she was not under
18 years of age:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€œNOTICE: It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to
purchase the matter herein advertised. Any person under 18 years of age who
falsely states that he is not under 18 years of age for the purpose of
obtaining the material advertised herein, is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor
under the laws of the State of Illinois and a violation of Â§
134.03 of the City Code of Ordinances.â€
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Child falsifying age. No person under 18 years of age shall falsely
state, either orally or in writing, that he or she is not under the age of 18
years, or present or offer to any person any evidence of age and identity which
is false or not actually his or her own for the purpose of ordering, obtaining,
viewing or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any harmful
material.

Â§ 150.03 REPEAT OFFENDER.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â REPEAT OFFENDER. A person, whether owner or tenant, in lawful control of
real property within the cityâ€™s jurisdiction on which two or more violations of
any city codes other than criminal have occurred during any 365-day period, as
a result of two separate unresolved events where notification has been sent to
such individual by the Code Enforcement Officer.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Designation. A person shall be classified as a repeat offender only by
the recommendation of the Code Enforcement Officer and approval by the City
Manager. If a person has failed to resolve more than two citations in a 12-
month period, the Code Enforcement Officer may seek repeat offender status for
that person. The City Manager shall review the request and grant or deny the
status in writing within 14 days. The Code Enforcement Officer shall notify any
person classified as a repeat offender in writing with no less than 14 daysâ€™
notice to that person. That person may appeal the repeat offender designation
to the Board of Adjustment. The repeat offender designation shall be determined
at the sole discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer with the City Managerâ€™s
approval. Any such approval will establish a period of time a person will
remain in repeat offender status or no less than 12 months, but no longer than
24 months. A person will remain as a repeat offender for the appointed amount
of time and until all outstanding fines/fees are paid. Citations used as
justification for deeming a person a repeat offender cannot be used as
justification for future recommendations of repeat offender status.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Enforcement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In addition to all of the procedures set forth in the City of
Greenville Code as revised from time to time, enforcement action shall be
enhanced against designated repeat offenders. No personal contact or notices of
violation shall be required of the Code Enforcement Officer in advance of a
citation and the Code Enforcement Officer may issue citations to designated
repeat offenders immediately upon confirmation of a code violation. Repeat
offenders should be issued a citation in writing for all offenses after
receiving the repeat offender designation. Any citation given to a repeat
offender shall have five business days, or other time frame by agreement in
writing with the Code Enforcement Officer, to correct the deficiencies cited.
If the deficiencies have not been corrected in the specified time, a notice of
fine shall be issued in writing to the offender.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the offense is not resolved within seven days, the city may act
to immediately remedy the offense using city personnel or contracted labor. Any
expense related to this action may be filed as a lien on the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Code Enforcement Officer may also institute a program of
regular inspections involving properties of repeat offenders without the
necessity of complaints. The names of designated repeat offenders may be made
public by use of the cityâ€™s website or other appropriate means.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The City of Greenville Code is amended to provide that this chapter
shall be enforced by any Code Official or Code Enforcement Officer designated
by the City Manager.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Penalties. If a designated repeat offender is cited for a violation of
the provisions of the Property Maintenance Code, amendments to Property
Maintenance Code and/or nuisances set out in the City of Greenville Code and
the citation is not contested, a fine of $250 minimum and $750 maximum shall
apply; however, the City Manager may waive any or all of the fine for an
uncontested violation, if in his or her discretion, the City Manager determines
that such waiver will promote compliance with this section. If the designated
repeat offender contests the citation and/or fine, the offender may file an
appeal for a hearing before the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment
may also classify all such civil fines as daily fines until the violation is
remedied. The Board of Adjustment findings that assess the civil fines and
remedy charges against repeat offenders shall also authorize the city to file
civil actions in the appropriate Bond County court against the repeat offender
to collect the civil fines and remedy charges, including foreclosure actions if
deemed appropriate by the city.

proof condition, extermination shall be the responsibility of the owner or
operator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Every owner or operator shall be responsible for extermination of
any insects, rodents or other pests whenever infestation exists in two or more

every habitable room therein, except where there are separate heating
facilities for each dwelling unit, whose facilities are under the sole control
of the occupant of such dwelling unit.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Utilities. No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service
equipment or utility which is required by this subchapter to be removed, shut
off or discontinued for any occupied dwelling let or occupied by him or her,
except for such temporary interruption as may be necessary while actual repairs
or alterations are in process, or during temporary emergencies.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Janitorial service. Every dwelling of two or more dwelling units in
which the owner or operator does not reside shall have a janitor as found
necessary by the Building Inspector.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Transfer of responsibility. A contract effective as between the owner
and operator, operator and occupant, or owner and occupant, with regard to
compliance hereunder shall not relieve any part of his or her direct
responsibility under this subchapter.

occupant in writing either by insertion in the lease between the parties or
otherwise of the maximum number of occupants permitted in the occupied premises

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Engaging in the construction, repair or alteration of any building

10.99
RESIDENTIAL RENTAL OCCUPANCY
Â§ 150.50 OCCUPANCY PERMIT REQUIRED; CHANGE IN POSSESSION OR OCCUPANCY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful for the
owner or any agent of an owner to permit the occupancy by any third party of
any residential dwelling unit within the city until such time as an occupancy
permit has been issued by the city. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit
the transfer of ownership of the dwelling or dwelling unit prior to the
issuance of an occupancy permit so long as subsection (B) hereof is complied
with fully.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â It shall be the responsibility of the owner or lessor of any
residential property located within the city to assure that an occupancy permit
will be issued or is issued to any occupant assuming possession from the owner
or lessor of the property; and, if necessary, to provide for the corrections of
any violations whether such corrections take place prior to or after a transfer
of ownership or possession of the property and before the issuance of the
occupancy permit. However, if the owner, seller, lessor or transferor provides
a true and correct copy of this subchapter to the purchaser, transferee, or
lessee and thereafter obtains the purchaser's, transferee's or lessee's written
consent to assume full responsibility to obtain the occupancy permit and, if
necessary, to correct any violations that may exist to obtain such occupancy
permit then, upon filing an original of the written consent signed by the party
to be so bound, with the city's Code Enforcement Officer, the obligation to
correct any such violations prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit shall
then be the responsibility of the purchaser, transferee, or lessee, who shall
be bound thereby without further notice.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â This section shall not apply to transfers of residential real estate
wherein the transferee notifies
the Code Enforcement Officer, in writing, of intent to demolish within 90 days
of the transfer any building located thereon. The Code Enforcement Officer may,
for good cause shown, extend the demolition period for one additional period of
90 days. No overnight occupancy shall be allowed within any dwelling or
dwelling unit that is subject to this demolition exception.

38.01 herein and said fee shall be submitted to the city along with the
occupancy permit application. There shall be no fee in connection with the
first inspection.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The minimum standard for a property to pass an occupancy inspection
for the issuance of an occupancy permit is that the property being inspected
must not contain any deficiencies in construction or maintenance that could
impact the life, safety, or health of the occupants of the dwelling or dwelling
unit, including but not by way of limitation all state statutes for the
installation of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If the inspection of a residential property identifies deficiencies
that fail to meet the minimum standards for the issuance of an occupancy
permit, then a written list of deficiencies shall be provided to the owner to
be corrected. Once the deficiencies are corrected the Code Enforcement Officer
shall reinspect at no charge and if the deficiencies have been corrected the
Code Enforcement Officer shall issue an occupancy permit.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â An additional fee as set forth in Â§
38.01 herein shall be charged in connection with each subsequent inspection if
an inspection of a residential property indicates that the residential dwelling
fails to meet the minimum standards for the issuance of an occupancy permit.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â An additional fee as set forth in Â§
38.01 herein shall be charged if the applicant or their agent fails to be
present at the appointed time scheduled for an inspection unless written,
telephone, or email notice of the cancellation of a scheduled inspection is
delivered to the Code Enforcement Officer at least 24 hours in advance of the
scheduled inspection.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Any occupancy permit may be revoked or suspended by the Code
Enforcement Official upon a showing that an occupancy permit or interim
occupancy permit was issued through the use of a false or misleading
application or any untruthful statement contained upon such application.
(Ord. 3192, passed 3-21-2019; Ord. 3369, passed 7-8-2025)
Â§ 150.52 VIOLATIONS.

150.50 through
150.52 shall be fined not less than $200 and not more than $250 per day for
each day the violation is to have occurred. For any owner who is found to be in
violation of this subchapter for a second or more offense, within a five year
period, the fine shall be $500 per day for each day the violation is found to
have occurred.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The city shall also be entitled to a reimbursement of its attorney
fees, court costs, and expenses of litigation incurred in the successful
prosecution of any violation of this subchapter.
(Ord. 3192, passed 3-21-2019)
Â§ 150.53 INSPECTIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Upon proper application for an occupancy permit, the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designee shall cause an inspection to be made of the
premises in question to determine if an occupancy permit may be issued. If the
inspection is satisfactory, the Code Enforcement Official shall issue an
occupancy permit which shall be valid until the next change of occupancy or
until the occupancy permit is revoked by the Code Enforcement Official as
provided in Â§
150.51.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Properties that have a third-party inspection system, such as a HUD
housing inspection, shall provide that inspection to the Code Enforcement
Official as a substitute for the inspection in subsection (A) above with the
consent of the Code Enforcement Official.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The specifications for the occupancy permit inspection will be
available at the cityâ€™s Municipal Building and made available to the public.
The specifications shall be based on the then-adopted version of the
International Property Maintenance Code.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â All inspections are to be conducted by the cityâ€™s Code Enforcement
Official or his or her designee.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The property owner may submit to the Code Enforcement Official, a
request for property code hardship exemption of a residential occupancy
checklist code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The request must be in writing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The request must detail reason(s) the property code exemption
should be granted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The request must specify why fixing the deficiency would create a
significant hardship. The hardship must be significant and not merely an
inconvenience to resolve.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The property code hardship exemption shall not create a life safety
issue.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The request will be reviewed by the Code Enforcement Official, and
must be approved by the Code Enforcement Official and the City Manager to be
granted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The property code hardship exemption will be reviewed during
subsequent inspections and may be revoked if conditions change.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true
intent of this code, or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been,
incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of this code do not fully apply, or the
requirements of this code are adequately satisfied by other means.

chapter.

(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0002 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
Â Â Â In accordance with state law, (see 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1 et seq.), this code
regulates lots, structures, and land uses. It is the intent and purpose of this
code to assist in achieving the following:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â To promote and protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort, and
general welfare of the people;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â To serve as an implementing tool of comprehensive planning;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â To establish reasonable standards to which buildings or structures
shall conform;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â To encourage the development and arrangement of land uses and
structures that will yield the greatest social and economic benefits for the
city;
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â To provide adequate light, air, privacy, and safe, convenient access
to property;
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â To divide the city into zoning districts restricting and regulating
the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, and use of
buildings, structures, and land for residential, business manufacturing and
other specified land uses;
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â To establish minimum requirements and standards for development and
redevelopment within the area of the city's jurisdiction to achieve reasonable
initial costs and to reduce future maintenance costs of public and private
improvements and services;
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â To conserve the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the
municipality.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0003 JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â This code shall be applicable within the corporate limits of Greenville and
within all territory located in Illinois within said limits, provided such
territory is not located within the zoning jurisdiction of another
municipality.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0004 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
Â Â Â Every provision of this code shall be construed liberally in favor of the
city, and every requirement imposed herein shall be deemed minimal. Whenever
the requirements of this code differ from the requirements of any other
lawfully adopted and effective ordinance, regulation, deed restriction, or
covenant, the more stringent requirement shall prevail.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0005 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
Â Â Â Except as may be provided otherwise by statute or ordinance, no official,
board member, agent, or employee of the city shall render himself personally
liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any
act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under this code (see
"Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act," 745 ILCS 10/
1-101 et seq.). Any suit brought against any official, board member, agent, or
employee of the city, as a result of any act required or permitted in the
discharge of his duties under this code, shall be defended by the City Attorney
until the final determination of the legal proceedings.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0006 SEVERABILITY.
Â Â Â If any provision of this code is declared unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, that decision shall not affect the validity of
the remainder of this code.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0007 EXISTING RESTRICTIONS.
Â Â Â Where this code imposes a greater restriction upon land, buildings or
structures than is imposed or required by existing provisions of law,
ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this code shall govern.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0008 EXISTING PERMITS.
Â Â Â This code is not intended to abrogate or annul any building permits,
certificates of occupancy, variances or other lawful permits issued before the
effective date of this code.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0009 COMPLETION PERMITTED.
Â Â Â Any building or structure for which a building permit has been issued prior
to the date of enactment of this code may be completed and used in accordance
with the plans, specifications, and permits on which said building permit was
granted, provided construction commences within 180 days of passage of this
code and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0010 SEPARABILITY.
Â Â Â If any part or provision of this code or the application thereof to any
person, property, or circumstance is adjudged invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation and direction to
the part, provision, section or application directly involved in the
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the integrity or validity of the remainder of this code or the
application thereof to other persons, property or circumstances. The City
Council hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of this code
even without any such part, provision, section, or application.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)

not conform (does not meet the regulations of this code in some way). A
nonconforming use may often have a detrimental effect on the land use around
it, such as increased traffic on residential streets, not enough parking space,
the emission of noxious fumes, the creation of loud noises or a depressing
effect on property values. These regulations are intended to minimize the
existing and/or potential problems created by nonconforming uses.

effective date of this code or of amendments hereto, may be completed in
accordance with the approved plans, provided construction is started within 180
days and diligently prosecuted to completion. Such building shall be thereafter
deemed to be a lawfully established building.

conforming use to any portion of a nonconforming building shall not be deemed
the extension of such nonconforming use.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a use of the same or
greater nonconformity with the district regulations of the district in which it
is located and when changed to a use of a greater conformity shall not
thereafter be changed to a use of lesser conformity; however, in the LI,
Industrial Light District a nonconforming use shall not be changed to a
nonconforming residential use.

consecutive months such use shall not thereafter be resumed and any future use
of the premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this code,
provided that, such nonconforming use may be resumed when the owner during the
period of discontinuance, has been actively attempting to continue such
nonconforming use.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Proof of fact in writing must be furnished to the Chief Building and
Zoning Official by the applicant to establish intent not to abandon.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â When any nonconforming mobile home has been removed from a lot, such
use shall not thereafter be resumed, and any future use shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this code.

Â§ 153.0124 REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE AND ALTERATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Ordinary repairs and maintenance of a nonconforming building shall not
be deemed an extension of such nonconforming building and shall be permitted.

time, the building or other structure can be rebuilt or used thereafter only
for a conforming use and in compliance with the provisions of the district in
which it is located. In the event the damage or destruction is less than 50% of
its value, based upon the prevailing costs, the building may then be restored
to its original condition and the occupancy or use of such building may be
continued which existed at the time of such partial destruction.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â In the event that the Chief Building and Zoning Official's estimate of
the extent of damage or fair market value is not acceptable to the applicant
for the building permit to repair or reconstruct such building or structure,
the applicant may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Officer.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In any event, restoration, or repair of the building or other
structure must be started within a period of six months from the date of damage
or destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Conditions. The City Council may issue, or cause to be issued, a
building permit if the subject matter thereof is otherwise permitted by the
provisions of this article, provided that the City Council may impose such
conditions and requirements to the issuance of the permit as are reasonably
necessary to promote compatibility of the nonconforming use or building with
its immediate neighborhood and to protect adjacent property from any adverse
effects of the nonconforming use.

Official shall require the property owner to obtain a signed, written opinion
from a qualified soils scientist or related professional determining if larger
lots are necessary for the proper functioning of the individual sewage disposal
system to prevent the possibility of health hazards. If lots larger than those
required by the zone district are indicated as necessary, the Chief Building

Â§ 153.0144 MINIMUM BUFFER STANDARDS.
Â Â Â Required buffer yards shall comply with the minimum standards in this
section. Figure 1 provides illustrations of acceptable buffering techniques.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Natural buffers. At a minimum, natural buffers shall consist of
existing vegetation that provides an opaque natural visual screen to a height
of at least six feet, or any combination of existing and replanted vegetation
that can reasonably be expected to create an opaque visual screen at least six
feet high within five growing seasons. Natural buffers may contain deciduous or
perennial vegetation, but shall contain evergreen shrubs, bushes, and trees
suitable to local growing conditions that will provide an opaque visual screen
during all seasons of the year, in accordance with the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Natural buffers shall include at least one evergreen shrub planted
every four feet, at least one evergreen tree planted every 25 feet, and at
least one deciduous tree planted every 50 feet. The minimum width of all
natural buffers shall be 20 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The retention of existing vegetation should be preserved to the
maximum extent practical. The addition of new vegetation may be required if
vegetation retained is not sufficient.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Natural buffers shall be sufficient in opacity to screen automobile
headlights from areas zoned residential or agriculture. The city may require a
landscaped berm or a structural buffer, such as walls or fences, to achieve the
desired level of screening needed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Generally, all trees and bushes used within a required buffer area
shall be adequate in quantity and type to provide the necessary screening or
buffering as determined by the city. Buffer areas shall comply with the
standards in Table 1 and Figure 1 of this division.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Structural buffers. Structural buffers shall meet the following
criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Structural buffers shall be vegetated throughout the minimum area
required for the buffer around any fences or walls and upon any earthen berms,
which may include grass, ground covers, shrubs, and trees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Structural buffers shall include at least one evergreen shrub
planted every ten feet, at least one evergreen tree planted every 25 feet, and
at least one deciduous tree planted every 50 feet. The minimum width of all
structural buffers shall be ten feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All earthen berms shall have a maximum side slope of three
horizontal to one vertical. Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the
drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Fences and freestanding walls of brick, stone or ornamental
concrete shall meet the standards of the applicable sections of the city's code
and shall be designed to present a finished and decorative appearance on both
sides. Unless otherwise waived by the Chief Building and Zoning Official,
fences and walls shall be placed on the property line, and the shrubs, ground
covers, or other vegetation shall be provided on the interior side of the fence
or wall.

Â§ 153.0145 MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE.
Â Â Â Upon request by the applicant, the City Council may consider and approve
alternatives to full compliance with the landscaping, screening, and buffering
standards contained in this division if the associated visual impact is
mitigated to the maximum extent feasible by the alternative landscaping and
screening plans. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to
increased setbacks, increased landscaping, additional fencing, and
architectural treatments or otherwise camouflaging equipment or, with prior
City Council approval, the planting and maintenance, or payment therefore, of
adjacent public right-of-way landscaping. The Chief Building and Zoning
Official may waive a buffer requirement or reduce its extent to a temporarily
appropriate level of screening if the Future Land Use Map in the Greenville
Comprehensive Plan designates adjoining property in a land use category such
that a buffer would not be required by this chapter once the adjoining property
is rezoned or developed.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0146 INSTALLATION.
Â Â Â All landscaping shall be installed prior to issuance of any temporary or
final occupancy permit, unless a hardship is determined to exist by the Chief
Building and Zoning Official. In such event, the landscaping improvements shall
be secured with a letter of credit or other acceptable surety.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0147 MAINTENANCE.
Â Â Â The applicant, developer, landowner, and successors in interest shall be
jointly and severally responsible for the regular maintenance of all
landscaping elements, whether located on private common ground or private
property, in accordance with the approved landscaping plan. Trees and
vegetation, irrigation systems, fences, walls, and other landscape elements
shall be considered required elements of a development in same manner as
parking, building materials, and other site requirements imposed by the final
plat, site plan or development plan. When a buffer is required, the owner shall
maintain the landscaping and screening to provide an opaque visual screen to a
height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis. All landscaping shall be
maintained free of disease, pests, weeds, and litter. All landscape structures
such as fences, walls and planters shall be repaired and replaced periodically
to maintain them in a structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing condition.
Any landscape element located on the owner's property that dies, or is
otherwise removed or seriously damaged, shall within 30 days of the beginning
of the growing season be replaced based on the requirement of this division. If
the owner fails to fulfill his or her obligation in this regard during an 18-
month period after installation of the landscaping, the city may complete the
performance and seek reimbursement from the owner.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0148 LANDSCAPE CREDIT.
Â Â Â Any existing trees on a site that are in appropriate locations and of
acceptable quality may be credited towards fulfillment of any landscaping
provisions of this chapter on a caliper inch per basis at the discretion of the
Chief Building and Zoning Official.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
DIVISION VII: SITE PLAN REVIEW
Â§ 153.0150 PURPOSE.
Â Â Â The purpose of the site plan review procedures is to enable the city to
consider potential impacts upon the area in the vicinity of the property,
consistency with good planning practices, and to ensure high standards of site
and building design for the general welfare of the city and its residents.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0151 APPLICABILITY.
Â Â Â An approved site plan is required in the R2, R3, R4, D, CG, CN, IL, IH, and
PD zoning classifications for the development or redevelopment of any parcel of
land proposed for any land use, except single-family and two-family dwellings,
uses customarily accessory to single-family and two-family dwellings, and
agricultural uses which do not involve additional impervious surfaces. An
approved site plan is required for all proposed developments in the NB, CB, HB,
and IL zoning classifications. The contents for any site plan prepared for a
Planned Use or for a Planned Development District shall meet the requirements
set forth in this division; provided, however, the procedures for review and
approval of such site plans shall be governed by the review and approval
sections applicable to Planned Uses and Planned Development Districts,
respectively.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Types of site plans.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Major site plans. A "major site plan" is defined as a plan for
the development of a parcel of land that currently contains no buildings or for
which the existing buildings are to be removed and a new building or buildings
constructed. In addition, a major site plan is required for any development
that is adding more than 5,000 square feet of new impermeable surface to a site
or when stormwater detention is required in accordance with the Greenville
Subdivision Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Minor site plans. A "minor site plan" is defined as a plan for
the expansion, change in use, or redevelopment of a site that already contains
a building or buildings and which does not add more than 5,000 square feet of
new impermeable surface to a site. A minor site plan may be approved by the
Chief Building and Zoning Official if it meets all of the requirements of this
Zoning Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within this section, references to site plans include requirements
for both major and minor site plans. Requirements that deal specifically with
major site plans or minor site plans are so indicated.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Relationship to other ordinance requirements. The requirements,
procedures, and standards contained in this section are in addition to the
requirements, procedures, and standards contained in other sections of this
Zoning Code, which shall remain applicable to the parcel for which the
application is filed. In case of conflict between the general provisions and
district regulations of this Zoning Code with the provisions of this section,
the more restrictive requirements shall control.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0152 SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
Â Â Â An applicant for a site plan shall comply with the following procedural
requirements:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An applicant shall confer with the Chief Building and Zoning
Official, or his/her designee, to become familiar with the city's regulations
and requirements affecting the zoning district in which the parcel in question
lies and shall obtain copies of all city ordinances pertaining to procedures
and requirements for site plan approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An application may be made by the owner or by a contract purchaser.
Written consent of the owner shall be required if the applicant is not the
owner. All owners must join if more than one.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The written application for review and approval of the site plan
shall be filed on a form supplied by the Chief Building and Zoning
Administrator and shall be accompanied by a site plan that meets the
requirements of this section. The application shall be signed by the applicant
and shall state the name and address of the applicant and of the owner, if
different. If the applicant is not the owner, the application shall identify
the applicant's specific contractual interest in the property. A fee for
reviewing the site plan shall be paid to the city at the time of filing the
application.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Review of application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Upon receipt of an application completed in satisfactory form, the
Chief Building and Zoning Official shall deliver a copy of the application and
accompany documents, including the site plan, to the appropriate city
departments for their review and comments on the impact of the proposed
development on health, safety, traffic, public services, or facilities and
other relevant considerations, in both the area of the project, and other areas
of the city which may be affected. Such comments shall be sent to the Chief
Building and Zoning Official and forwarded to the applicant within 21 days of
the receipt of the completed application by the Chief Building and Zoning
Official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within 21 days from the forwarding of comments to the applicant,
the applicant shall advise the Chief Building and Zoning Official of the
applicant's desire to revise said application and site plan based on the city's
comments or proceed to a review by the Plan Commission, if said application is
for a major site plan. If the applicant opts to proceed to a review of the
major site plan by the Plan Commission, the application shall be placed on the
agenda of the next available meeting of the Plan Commission. If the applicant
desires to revise the major site plan, the applicant shall make the desired
revisions and resubmit the application and site plan to the Chief Building and
Zoning Official for review in the same manner as the first submittal.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Major site plan approval. The Plan Commission shall review the major
site plan at a regular meeting, and the major site plan shall be approved,
disapproved, or approved with conditions. In determining whether to approve,
disapprove, or approve the major site plan with conditions, the Plan Commission
shall consider:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All relevant information, including the comments of city officials,
the major site plan's consistency with good planning practices, its
compatibility with adjacent developments and uses, and its effect on the
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the residents of the area in the
vicinity of the property subject to the major site plan and upon the residents
of the city generally.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The likely effect of the major site plan on vehicular or pedestrian
traffic, fire hazards, emergency services, utility services, municipal
expenditures, stormwater drainage and control facilities, and environmental
aspects.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Minor site plan approval. The Chief Building and Zoning Official may
approve a minor site plan if said site plan complies with all requirements of
this Zoning Code. If the Chief Building and Zoning Official disapproves the
minor site plan, the disapproval shall include, in writing, the reasons for the
disapproval. Any disapproval may be appealed to the Zoning Hearing Officer in
accordance with the applicable sections of this code.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Validity of site plan. Approval of a site plan shall be valid for a
period of 12 months from the date of approval by the city. If no building
permit is obtained during that period, the approval shall terminate. The Plan
Commission may grant extensions of time not to exceed 12 months each, upon
written request of the applicant for a substantially similar major site plan,
provided that the request is filed prior to the expiration date. The Plan
Commission may attach new conditions when an extension is granted. If, in the
opinion of the Plan Commission, the application contains substantial changes to
the originally approved plan, a new major site plan review process must occur,
including payment of a new application fee. The same procedure stated herein
shall be followed by the Chief Building and Zoning Official for minor site
plans.

Â§ 153.0161 HOME OCCUPATIONS, FARM.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Explanation. There are significant differences between urban home
occupations and farm home occupations. The nature of resources available for
use, the benefits and disadvantages created by home occupations and the
problems generated necessitate a distinction between urban home occupations and
farm home occupations. Each concept is based on supplementing income, but the
district in which each is practiced has unique characteristics. For the
aforesaid reasons, different home occupations may be permitted in agricultural
zoning districts than are permitted in the residential districts.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any home occupation shall be clearly supplementary to the principal
use of the land and structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A home occupation may not be changed to another home occupation
except by the issuance of a separate permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If any "A" District or part thereof is rezoned the rezoned area
shall meet the new district regulations and any home occupations shall be
considered a nonconforming use until such requirements are met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Parking requirements shall be met as required by the applicably
sections of the city's code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â No sign shall be permitted larger than that allowed for an urban

Council.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Complaints. The Chief Building and Zoning Official shall investigate
complaints concerning home occupations and file a written report of his
findings with the home occupation permit. If, after investigation and report,
the Chief Building and Zoning Official determines that the home occupation is
in violation of the performance requirements of this Section, a corrective
action order will be issued to the operator.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Chief
Building and Zoning Official may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Officer in
accordance with the procedures as outlined in the city's code.

DIVISION II: PLANNED USE
Â§ 153.0175 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
Â Â Â One of the principal objectives of the Zoning Code is to provide for a
compatible arrangement of uses of land and buildings that is consistent with
the requirements and welfare of the city. To accomplish this objective, most
uses are classified as "permitted uses" or "conditional uses" in one or more of
the districts established by the Zoning Code. However, it is recognized that
there are certain uses that, because of their scope, location, or specific
characteristics, require a more comprehensive consideration of their impact,
both with regard to the neighboring land and the city in general. Such uses
fall within the provisions of this division and shall only be permitted if
authorized as a planned use. It is the intent of this division to authorize
these "planned uses" only where the location and circumstances are appropriate
to the use and a site plan is approved by the City Council. It is also the
intent of this division to increase the flexibility of development design
through evaluation and approval of a site plan applying site-specific
regulations.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0176 PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â A petition for a planned use shall be filed with the city in
accordance with this chapter. Applications for a planned use shall specify the
intended land use, complete with a description of said use and the underlying
zoning district or districts. The underlying conventional zoning district(s),
use regulations or other regulatory provisions shall apply except as
specifically adjusted for the particular development, such as, but not limited
to, reduced lot sizes or setbacks.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Approval of a planned use and corresponding site plan shall be
considered a legislative act of rezoning. The public hearing and public notice
requirements for a planned use shall be the same as for any rezoning as
provided by the regulations defined in this code. If the applicant submits a
preliminary site plan for review by the Plan Commission, and the Plan
Commission approves such preliminary site plan, no additional public hearing
before the Plan Commission shall be required for the final site plan, unless
there are material changes to the site plan. A governing ordinance for each
planned use shall be established at the time of the rezoning. The governing
ordinance shall approve a final site plan and may specifically set forth the
specific uses, authorized density and/or building coverages, design
requirements, public improvements, and other conditions or requirements of the
approved site plan. The site plan and all development conditions shall be
attached to the ordinance authorizing the planned use and be entitled
"Attachment A."

approval herein are satisfied. Any site features or improvements intended to
justify a modification in the underlying district regulations shall be clearly
identified on the site plan.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0179 CONSIDERATION OF A PLANNED USE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Procedure. Except as established by this division, the procedures and
requirements for filing, review, and approval of a site plan for a planned use
shall be the same as those set forth in this chapter and all other requirements
necessary for making amendments to a zoning district or boundaries.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Criteria for approval. The City Council shall use the applicable
underlying zoning district regulations as a guide for review of the site plan.
The City Council may permit modification from the underlying district
regulations. Use regulations, however, shall not be modified so as to allow
uses not otherwise permitted by this chapter in the zoning district governing
the property, or to which the applicant seeks rezoning. If the City Council
imposes conditions or restrictions on a preliminary site plan, it may designate
specific requirements that must be met before an applicant may submit a final
site plan application. In considering any site plan application, the Plan
Commission and the City Council may give consideration to the criteria below;
to the extent the criteria are pertinent to the particular application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Satisfaction of the conditions and requirements applicable to the
requested planned use, as set forth in this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The criteria governing the rezoning of the property, as set forth
in the standards and requirements found elsewhere in the zoning code or in
other applicable law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Development is designed, located, and proposed to be operated so
that the public health, safety, and welfare will be protected.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â An identified community need exists for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Development will not impede the normal and orderly development and
improvement of the surrounding property, nor impair the use, enjoyment, or
value of neighboring properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Development incorporates adequate ingress and egress and an
internal street network that minimizes traffic congestion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The capability of the site to accommodate the building, parking,
and drives with appropriate open space and safe, easy ingress and egress.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The degree of continuity between the architectural quality of the
proposed building and the surrounding neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The appropriateness of the minimum dimensions and areas of lots and
yards set forth in the applicable zoning district regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Development reinforces and/or complies with the standards and
principles of the Comprehensive Plan and all other adopted regulations.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Change of underlying zoning district. A planned use application may be
submitted with an application to change the underlying zoning district
category. Any preliminary site plan approved for a planned use, concurrent with
such application, shall become part of the ordinance that amends the zoning
district category of the property.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Modification of zoning map. Any approved planned use and preliminary
site plan shall be reflected on the Zoning Map as an amendment to the
underlying zoning district by designation of "P-" before the district
abbreviation of the district in which the plan was approved.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0180 FINAL SITE PLAN.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Approval if preliminary site plan submitted. Approval of a final site
plan is required any time a preliminary site plan is submitted. No building
permit shall be issued for any structure on the property until a final site
plan is approved. Within 12 months following passage of the City Council's
approval of the Planned Use and preliminary site plan, the applicant shall
submit a final site plan to the Chief Building and Zoning Official for his
review and consideration to determine if said final site plan is in conformance
with the approved preliminary site plan and with any imposed conditions of
approval. If the final site plan does not materially differ from the
preliminary site plan, no additional public hearing before the Plan Commission
shall be required. The Chief Building and Zoning Official shall submit to the
City Council a written advisory report recommending acceptance or rejection of
the final site plan. If the Chief Building and Zoning Official determines that
the final site plan materially differs from the approved preliminary site plan,
the Chief Building and Zoning Official shall recommend to the City Council that
a public hearing before the Plan Commission be conducted to review the final
site plan. Unless the City Council sends the final site plan back to the Plan
Commission, the City Council shall either accept the final site plan, by
ordinance, or reject the final site plan.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Approval if preliminary site plan not submitted. The applicant may, if
it so elects, submit a final site plan for review without submitting a
preliminary site plan. However, if the applicants elect to file only a final
site plan, the final site plan shall contain all information required to be
submitted on a preliminary site plan. If the applicant files only a final site
plan, the Plan Commission shall consider such final site plan in the same
manner that it considers preliminary site plans. No building permit shall be
issued for any structure on the property until a final site plan is approved.
The City Council shall either accept the final site plan, by ordinance, or
reject the final site plan.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Contents of final site plan. A final site plan shall include the
elements set forth in these regulations, including the following:

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Submittal requirements. The number of copies of the final site
plan, as required by the city, shall be submitted in support of the
application. The final site plan shall be accompanied by all general
application requirements and shall bear such professional certifications and
seals as the city may require.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Exterior building drawings. The application shall include detailed
drawings and perspectives depicting the general style, size and exterior
construction materials of the buildings proposed. Where several building types
are proposed on the plan, a separate drawing shall be prepared for each type.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Schedules. A schedule shall be included indicating total floor
area, land area, parking spaces, land use intensity, hours of operation of the
business, and other quantities specified in the appropriate zoning district
regulations. Construction shall commence within 12 months from the date of the
planned use designation was authorized.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Phases of development. Phases of development must be shown on the
final site plan, if applicable. If the development will occur in phases, the
applicant shall submit a site plan that also displays the entire development at
the completion of all phases. The phased development shall have the phases
clearly outlined with expected dates for beginning of construction and date of
completion of construction. No building permit shall be issued for any phase of
development until a final site plan for that phase is approved, in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Statement of need for modification from underlying zoning district
regulations. A narrative statement that explains the need for modification of
the applicable underlying zoning district regulations, if requested, shall be
submitted in support of the application for the final site plan approval. The
statement shall specifically address the precise modification requested, what
compensating factors support the modification and how the criteria for approval
herein are satisfied. Any site features or improvements intended to justify a
modification in the underlying district regulations shall be clearly identified
on the site plan.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0181 EXPIRATION OF AN APPROVED FINAL SITE.
Â Â Â Final site plan approval shall not be valid for a period longer than 12
months from the date of such approval, unless within such period a building
permit is obtained, and substantial construction is commenced. The City Council
may grant one extension of no more than 12 months upon written request of the
original applicant. An application for extension of a final site plan may be
granted, if the application is filed before the final site plan expires. Upon
granting an extension, the City Council has the authority to attach new
conditions to the final site plan as it deems appropriate. Substantial
construction as used in this section shall mean completion of at least 10% of
the construction in terms of the total expected cost of the project for which
the permit was issued.

the side yard wherein the driveway is located. Off-street parking facilities
accessory to residential use and developed in any residential district shall be
used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles or the vehicles owned or
operated by the occupants of the dwelling structures. In no instance shall a
commercial vehicle exceeding one ton capacity be parked in a residential area,
except for normal loading, unloading or service, except by a conditional use

lot on which the building or use served by such facilities is located, they
shall be and remain in the same possession or ownership as the zoning lot
occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory.
No such off-site parking facilities shall be authorized and no building permit
or occupancy permit shall be issued where the plans call for parking facilities
other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the Chief Building and
Zoning Official has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made
findings that the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and the site
of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that the off-
site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the
proposed use or building.

ARTICLE VI: ZONING PROCEDURES
DIVISION I: ZONING HEARING OFFICER, VARIANCES
Â§ 153.0212 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Â Â Â In accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-13-14.1 and other applicable authority. The
Board of Adjustment shall be appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the
City Council.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0213 POWERS AND DUTIES.
Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by
law and by this article, including the following:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Appeals. Upon an appeal from a decision by any administrative
official, including but not limited to the Board of Adjustments to decide any
question involving the interpretation of any provision or term of the City
Zoning Code ("Code"), including the determination of the exact location of any
district boundary if there is uncertainty with respect thereto, or other
claimed error in the decision or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of the code; provided that such decision shall be
bound by and consistent with the language of the ordinance or regulation at
issue.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Variances. The Board of Adjustments may vary the application of the
requirements of the code, except for use variances, as provided in this
article. The Corporate Authorities may reserve, by ordinance, any class of
variance for approval only by the Corporate Authorities. In such cases where
the City Council has reserved decision making authority, the Board of
Adjustments shall still conduct a hearing and provide notice in compliance with
65 ILCS 5/11-13-6. Any variance granted by the Board of Adjustments, not
exercised within 12 months from the date of approval, shall be deemed expired
and may be revoked by the Hearing Officer.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Use variances. To hold public hearings for applications for use
variances and to forward a written report containing findings of fact and a
separate conclusion recommendation thereon to the City Council, consistent with
65 ILCS 5/11-13-14.1.C(1), which Council may by ordinance without further
public hearing adopt any proposed use variance, or the Council may refer it
back to the Board of Adjustments for further consideration or deny the use
variance request as a final action. For purposes of this section, "use
variances" shall be any variation that authorizes any use or classification of
use to continue or commence in a zoning district in which that use is not a
permitted use by right. No variance shall be granted that shall authorize a use
that may be granted by conditional use or planned use procedures. Use variances
are not favored and shall be granted only when failure to authorize the use
denies all economically viable use of the property or similar extreme hardship
is demonstrated by the evidence presented.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Other authority. To hear and decide all other matters referred to the
City Council or upon which it is required to pass under applicable ordinance.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0214 APPEALS.
Â Â Â An appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustments by any person, firm or
corporation aggrieved by a determination or decision of any administrative
official charged with the enforcement of any provision of or regulation adopted
pursuant to the code, or by any officer, department, Council, or bureau of the
city relating to such decision. The appeal shall be taken within 45 days of the
action complained of by filing, with the City Clerk, a notice of appeal,
specifying the grounds thereof. The City Clerk shall thereupon transmit to the
Hearing Officer and the official for whom the appeal is taken all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the official appealed from certifies to the Hearing Officer after the
notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, the stay would, in his opinion, cause eminent peril to life or
property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed except by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustments or by a
Court of Record on application, or notice to the official appealed from and on
due cause shown. The Board of Adjustments may reverse or affirm wholly or
partly, or may modify or amend the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from to the extent and in the manner that the Board of
Adjustments may decide to be fitting and proper to the premises. No challenge
to any decision subject to this section shall be filed in any court until or
unless a timely appeal has been filed and prosecuted to completion by the
applicant as provided for in this article so as to establish a final appealable
decision.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0215 VARIANCES.
Â Â Â A variance may be sought by filing a written application and payment of
applicable fee to the City Clerk specifying the specific provision to be
varied, the extent of the variation, and the basis therefore and including such
requirements as are set forth in the code. The Board of Adjustments may grant a
variance only if it is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the
code and in accordance with general or specific rules adopted hereto and only
in cases where there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of any regulation of the code relating to
the use, construction, alteration of buildings, or structures or the use of
land, but in no other case. No variance may be granted to any condition or term
of a conditional use permit or planned use zoning procedure. The Board of
Adjustments may impose such conditions, safeguards, and restrictions upon the
premises, benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to reduce or minimize
any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the
neighborhood, and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these
regulations. A request for a variance, other than a use variance, may be
granted, upon a finding and determination on the record of the Board of
Adjustments that the requirements of this section are met and that all three of
the following conditions are satisfied or upon such conditions as may the Board
of Adjustments establishes as will meet such conditions:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted
to be used only under the conditions allowed by the applicable zoning
regulations;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0216 PROCEDURE.

the Board of Adjustments shall be in writing. Every appeal or application shall

time for the hearing of the appeal or application and shall give due notice
thereof to the parties and decide the matter within a reasonable time.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Hearings procedure. All hearings conducted by the Hearing Officer
shall be open to the public, held at the call of the Board of Adjustments and
at such times as he or she may determine. At hearings conducted by the Board of
Adjustments, the Chief Building and Zoning Official, or his or her designee,
shall provide the Board of Adjustments with the factual background of the
application, the request sought by the applicant, and the relevant sections of
the code. At hearings conducted by the Board of Adjustments, any interested

of Adjustments shall administer oaths and may compel attendance of witnesses.
The Board of Adjustments shall keep minutes of his or her proceedings and other
official actions. The Board of Adjustments shall adopt his or her own rules and
procedures, not in conflict with this article or applicable Illinois Statutes.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Decision and findings of fact. Every variation decision shall be
accompanied by findings of facts and shall refer to any exhibits containing
plans and specifications for the proposed use or variation, which shall remain
a part of the permanent records of the Board of Adjustments. The findings of
facts shall specify the reason or reasons for making the variation. The terms
of the relief granted shall be specifically set forth in a conclusion or
statement separate from the findings of fact. Property for which relief has
been granted shall not be used in violation of the specific terms of the
findings of fact, as the case may be, unless its authorized use is changed by
subsequent variance or ordinance. Every rule, regulation, decision or
determination of the City Council shall immediately be filed with the City
Clerk and shall be public record.

Board of Adjustments decision on an application for an appeal or variance.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Upon adoption of the motion to exercise the power of review, the
Council may act on the matter directly or first refer the matter to committee.
Before acting on the variance or appeal, the Council may set the matter for
hearing before the committee or the City Council. The Council will give written
notice of any such hearing to the applicant and all other persons who appeared
and spoke at the public hearing before the Board of Adjustments. In addition,
the Council may, in its discretion, notify and allow to be heard at the hearing

DIVISION II: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT, AMENDMENTS TO ZONING REGULATIONS AND
DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
Â§ 153.0220 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT AMENDMENTS TO ZONING REGULATIONS AND DISTRICT
BOUNDARIES.
Â Â Â The Plan Commission shall conduct all public hearings concerning conditional
use permits and amendments to zoning regulations or district boundaries and
shall issue an advisory report to the City Council concerning each application.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All advisory reports for conditional use permits shall consider at
least the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The effect the conditional use would have on the City's
Comprehensive or Land Use Plan;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The effect the conditional use would have on the health, welfare,
safety, morals and comfort of the surrounding area;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The effect the conditional use would have on schools, traffic,
streets, shopping, public utilities and adjacent properties;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Is the conditional use necessary for the public convenience at that
location;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Is the conditional use so designed, located and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Will the conditional use cause injury to the value of other
property in the neighborhood in which it is located;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Will the conditional use be detrimental to the essential character
of the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All advisory reports for amendments to zoning regulations shall
consider at the least the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purpose of
the city's zoning regulations;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The areas which are most likely to be directly affected by such
change and in what way they will be affected; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed
or changing conditions in the areas and zoning districts affected, or in the
area of jurisdiction of such changed or changing conditions.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â All advisory reports for amendments to zoning district boundaries
shall consider at the least the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Character of the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Whether the proposed district classification promotes the health,
safety, quality of life, comfort and general welfare of the city and its
planning area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Consistency with the city's Comprehensive or Land Use Plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Adequacy of public utilities and other needed public services.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Suitability of the uses to which the property has been restricted
under its existing zoning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Compatibility of the proposed district classification with nearby
properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The extent to which the proposed district classification may
detrimentally affect nearby property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Whether the proposed district classification provides a
disproportionately great loss to the individual landowners nearby relative to
the public gain.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Public hearing notice. Before giving an advisory report or an initial
recommendation on any proposed amendment to zoning regulations, district
boundaries or conditional use permit, the Plan Commission shall first conduct a
public hearing thereon, the date and place of which shall be fixed in advance
by the Plan Commission at any regular or special meeting. Notice of the time,
date, and location of such hearing and a brief summary or explanation of the
subject matter of the hearing shall be given by publishing at least one notice
thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, such publication to
be made at least 15 days before the public hearings but not more than 30 days
before the hearing.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Notice of the hearing concerning conditional use permit and amendments
to zoning regulations or district boundaries shall be sent by first class mail,
by the applicant, to property owners or persons residing on land adjacent to
the property in question, and the owners of the property in question at the
time the public notice is published. In the event that the applicant is not the
owner of the property that is the subject of the conditional use or proposed
amendment, the applicant must also send the notice to the owner of the subject
property.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Hearing on application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Plan Commission shall hear the application (or any modified
application) in accordance with its usual procedure. The Commission may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Recommend the application without conditions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Recommend the application with conditions, applicable only to
conditional use permits;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Recommend denial of the application; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Refer the application back to the applicant for modification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a conditional use application is recommended with conditions,
the application in final form shall clearly note all stipulated conditions.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â A record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the
Plan Commission shall rule. Within 15 working days following the hearing, the
Plan Commission shall file a report of the hearing and its advisory report with
the City Council.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â If the application is referred back for modification by the City
Council, the applicant may resubmit the application in accordance with the
directions of the Plan Commission, if any, otherwise in time for the next
regular meeting of the Plan Commission.

A dash (â€œ-â€) indicates prohibited uses.
(B) Uses not mentioned. A use not specifically mentioned or described by
category in the Use Matrix Table is prohibited. Evaluation of these uses shall
be as set forth in subsection (D)(1) below.
(C) Uses preempted by state statute. Notwithstanding any provision of this
section to the contrary, uses that are required to be permitted in any zoning
district by state statute may be permitted in accordance with state law whether
or not the use is included in the Use Matrix Table.
(D) Interpretation.
(1) Materially similar uses.
(a) The Code Enforcement Officer shall determine if a use not mentioned can
reasonably be interpreted to fit into a use category where similar uses are
described. Interpretations may be ratified by the city upon recommendation by
the Planning Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting. It is the intent of
this chapter to group similar or compatible land uses into specific zoning
districts, either as permitted uses or as uses authorized by a CUP. Uses not
listed as a permitted use or CUP are presumed to be prohibited from the
applicable zoning district. In the event that a particular use is not listed in
the Use Matrix Table, and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not
otherwise prohibited by law, the Code Enforcement Officer shall determine
whether a materially similar use exists in this section.
(b) Should the Code Enforcement Officer determine that a materially similar use
does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular
use not listed and the Code Enforcement Officerâ€™s decision shall be recorded in
writing. Should the Code Enforcement Officer determine that a materially
similar use does not exist, the matter may be referred to the Planning
Commission for consideration for amendment to the Zoning Code to establish a
specific listing for the use in question. Unless an appeal is timely filed per
the code, the Code Enforcement Officerâ€™s decision is valid. If, when seeking
periodic ratification of interpretations, the Code Enforcement Officer's
interpretation is reversed, then decisions made in reliance on the Code
Enforcement Officer's interpretation are in violation of the Zoning Code.
(2) Rules of construction. The Code Enforcement Officer may determine that a
use is materially similar if:
(a) The use is listed as within the same structure or function classification
as the use specifically enumerated in the Use Matrix Table, as determined by
the Land-Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning
Association (APA). The Code Enforcement Officer shall refer to the following
documents in making this determination, which documents are incorporated by
reference and are maintained on file in the office of the Planning Department:
1. LBCS Structure Dimension with Detail Descriptions (9-13-1999);
2. LBCS Function Dimension with Detail Descriptions (9-13-1999); and
3. LBCS Tables (9-13-1999). The use shall be considered materially similar if
it falls within the same LBCS classification.
(b) if the use cannot be located within one of the APAâ€™s LBCS classifications
pursuant to subsection (D)(2)(a) above, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
refer to the 1997 NAICS Manual. The use shall be considered materially similar
if it falls within the same industry classification of the 1997 NAICS Manual.
(3) In order to assist in interpretation of the Use Matrix Table, the LBCS and
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) numbers follow each use
in the use matrix. In interpreting the use matrix, the following rules of
construction apply.
(a) If a use is listed for a specific classification, while a more general
classification within the same industry classification is also listed for
another use, the specific classification governs. The specific use is not
permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the general classification
are permitted simply because they share a similar LBCS or NAICS code number.
The numbers increase as the classifications get more specific.
(b) Some uses are listed separately but fall within the same LBCS or NAICS
classification. The uses within one such classification are not permitted in
all of the zoning districts as the others simply because they fall within the
same LBCS or NAICS classification. For example, NAICS 5413 (â€œArchitectural
Engineering, and Related Services") is coded under â€œOffice, General". Assume
that the Use Matrix Table sets out a classification for â€œLaboratories,
Testing," which is NAICS 54138 (â€œTesting Laboratories", a subheading of 54183).
The latter five-digit number (i.e., 54183) is more specific than the four-digit
code (i.e., 5413). Accordingly, â€œTesting Laboratoriesâ€ is not included within
the same classification as â€œGeneral Offices". However, if â€Testing
Laboratories" had not been separately listed, it would be permitted in all
districts where â€œGeneral Offices" is permitted.

SUBDIVISION CODE
ARTICLE VIII: GENERAL PROVISIONS
Â§ 153.0300 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
Â Â Â Sections
153.0300 through
153.0387 and
Appendix B, herein referred to as the "Subdivision Code," or "code," in
accordance with Illinois state law (65 ILCS 5/11-12-4 et seq.) and the City
Comprehensive Plan and Official Map, regulates the subdivision and development
of land lying within the corporate limits of the city and within one and one-
half miles of the corporate limits of the city. Specific objectives of this
code are:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â To preserve, protect, and promote the public health, safety, and
welfare;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â To provide a pleasant living environment by furthering the orderly
layout and use of land;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â To avoid legal and other problems by requiring that subdivided land be
properly monumented and recorded;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â To conserve and increase the value of land, improvements, and
buildings throughout the city;
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â To preserve the natural beauty and topography of the city to the
maximum feasible extent;
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â To provide adequate light, air, and privacy for all residents of new
developments by preventing undue concentration of population;
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â To protect against injury or damage caused by fire, pollution,
flooding, stormwater runoff, or erosion and sedimentation;
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â To provide safe and convenient access to new developments and to avoid
traffic congestion and unnecessary public expenditures by requiring the proper
location, design, and construction of streets and sidewalks;
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â To facilitate the functionality of city infrastructure.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0301 JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â This code shall apply to all developments of land and construction of
improvements upon land, whether a subdivision platting process is required, or
a traditional subdivision exists. This code also extends to development on
tracts previously subdivided. This code, in conjunction with the City Zoning
code, shall govern the construction improvements on such tracts insofar as
these impact the city and adjoining properties, as deemed such solely by the
city. The term "development" is used throughout the code to refer to not only
subdivisions but also non-subdivision developments. For said developments that
are not subdivisions, the city reserves the right to request, not limited to,
topographical surveys, legal survey information, drainage calculations,
improvement plans, fees, and permits similar to that required for subdivisions.
All planning, engineering, surveying, permitting, fees, infrastructure costs,
and all other costs required to effect requirements of this code shall be paid
by the developer of the subdivision or development unless noted otherwise. The
city reserves the right to withhold approvals and permits in the event that the
city determines that any subdivision or development is in violation of this
code. No final plat or other instrument of conveyance shall be considered valid
until the provisions of this code have been met, as determined solely by the
city.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Subdivision plats shall be required in accordance with the State of
Illinois Plat Act. Said Act refers to "subdivision plat," interpreted to be
final plat, as defined herein. The final plat is the final instrument of the
approval process for a subdivision or development as defined by this code, the
approval process being required to conform to this city code.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0302 INTERPRETATION.
Â Â Â Every provision of this code shall be construed liberally in favor of the
city, and every regulation set forth herein shall be considered the minimum
requirement for the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0303 MORE RESTRICTIVE REQUIREMENTS APPLY.
Â Â Â Whenever the requirements of this code differ from those of any statute,
lawfully adopted ordinance or regulations, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, the more stringent requirement shall prevail. Thus, in accordance
with State law (65 ILCS 5/11-12-11), whenever this code imposes higher
standards than the Bond County subdivision codes, said higher standards shall
supersede the Bond County regulations.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0304 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Except as may be provided otherwise by statute or ordinance, no
officer, council member, agent, or employee of the city shall render themselves
personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of their duties under
this code (see 745 ILCS 10/1-101 et seq.).
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Any suit brought against any officer, council member, agent, or
employee of the city, as a result of any act required or permitted in the
discharge of their duties under this code, shall be defended by the City
Attorney until the final determination of the legal proceedings.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0305 FORMS.
Â Â Â The City Council has approved the following forms for use with this
Subdivision Code (see
Appendix A). NOTE: Certificate of Zoning Compliance, Building and Occupancy
Permits, and other zoning requirements are detailed in Chapter 40.

Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Subdivision Form 5, Petition for Subdivision Code Amendment.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0306 SEPARABILITY.
Â Â Â If any part or provision of this code or the application thereof to any
person, property, or circumstance is adjudged invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation and direction to
the part, provision, section or application directly involved in the
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the integrity or validity of the remainder of this code or the
application thereof to other persons, property or circumstances. The City
Council hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of this code
even without any such part, provision, section, or application.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)

1.Â Â Â Required pavement widths are actual widths of the paved surface
including the abutting gutter and curb and gutter. For additional
requirements see Typical Section Figures.
2.Â Â Â Upon review of any development and upon its determination by the Code
Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor, that a traffic safety or
service level concern or any other such infrastructure service or public
safety concern may reasonably exist relating to the construction or
development to be permitted by the city, the city may subsequently require
the developer, at developer's cost, to submit a traffic study or such other
study as may be needed to address the identified concern. The city may accept
such studies as presented by the developer; however, the city may require
additional studies to be prepared as necessary to ensure the standards herein
are conformed to and that the public safety and welfare is protected.
Â 
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city may, at its discretion, direct the conduct of such studies
and may require such studies to be paid for by the developer/subdivider.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Topographical considerations. Grades of streets shall conform as
closely as possible to the natural topography but shall not exceed the maximum
grade nor be less than the minimum grade indicated in the Table of Street
Design Specifications. All streets shall be arranged so that as many as
possible of the building sites are at or above street grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Through traffic discouraged. Local streets may be laid out to
discourage use by through traffic. A rectangular gridiron street pattern is the
preferred layout pattern; however, the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs,
or U-shaped streets from time to time is encouraged to effect a more desirable
street layout. When designing local streets, subdividers/developers shall be
mindful of emergency service vehicles movement requirements and restrictions,
and ease of access to underground public utilities by City Public Works
personnel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Limited access to arterials. Where a subdivision abuts or contains
an existing or proposed arterial street, the Plan Commission may recommend to
the City Council that access to said arterial be limited by one of the
following means:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The subdivision of lots so that they back onto the arterial
street and front onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled
with the installation of screening in a reserve (access restricting) strip
along the rear lot lines of such lots;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops
entered from and generally at right angles to the arterial street, with the
rear lot lines of the lots at the termini of such streets backing onto the
arterial; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip but having access thereto at suitable points.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Dead end streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Temporary stub streets. Streets shall be so arranged to provide
for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire,
medical and police protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where
such continuation comports with the City's Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent
property is undeveloped and the street must dead end temporarily, the right-of-
way shall be extended to the property line, and no strip that would prevent
connections with future streets shall be reserved. A temporary turnabout either
circular or Y-shaped shall be provided at the terminus of any temporary dead-
end street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Permanent dead-end streets. For greater convenience to traffic
and more effective police, medical and fire protection, permanent dead-end
streets shall be limited to 500 feet in length. The terminus of a permanent
dead-end street shall not be closer than 50 feet to the boundary of an adjacent
tract. A cul-de-sac turn-around shall be provided at the end of every permanent
dead-end street as shown in Detail R-5.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Alleys. Alleys shall generally be prohibited in the Residential
District but may be required. Alleys are required in all Business and
Industrial Districts unless other adequate provisions for service access are
made. When required or provided, alleys shall be at least 20-feet-wide and
shall be paved in accordance with this chapter. Alleys normally shall not
intersect with one another nor change sharply in alignment. Adequate vehicular
turnaround space shall be provided at the terminus of any dead-end alley.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Intersections.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Only two streets. Not more than two streets shall intersect at
any one point.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Right angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles; in no case shall two streets intersect at
an angle of less than 75 degrees. An oblique street shall be curved approaching
an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles with said
intersection for at least 100 feet therefrom.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Proper alignment. Proposed new intersections along one side of
an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing
intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline
offsets of less than one 150 feet shall not be permitted except where the
intersected street has divided lanes without median breaks at either
intersection. Intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall be at
least 800 feet apart.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Curb radii. To permit safe vehicular movement at corners, the
minimum curb radius at the intersection of two streets shall be 20 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Flat grade. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade
wherever practical. In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a 2%
slope for a distance of 60 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to an intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Maximum cross slope. The cross slopes on all streets, including
intersections, shall not exceed 3%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Adequate sight lines. Where any street intersection will involve
earth banks or existing vegetation on the triangular area of land bounded by
the intersecting street lines and a line joining the two points along those
street lines that are each 30 feet from the point of intersection, the
developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in
connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent necessary
to provide an adequate sight distance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Reverse curves. A tangent (i.e., straight section) at least 100
feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on collector streets for
better alignment and improved visibility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Improvements to existing streets. Whenever any subdivision abuts an
existing street or street easement that is narrower than the standards
indicated in the Table of Street Design Specifications, the subdivider shall
dedicate sufficient right-of-way on the side of the subdivision to permit
compliance with those standards. The developer shall be responsible for
improving one-half said street to the standards imposed by the city's current
street requirements of this code. The developer shall also pay IDOT, the city
or township (where applicable) for one-half the cost, or costs determined by
said agencies, for required improvements to existing street/easement under
their control, as a result of building the subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â When excess right-of-way required. Right-of-way width in excess of
the standards set forth in the Table of Street Design Specifications shall be
required where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate earth slopes; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Due to the location of railroad tracks, additional width is
needed to construct overpasses and approaches thereto.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Center turn lanes. are prohibited in all residential districts, or
in other business districts that have residences co-mingled. Center turn lanes
shall be constructed as specified in current IDOT standards. The city reserves
the right to approve or not approve all construction, location, and design.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Parking. On-street parking requirements are detailed in the Table
of Street Design Specifications. Off-street parking requirements are contained
in the city zoning code.

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be required:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â On both sides of a local street, when residential density is two or
more dwelling units per net acre; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Along both sides of streets, near schools, and in shopping areas
and similar public places. These requirements shall not be waived unless the
Plan Commission advises the City Council that, in the area in question,
sidewalks are not needed to ensure public safety, and/or that topographical
conditions make the installation of sidewalks impractical.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Construction standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Relationship to curb. Sidewalks shall be located as shown on the
corresponding street classification detail.

(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0320 LANDSCAPING.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Planting requirements. All planting strips within the public right-of-
way shall be graded and landscaped in such a manner as to meet the approval of
the City Council. In general, such landscaping shall include the use of various
tree species, including American or English Elm, American or European Linden,
Hard Maple, Pin Oak, Red Oak, Sycamore, or other species as approved by the
City Council. Such trees shall be spaced not more than 100 feet apart, no
closer than 30 feet from a street intersection, and shall be placed an adequate
distance from sidewalks, curb and guttering, and streets to eliminate the
possibility of root damage.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Landscape berms. Whenever the back or side yards of a residential
development face non-subdivision streets, a landscape berm is required. A
landscape plan for the required berm shall be submitted for review and approval
by the Chief Building and Zoning Official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Required berms. A minimum 30-foot-wide natural landscape buffer, a
minimum of four feet in height with a maximum slope of three to one (to include
a berm that will provide visual protection to the property owner from the
roadway) is required whenever the back or side yards of a residential
development face non-subdivision streets or whenever a landscape berm is
otherwise required on the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Location. Areas consisting of berms, evergreens, and other
landscaping, which act as a buffer between the development and major
thoroughfares, shall be located in a landscaping easement that will be
maintained by the adjacent property owner, or on outlots to be maintained by a
Homeowner's Association. Berms shall not be placed over utilities. Fences will
not be allowed in landscape easements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Maintenance. Required landscape berms shall be placed in common
ground for permanent maintenance, or if otherwise approved by the City Council,
may be part of any lot, the buffer shall be subject to a permanent maintenance
easement acceptable to the city and shall not be counted in the calculation of
minimum lot size required by the applicable zoning. Such easements shall be
deed restricted to prevent adjacent property owners from constructing any
facilities or structures (including fences) on a berm or easement.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0321 STREETLIGHTS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Required locations. Streetlights shall be provided at each
intersection of streets (or alleys) within a subdivision and at each cul-de-
sac, but in no event shall there be less than one streetlight per 400 feet (or
portion thereof) of street frontage between intersections, or between a street
intersection and the terminus of a dead-end street. Additionally, in multi-
family dwelling developments, lighting shall be provided within parking areas
at a minimum rate of one light per 25 parking spaces or any fraction thereof.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Streetlight system standards. The design and installation of the
streetlight system in every subdivision shall be reviewed by the Plan
Commission, Code Enforcement Officer, Public Works Supervisor, and the
appropriate electric utility company. The lighting intensity of each
streetlight shall be equivalent, at a minimum, to a 175-watt lamp or 6800
mercury luminaire lamp. Each streetlight standard (post) shall be at least 16
feet high.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0322 STREET NAME SIGNS.
Â Â Â Street name signs of the size, height, and type approved by the City Council
shall be purchased by the city and placed at all intersections within or
abutting any subdivision with the developer reimbursing the city for all
expenses incurred. Street names shall be sufficiently different in sound and
spelling from other street names in the city so as to avoid confusion. A street
which is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same
name. The City Council reserves the right to approve and/or disapprove all
street names.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0323 UTILITIES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All utility lines shall be located underground throughout all
subdivisions in all zoning districts, in such a manner that the various service
lines can be logically extended to adjacent areas and that such underground
services do not adversely affect one another. Generally, gas, electric,
telephone and CATV utility lines shall be buried a minimum of one foot below
the finished grade, while water and sewer utility lines shall be a minimum of
three feet. In addition, any support equipment required to be above ground
(e.g. transformer boxes, vaults, wiring pedestals, etc.) shall be located in a
safe and sightly manner.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â To enhance the appearance of a lot for a homeowner, support equipment
shall wherever possible be located on the rear (back yard) lot lines provided
easement and access for the utility maintainer is provided. No utility line
shall be placed such that it runs parallel within the area bordered by vertical
planes located one foot inside and outside the curb and gutter lines.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Underground service connections to the property line of each platted
lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense; provided that, on the
recommendation of the City Plan Commission, the requirement for service
connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be
retained in single ownership.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Utility easements. Easements shall be provided for public and
private utilities. Front yard easements for city water and sewer placement are
preferred and shall be 20-feet-wide. Rear and side yard easements are permitted
depending on conditions and shall be 20-feet-wide and centered on abutting lot
lines. Subdividers/developers shall be mindful that placement of driveways,
sidewalks, parking lots, etc., over city provided utilities, even with written
easements, requires owners or future owners to bear the cost of all replacement
(similar or like) surface material in the event of repair or replacement. Full
determination of precise location and minimum width shall be made by the Code
Enforcement Officer or Public Works Supervisor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Excavation backfill. The trench width for installation of all water
and sewer lines shall be a maximum of one and one-half foot greater than the
outside diameter of the pipe being placed. Pipe shall be placed on bedding
material free of stones, frozen clods, or other materials likely to cause
damage to the pipe material. The initial lift of backfill shall be select
material free of stones, frozen clods, or other materials likely to cause
damage to the pipe, placed such that uniform support of the pipe haunches is
obtained and to a depth of one-half diameter of the pipe. The next lift of
backfill material shall again be select material free of stones, frozen clods,
or other materials likely to cause damage to the pipe, placed for a minimum
compacted depth of six inches above the top of the pipe. The remaining backfill
shall be placed in compacted layers of approximately six-inch lifts.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Water or sewer lines which fall within the area bounded by an
imaginary vertical plan located one foot outside the curb and gutter lines,
shall be backfilled with sand placed in six-inch compacted lifts to a depth of
18 inches below the finished grade. Should the line cross beneath the curb and
gutter or fall in the roadway, the least 18 inches of backfill shall consist of
CA-6 or CA-7 gradation crushed stone in accordance with the current edition of
the Illinois Department of Transportation's "Standard Specifications for Road
and Bridge Construction." Other areas may be backfilled with select earthen
material. Water and sewer lines consisting of non-ferrous pipe materials shall
require placing detector wires or tape such that the location of the line may
be found using available metal detecting equipment.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0324 WATER FACILITIES.
Â Â Â An adequate supply of potable water shall be provided to every platted lot
in accordance with Illinois Department of Public Health regulations.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â If the public water system is reasonably accessible, each lot shall be
properly connected thereto at the property line.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If the public water system is not within 2,000 feet of the
development, individual wells may be used or a private central water system may
be developed, provided the Code Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor
approve such facilities. All water distribution lines shall be at least six
inches in diameter, larger size may be required as determined by the Code
Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor; also, valves shall be so
located that not more than 800 feet of water main shall be put out of service
at any time.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants of the type approved by the City Fire
Chief and Commissioner of Public Works shall be installed in every subdivision
as part of the water distribution system. Unless otherwise stated, fire
hydrants shall have at least a five inch barrel, be equipped with two
connections for two and one-half inch hose and one four inch fire truck/pumper
connection and have a separate shut-off valve and box of at least six inches in
nominal size. Fire hydrants shall be installed throughout the subdivision at
intervals of 400 feet or less.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0325 SANITARY SEWERS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All proposed sanitary sewer facilities shall comply with the
regulations of the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency and must be approved by the Code Enforcement
Officer and Public Works Supervisor. Sanitary sewers shall be televised prior
to any private lateral connection and being accepted by the city. Videos of
televised inspection will be provided to the city for their records.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When public system available. Whenever the public sanitary sewerage
system is reasonably accessible, the developer shall extend said system
throughout the subdivision and shall provide each lot with a connection
thereto. Sewers shall be installed at reasonable depths. Basements shall not be
served by gravity; individual sewage ejector pumps shall be used to provide
sanitary sewer service to basements. Systems requiring the installation of a
lift station must be furnished with a station meeting the approval of the city.
Occasionally the city may require the subdivider to install a system with a
capacity greater than the needs of the individual subdivision. In these
instances, the city may participate in the additional costs involved with
increasing the capacity of the system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When public system unavailable. Land within the subdivision
jurisdiction of the city where the public sanitary sewerage system is not
reasonably accessible, the developer shall provide sanitary sewers in
accordance with such plans and temporarily cap them. To serve the subdivision
until the time when connection to the public system becomes practicable, an
approved private central sewage disposal system shall be installed or, in the
case of subdivisions containing not more than ten lots, individual sewage
disposal systems may be used.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Individual disposal systems. Individual sewage disposal facilities,
such as septic tanks, shall not be installed in any subdivision containing more
than ten lots as shown on the final plat or as subsequently developed. Where
individual disposal facilities are permitted, the Plan Commission in
coordination with the Commissioner of Public Works,
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The City's Code Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor may
require that the minimum lot size be increased as necessary, above usual zoning
district requirements. Evidence of the approval of the proposed individual
system by the Illinois Department of Public Health or satisfactory test reports
for the particular system shall be furnished to the Chief Building and Zoning
Official upon request.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0326 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The City Plan Commission shall not recommend the approval of any plat
unless, after consultation with the Code Enforcement Officer and Public Works
Supervisor, they determine that the proposed provisions for stormwater drainage
are adequate. Drainage improvements in the subdivision shall be coordinated
with existing and planned drainage improvements elsewhere so as to form an
integrated city system. Stormwater detention shall be required and shall be
separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The plans and specifications for the disposing of stormwater and the
construction thereof shall be subject to the approval of the Commissioner of
Public Works and the City's Code Enforcement Officer and Public Works
Supervisor. The design of the entire stormwater drainage system shall be in
accordance with most current IDOT "Bureau of Local Road and Streets
Administrative Policies" and the IDOT "Drainage Manual."
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Pipe culverts and other systems to convey flow for ditches, streams,
etc., shall be designed for at least the 25-year storm. Pavement drainage
systems shall be designed for at least the ten-year storm. The entire
subdivision shall be analyzed for the effects of the 100-year storm to assure
that buildings are properly elevated above the floods occurring beyond the
design capabilities of the stormwater structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Sump pump drainage. Subdividers/developers shall design and install
a central drainage backbone of sufficient size, and shall provide and install
at each building, at least a three inch access to the central drainage backbone
for basement sump pump. The central backbone shall be connected into the storm
sewer at necessary intervals throughout the subdivision to handle all water
flow.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Inlets and catch basins. Inlets, where required, shall be
constructed to Illinois Department of Transportation specifications unless
otherwise approved by the City Council, so that surface water is not carried
across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 400 feet in
the gutter. The use of catch basins shall be permitted/required by the Code
Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor in locations where the slope of
the stormwater drainage system is deemed inadequate in terms of generating a
flow velocity capable of transporting debris and other matter through the
system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or drainage
facility large enough to accommodate potential runoff from the entire drainage
area upstream from the proposed subdivision shall be provided in accordance
with the City's Code Enforcement Officer and/or Public Works Supervisor's
specifications. Potential runoff shall be determined on the basis of the
maximum development of the upstream area that is permitted under the zoning
district regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Effect on downstream areas. The Code Enforcement Officer and Public
Works Supervisor shall also consider the effect of any proposed subdivision or
downstream areas. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident
to development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the City Council shall require the developer to install additional
drainage improvements to alleviate the overload problem.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Partial compensation for oversize improvements. The City Council,
with the assistance of the City Attorney, may make satisfactory arrangements to
compensate the developer for any portion of the cost of oversize drainage
improvements that is not attributable solely to the subdivision in question.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Areas subject to flooding. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
that is subject to flooding, the City Council may require appropriate
protective measures, including the filling of the flood prone area to a level
above the regulatory flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Drainage easements. Adequate easements for stormwater drainage
shall be established along any natural drainage channel and in any other
locations where necessary to provide satisfactory disposal of stormwater from
streets, alleys, and all other portions of the subdivision. The precise
location and minimum widths of said easements shall be determined by the Code
Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0327 TEMPORARY EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â No subdivision or development disturbing land of more than 5,000
square feet, shall be approved by the city without a written Erosion & Sediment
Control Plan (text) and a graphical depiction of erosion control measures for
the activity being undertaken. Both of the aforementioned shall be inserted as
sheets in the improvement plans. The city is applying typical NPDES
requirements for one acre area to said 5,000 square feet areas (minimum) and
larger areas. The Erosion & Sediment Control Plan shall include example text
described in the Municipal Standard Details, including the NPDES Permit Number
and Certification by the developer's engineer directly on the plans or utilize
current IDOT verbiage directly on the plans as opposed to separate documents to
facilitate review in the field.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The developer shall initiate and complete improvements such that the
smallest increments of disturbed earth result. Temporary seeding and mulch
shall be used in accordance with IDOT requirements. The IDOT Bureau of Design
and Environment Manual which references the Illinois Urban Manual, provides
guidelines for the number of temporary ditch checks, inlet and pipe protection,
and other temporary erosion and sediment controls.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Temporary vegetation or, where appropriate, mulching, or other non-
viable cover shall be used to protect areas exposed during development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Adequate provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions both during and
after development. Appropriate devices, such as sediment basins, debris basins,
desilting basins, or silt traps, shall be installed and maintained to remove
sediment from surface waters leaving the development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No development shall be occupied until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Grading has been completed in accordance with the approved final
plat and plans; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â At least four inches of topsoil equal in quality to the soil
that was on site prior to development has been spread over each residential
lot.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0328 DEDICATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The City Council may require the developer to dedicate (i.e.,
transfer without compensation) to the city or other appropriate governmental
entity suitable parcel(s) of land within the subdivision for parks,
playgrounds, schools, bikeways, access ways to these facilities, or other
public purposes provided the need for such facilities is uniquely and
specifically attributable to said subdivision and the requirement is in
conformance with the City Comprehensive Plan. Any such dedicated area shall be
shown on the final plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a parcel of land suitable for such purposes is not available
within the subdivision, the City Council may require that, as a condition for
final plat approval, the developer deposit funds with the city to acquire or
improve recreational or educational facilities that are/will be located in the
vicinity of the subdivision and available and beneficial to the residents
thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The amount of the required deposit shall not exceed that portion of
the cost of such acquisition/improvement which is uniquely and specifically
attributable to the subdivision.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Access. Access and connections to parks, playgrounds, schools,
bikeways, or other public facilities are to be provided by way of open access
ways between private land and/or from public right-of-way. The access ways
should be a minimum of 30 feet.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0329 RESERVATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â At the sole discretion of the City Council, instead of requiring the
developer to dedicate parcels, the City Council may require that the developer
reserve land for parks, playgrounds, schools, or other public purposes in
locations designated in the City's Comprehensive Plan. Since public acquisition
of reserved land requires compensation, it is not essential that the need for
such land be uniquely and specifically attributable to the subdivision (see 65
ILCS 5/11-12-8).
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city or other appropriate governmental entity must take action to
purchase or condemn any land reserved for public purposes within 12 months from
the date of final plat approval. Failure to initiate such action within the
prescribed time limit shall result in removal of the reservation and the
consequent freeing of the property for other permitted development.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0330 PHASED DEVELOPMENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â When a developer is undertaking phased development of a tract or
multiple tracts, the entire tract(s) must be depicted via the preliminary plat
and improvement plans with all required calculations and submittals for all
proposed improvements for the entire tract. This is to ensure that the proposed
infrastructure is planned comprehensively for as large an area as possible,
i.e. sanitary sewer mains and lift stations, detention systems, etc. The
preliminary plat and improvement plans shall have that section being
constructed, coinciding with the section shown on the final plat, clearly
delineated.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The final plat, or plats, shall coincide with the phase of the
improvement plans being constructed and shall not show, as part of the platted
boundary, future lots and development associated with future improvements
within the entire tract.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Special attention is called to drainage systems, including detention
and retention facilities. The area of the detention or retention facility
associated with the improvements for the entire tract(s) and not just those
being platted shall be included in the platted boundary of review. The
detention or retention facility outlet systems shall be designed to detain only
the pre- development discharges associated with the areas being platted though
the reservation of surface area and volume shall be designed for the entire

complete the required improvements, and to return the balance (if any) of such
funds to the subdivider/developer; or
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Require the subdivider/developer to submit a new performance bond,
escrow deposit, or cash sum sufficient to guarantee the completion of the
improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans after recalculation in
order to allow for any inflated costs of constructing the required
improvements.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0351 OTHER REMEDIES FOR DEFAULT.
Â Â Â If the developer or surety fails to comply with the requirements for payment
as described above or fails to complete the improvements as required, and there
is risk that development will continue in the subdivision without timely prior
completion of improvements, the City Council may, in addition or alternatively
to other remedies:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Suspend the right of anyone to build or construct on the undeveloped
portion of the subdivision. For the purposes of this subsection, the
"undeveloped portion" of the subdivision means all lots other than lots which
have been sold for personal use and occupancy or are under bona fide contract
for sale to any person for personal use or occupancy. The Commissioner of
Public Works ("Commissioner"), at the direction of the City Council, shall give
the developer ten days' written notice of an order under this section, with
copies to all sureties, as appropriate, who may have outstanding obligations
for any undeveloped portion of the subdivision, and shall record an affidavit
of such notice with the Recorder of Deeds. If, within the ten-day period after
notice is given, the City Council is not convinced by compelling evidence that
completion of the improvements is adequately assured, as provided herein, the
Commissioner shall order construction suspended on the undeveloped portion of
the subdivision. The order shall be served upon the developer, with a copy to
the issuer of the surety as appropriate, and a copy recorded with the Recorder
of Deeds. Public notice of said order shall be conspicuously and prominently
posted by the Commissioner at the subdivisions or lots subject to said order.
The notice shall contain the following minimum language, which may be
supplemented at the direction of the Commissioner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If said notice is for a subdivision:
THIS SUBDIVISION, (name of subdivision), HAS BEEN DECLARED IN DEFAULT BY THE
CITY OF GREENVILLE CITY COUNCIL. NO DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, OR BUILDING IN
ANY MANNER SHALL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS SUBDIVISION UNTIL SUCH
TIME AS THE CITY OF GREENVILLE CITY COUNCIL REMOVES THIS PROHIBITION. ANY
DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, OR BUILDING IN ANY MANNER WHILE THIS PROHIBITION IS
IN EFFECT IS ILLEGAL AND SHALL BE ENFORCED PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF GREENVILLE
REVISED ORDINANCES.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If said notice is for a lot:
THIS LOT, (lot number), HAS BEEN DECLARED IN DEFAULT BY THE CITY OF GREENVILLE
CITY COUNCIL. NO DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, OR BUILDING IN ANY MANNER SHALL
TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS LOT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE CITY OF
GREENVILLE CITY COUNCIL REMOVES THIS PROHIBITION. ANY DEVELOPMENT,
CONSTRUCTION, OR BUILDING IN ANY MANNER WHILE THIS PROHIBITION IS IN EFFECT IS
ILLEGAL AND SHALL BE ENFORCED PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF GREENVILLE REVISED
ORDINANCES.
The suspension shall be rescinded in whole or in part only: (1) when the
Commissioner is convinced that completion of the improvements is adequately
assured; or (2) by action of the City Council.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Suspend the rights of the developer, or any related entity, to
construct structures in any development platted after the effective date of
such suspension throughout the City of Greenville and such incorporated or
unincorporated areas as are under the City of Greenville jurisdiction. The
Commissioner, at the direction of the City Council, shall give the developer
ten days' written notice of an order under this clause, with a copy to sureties
known to the Commissioner to have obligations outstanding on behalf of the
developer or related entities and shall record an affidavit of such notice with
the Recorder of Deeds. If, within the ten-day period after notice is given, the
City Council is not convinced by compelling evidence that completion of the
improvements is adequately assured, as provided herein, the Commissioner shall
order construction suspended. The order shall be served upon the developer,
with a copy to the surety as appropriate, and a copy recorded with the Recorder
of Deeds. The suspension shall be rescinded in whole or in part only: (1) when
the Commissioner is convinced that completion of the improvements is adequately
assured; or (2) by action of the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For purposes of this section, a developer is a "related entity" of
another person if: (1) either has a principal or controlling interest in the
other; or (2) any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, or other
entity with a controlling interest in one has a principal or controlling
interest in the other.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In addition, if any party fails to comply with any obligation of
this section, the City Council may recommend that the City Attorney take
appropriate legal action and may also withhold any building, or occupancy
permits to this developer or related entities until such compliance is cured.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The city shall also have the right to partially or wholly remedy a
developer's deficiencies or breached obligations under this code by set-off of
any funds or assets otherwise held by the City of Greenville to the maximum
extent permitted by law. Such set-off shall occur upon written notice of such
event by the City Council to the developer after the developer has failed to
timely cure the deficiencies. It shall be deemed a provision of every final
plat approval under this code that the developer shall pay the city's costs,
including reasonable attorney's fees, of enforcement of any provision herein.

which, if strictly applied, would cause great practical difficulties or
hardship. The Chief Building and Zoning Official shall review the request and
determine if the variance application is a platting or planning issue for the
Plan Commission for review as outlined below, or a post-improvement plan issue
for the Zoning Hearing Officer to be processed as detailed herein., then
appropriately forward for action.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Action by the Plan Commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â After review of the application, the Plan Commission shall hold a
public hearing on every variance request within a reasonable time after said
request is submitted to them. Notice indicating the time, date and place of the
hearing, and the nature of the variance shall be given not more than 30 nor
less than 15 days before the hearing by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation within the city. Said notice shall also be sent by first class mail
to the applicant, and owners of property adjacent to the property in question
at the time the public notice is published. At the hearing, any interested
party may appear and testify, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or
attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within 15 days after the hearing, the Plan Commission shall submit
an advisory report of their recommendation(s), along with their recommendation
on preliminary plat approval. Before the actions in this chapter, the Code
Enforcement Officer and Public Works Supervisor shall add their comments to the
advisory report as necessary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All actions of the Plan Commission shall be documented in official
minutes.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Action by the City Council, variance standards. Preferably, at the
same meeting at which the Council takes action on the application for
preliminary plat approval, the City Council shall consider the recommendations
of all reviewers of the application and shall determine by vote whether to
grant or deny the requested variance. A copy of the Council decision clearly
stating the reasons therefor, and the exact terms of any variance granted,
shall be attached to both the preliminary and final plat. The City Council
shall not grant any subdivision variance unless, based upon the information
presented to them, they determine that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Strict application of the subdivision requirements would result in
great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, not a mere
inconvenience;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
their own making;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other tracts and, therefore, that a variance would be a more
appropriate remedy than an ordinance amendment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The variance, if granted, will not materially frustrate
implementation of the Comprehensive Plan including the Official Map.

(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
ARTICLE XIII: STORMWATER DETENTION
Â§ 153.0381 GENERAL PURPOSE.
Â Â Â Stormwater runoff and velocity of discharge are increased through
development and growth of the city. Prior to the development of land, highly
permeable surfaces absorb most rainfall and the stormwater that runs off does
so very slowly. With the construction of streets, homes, buildings, etc., both
the percentage of runoff and the velocity of runoff increase significantly.
These increases can cause damaging effects on both private properties and
public facilities with substantial costs to individuals and taxpayers. To
minimize these effects these stormwater detention requirements have been
established to:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Prevent additional harm due to periodic flooding including bodily
injury.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Property damage, and threats to public health, safety, and welfare.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Assure that new development does not increase flood and drainage
hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Create no new financial burden on the taxpayer for flood control
projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and for
flood rescue and relief operations.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Protect buildings and improvements to buildings from flood damage to
the greatest extent possible.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Conserve the natural hydrologic, hydraulic, water quality and other
beneficial functions of flood prone areas, regulatory floodplains, and
wetlands.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Prevent additional disruption of the economy and governmental services
due to stormwater and flood damage.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0382 WHEN STORMWATER DETENTION IS REQUIRED.
Â Â Â Stormwater detention will be required for all public and private
developments that meet all of the following criteria:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Has a gross area in excess of one acre. If the area to be developed is
one acre or less, and either the property owner or developer has any legal
rights (subject to the interpretation of the City Attorney) to contiguous land,
the area of that contiguous land is to be included in the "gross area."
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Where the post development runoff for the immediate area to be
developed is increased by more than 20% over the predevelopment runoff using a
50-year design frequency and ultimate development of the immediate area. The
20% figure is only the criteria to determine the need for stormwater detention
and has nothing to do with the volume to be detained.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0383 EXCEPTIONS.
Â Â Â Stormwater facilities shall not be required if:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All requirements for detention are not met.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If two or more property owners and/or developers within the same
drainage basin propose to build one stormwater detention facility to reduce the
number of on- site detention facilities that might be required. A written
agreement would have to be reached with the city to guarantee construction of
the detention facility.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If the owner and/or developer pays a fee to the city in lieu of
building the detention facilities, the amount of the fee would be based on a
registered professional engineer's estimate of the cost to build on site
detention facilities plus the cost of engineering and the required land. This
exception would be subject to approval and possible special conditions by the
city. This type of agreement would allow the city to coordinate construction of
central detention facilities that would serve more than one development within
the same drainage basin.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â If it can be shown by detailed stormwater calculations, including
hydrographs, that a detention facility is not warranted. Such an analysis would
have to show that the increased runoff from a proposed development would have
no detrimental effect on upstream facilities, the proposed development,
existing downstream facilities, or future downstream developments, including
those outside the jurisdiction of the city.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0384 DESIGN CRITERIA.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The design of stormwater detention facilities shall be based on
the procedures outlined in the Drainage Manual of the Illinois Department of
Transportation. If there is any conflict with city provisions, the city
provisions shall take precedence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The detention facilities shall be designed to accommodate the
existing and potential runoff from the proposed development and all upstream
areas that drain through the development. Runoff shall be calculated on the
basis of ultimate development of the entire watershed in accordance with
present land use trends. See possible "exceptions" in the above section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The stormwater detention facility will be required to detain the
runoff from both a ten-year and a 50-year storm frequency. The maximum
discharge flows are to be no greater than the pre-development flows for the ten
and 50-year storms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â For earthen detention basins the maximum side slopes shall not
exceed one foot vertical to three feet horizontal. A three foot concrete swale
shall be constructed in the flow line to facilitate future maintenance.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The entire reservoir area shall be sloped to drain to the outlet
so that water will not stand during no flow periods. The entire area shall be
seeded, fertilized, and mulched, or sodded, or paved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The developer shall conform to all provisions of the Standard
Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, as published by the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and shall detail all provisions to be
utilized to prevent soil erosion and accomplish sediment control during
construction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Each outlet not intercepted by an existing closed system with flow
velocities greater than four feet per second, as calculated at the appropriate
design frequency, shall be a concrete or rip-rapped area downstream of the
outlet, the length in feet being three times the outlet velocity in feet per
second and the width equal to that of the outlet and extending up the ditch
backslopes to a point one foot above the water surface and surrounding the
outlet structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â An overflow spillway will be provided at the elevation of the
maximum water surface for the 50-year storm frequency. The berms shall be
constructed at least one-half foot above the spillway elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The minimum design requirements of this section shall not be
construed to relieve the subdivider of any legal responsibilities for
downstream/upstream stormwater damages inflicted by runoff or backup from the
developer.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0385 EASEMENTS.
Â Â Â All stormwater detention facilities, including inlet and outlet ditches and
structures, shall be encompassed by permanent easements that extend to at least
ten feet outside of the inside top of berm. A ten-foot minimum easements shall
also be provided for access between the detention facility and a public
roadway.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0386 SUBMITTALS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The developer shall be responsible for providing the following
information to the city for review and approval:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Plans showing all existing and proposed elevations and grades for
culverts, ditches, inlets, etc. Any existing topography of adjoining properties
which will affect or be affected by the development shall also be identified on
the plan documents.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All design calculations utilized in sizing the stormwater
facilities including the hydraulic grade line elevation at all structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Detention calculations detailing total drainage area and breakdown
of land usages, time of concentration, existing peak discharges for each design
storm, existing and proposed runoff coefficients, and total required detention
volume.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Location of proposed detention facilities detailing limits of
ponding for each design storm and total available volume, and details of outlet
structure(s).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Calculations indicating the effects of a 100-year storm frequency
on the development and adjoining developments. The developer may be required to
provide emergency flood control devices to ensure the safety of the existing
and proposed structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Outlet flows and velocities at the appropriate storm frequencies
shall be clearly noted either in calculations or on the plans to facilitate
determination of detention storage and/or erosion control requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Pre- and post-development runoff at 50-year and ten-year storm
frequencies for the entire development area shall be noted either in
calculations or on the plans.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city, on a case-by-case basis, shall have the authority to require
additional information for a proper review, require more stringent standards
than these detailed in this section, and to grant variations form those
requirements in this section which may not apply.
(Ord. 3354, passed 4-8-2025)
Â§ 153.0387 MAINTENANCE.
Â Â Â Detention facilities are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer
installation and/or grading. Since these facilities are intended to control
increased runoff, they must be fully operational soon after the clearing of the
vegetation. Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed
periodically from the detention area and control structures in order to
maintain full storage capacity. The responsibility for maintenance of the
detention facilities in development projects shall remain with the owner until
such time as the city makes a final inspection of the entire development and
officially approves all of the construction in writing, and the detention area/
facilities are dedicated to the city and accepted by the City Council.

Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Decommissioning plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owner or operator of the SES shall completely decommission
within 12 months for any reason stated in this section or if any of the
following conditions (â€œdecommissioning triggersâ€) exists:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The SES ceases to generate electricity for a continuous period
of 12 consecutive months;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The land lease ends, expires or is terminated;

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The City of Greenville Zoning Administrator shall notify the
applicant, owner, or operator to remove the system. This period may be extended
by the Zoning Administrator if the owner or operator provides evidence within
45 days that the failure to generate electricity is due to circumstances beyond
the owner's or operator's reasonable control and has not been abandoned.
Decommissioning shall include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The removal of all equipment, cables, wires, conduits,
structures, fencing and foundations to a depth of at least 48 inches below
grade. All solid wastes and hazardous materials related to the construction,

writing by the owner of the real estate to not revegetate due to plans for
agricultural planting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â To ensure the full completion of decommissioning requirements, and/
or to facilitate the mitigating and abatement of public nuisances or health
hazards caused by debris or hazardous materials occurring in the event of
partial or complete destruction by natural or man-made causes, the owner and/or
operator shall obtain and deliver to the City of Greenville a performance bond
or similar financial assurance, for removal of all components (â€œDecommissioning
Securityâ€). Any such bond must be issued for a term of at least seven years and
must not be cancelable during that term. The plan shall state that in form and
substance, reasonably satisfactory to the city securing the owner and/or
operator obligation, the city shall have access to the project and to the funds
to affect or complete decommissioning if the applicant, owner or operator fails
to complete removal and decommissioning of the SFES strictly according to the
terms of the decommissioning plan within 45 days of notice from the City Zoning
Administrator or by such additional time granted by the City Zoning
Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The Decommissioning security shall be equal to 110% of the
estimated cost of decommissioning. The decommissioning security shall survive
the bankruptcy or dissolution of the owner and/or operator or other termination
of the owner and/or operator of the SES existence or its legal obligations.
Once it is in place, the owner and/or operator shall maintain the
decommissioning security and cause the decommissioning security to be valid and
enforceable until the secured decommissioning obligations are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The applicant shall provide the City of Greenville Zoning
Administrator with a new estimate of the cost of decommissioning the SFES every
five years, due on the anniversary of the special use being granted. Failure to
provide a new estimate and/or acceptable financial plan estimate shall be
considered a cessation of operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â When any of the identified decommissioning triggers exist, if
the owner and/or operator has not complied with its decommissioning and related
obligations. The City shall be entitled to make a claim against the
decommissioning security for its costs to decommission, net of any salvage
value the city actually realizes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The applicant and/or owners of SFES shall pay all costs
associated with the remedy of any complaints deemed necessary and factual by
the Zoning Administrator. SFES shall conform to all applicable industry
standards, including those from the UL and Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and, when applicable, all SFES shall conform to any applicable Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) study.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Greenville from seeking
such other legal or equitable remedies available to prevent or remedy any
violation of this section.
