provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the
party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes

implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as abating any
action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the village
herein repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this
code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the
same provision; nor shall this chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying, or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
village under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this code.

   (C)   Duties of members.
      (1)   While the presiding officer is putting the question, no member
shall walk across or out of the Board Chamber.
      (2)   (a)   Every member, prior to his or her speaking, making a motion
or seconding the same shall not proceed with his or her remarks until
recognized and named by the Chair.
         (b)   He or she shall confine himself or herself to the question under
debate, avoiding personalities and refraining from impugning the motives of any
other Trustee’s argument or vote.
   (D)   Visitors. No person other than a member of the Board of Trustees shall
address that body on the same question unless such person has been recognized
by the presiding officer.
   (E)   Debate.
      (1)   No Trustee shall speak more than once on the same question, except
by consent of the presiding officer or unless three-fourths of the corporate
authorities agree that one’s right to debate should be limited to speak only
once, and then not until every other Trustee desiring to speak shall have had
an opportunity to do so; provided, however, that the proponent of the matter
under consideration, as the case may be, shall have the right to open and close
debate.
      (2)   No Trustee shall speak longer than ten minutes at any one time,
except by consent of the Board of Trustees; and in closing debate on any
question as provided above, the speaker shall be limited to five minutes,
except by special consent of the Board of Trustees.
      (3)   The Board of Trustees, by motion, may limit debate. The presiding
officer shall have the right to participate in debate. While a member is
speaking, no Trustee shall hold any private discussion, nor pass between the
speaker and the Chair.
   (F)   Call of Trustees to order. A Trustee, when called to order by the
Chair, shall thereupon discontinue speaking and take his or her seat and the
order or ruling of the Chair shall be binding and conclusive, subject only to
the right to appeal.
   (G)   Appeals from decision of the Chair.
      (1)   Any Trustee may appeal to the Board of Trustees from a ruling of
the Chair, and if the appeal is seconded, the Trustee making the appeal may

his or her ruling; but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other
person shall participate in the discussion. The presiding officer shall have
the right to participate in debate.

decision of the Chair shall be overruled; otherwise, it shall be sustained.
   (H)   Question of personal privilege. The right of a member to address the
Board of Trustees on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases
in which his or her integrity, character, or motives are assailed, questioned,
or impugned.
   (I)   Voting. Every other member who shall be present when a question is
stated from the Chair shall vote thereon, unless he or she is personally
interested in the question, in which case, he or she shall take whatever steps
are necessary to ensure that his or her vote is not taken.
   (J)   Special order of business. Any matter before the Board of Trustees may
be set down as a special order of business at a time certain if two-thirds of
the Trustees present vote in the affirmative, but not otherwise.
   (K)   Seconding of motions required; written motions. No motion shall be put
or debated in the meeting or in committee unless it be seconded. When a motion
is seconded, it shall be stated by the presiding officer before debate, and

reduced to writing if required by a member, and the proposer of the motion
shall be entitled to the floor.
   (L)   Division of questions. If any question under consideration contains
several distinct propositions, the Board of Trustees, by a majority vote of the
Trustees present may divide such question.
   (M)   Record of motions. In all cases where a resolution or motion is
entered in the journal, the name of the Trustee moving the same shall be
entered also.
   (N)   Announcement and changes of vote. The result of all votes by yeas and
nays shall not be announced by the Village Clerk, but shall be handed by him or
her to the Chair for announcement, and no vote shall be changed after the tally
list has passed from the hands of the Village Clerk.
   (O)   Precedence of motions.
      (1)   When a question is under debate, the following motions shall be in
order and shall have precedence over each other in order, as listed:

decided without debate.
   (P)   Motions to adjourn.
      (1)   A motion to adjourn the village shall always be in order, except:
         (a)   When a Trustee is in possession of the floor;
         (b)   While the yeas and nays are being called;
         (c)   When the members are voting;
         (d)   When adjournment was the last preceding motion; or
         (e)   When it has been decided that the previous question shall be
taken.
      (2)   A motion simply to adjourn shall not be subject to amendment or
debate, but a motion to adjourn to a time certain shall be.
      (3)   The Board of Trustees may, at any time, adjourn over one or more
regular meetings on a vote of a majority of all the Board of Trustees
authorized by law to be elected.
   (Q)   Previous question. When the previous question is moved on the main
question and seconded, it shall be put on this form: “Shall the main question
now be put?” If such motion be carried, all further amendments and all further
motions and debate shall be excluded, and the question put without delay upon
the pending amendment in proper order and then upon the main question.
   (R)   Motions to lay on the table and to take from the table. A motion
simply to lay the question on the table shall not be debatable, but a motion to
lay on the table and publish, or with any other condition, shall be subject to
amendment and debate.
      (1)   A motion to take any motion or other proposition from the table may
be proposed at the same meeting at which such motion or proposition was laid
upon the table; provided two-thirds of the Trustees vote therefor.
      (2)   A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the table
shall apply to that motion or proposition only.
      (3)   An amendment to the main question or other pending question may be
laid on the table and neither the main question, nor such other pending
question shall be affected thereby.
   (S)   Indefinite postponement; motion to defer or postpone without any
reference to time. When consideration of a motion or other proposition is
postponed indefinitely, it shall not be again taken up at the same meeting.
      (1)   A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question
to debate.
      (2)   A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall
not be construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered
to be of the same general nature and to possess the same general attributes so
far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to
a time certain.
   (T)   Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall take
precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.
   (U)   Motion to amend. A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but
one to amend an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained.
      (1)   An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order,
but an amendment relating to a different subject shall not be in order.
      (2)   On an amendment to “strike out and insert,” the paragraph to be
amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be
stricken out, then those to be inserted, and finally, the paragraph as it will
stand if so amended shall be read.
      (3)   An amendment to the main question or other pending questions may be
referred to a committee and neither the main question, nor such other pending
question shall be affected thereby.
   (V)   Filling of blanks. When a blank is to be filled and different sums or
times proposed, the question shall be taken first on the least sum or the
longest time.
   (W)   Motion to substitute. A substitute for any original proposition under
debate or for any pending amendment or such proposition may be entertained
notwithstanding that at such time, further amendment is admissible; and if
accepted by the Board of Trustees by a vote shall entirely supersede such
original proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut-off all
amendments appertaining thereto.
   (X)   Reconsideration. A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time
during the same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A
motion for reconsideration having been once made and decided in the negative
shall not be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered. A
motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Trustees who voted on the
prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless otherwise provided
by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received a majority vote in
the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground that a greater
number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage or adoption
of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider may be made and
seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be
reconsidered.
   (Y)   Adoption of Robert’s Rules of Order Revised. The rules of
parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published edition of Robert’s
Rules of Order Revised shall govern the Board of Trustees in all cases to which
they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the special
rules of the Board of Trustees.
   (Z)   Temporary suspension of rules; amendment of rules. These rules may be
temporarily suspended by a vote of two-thirds of the corporate authorities
entitled by law to be elected and shall not be repealed, altered, or amended,
unless by concurrence of two-thirds of all the corporate authorities entitled
by law to be elected.
   (AA)   Censure of trustees; expulsion of trustees. Any Trustee acting or
appearing in a lewd or disgraceful manner, or who uses opprobrious, obscene,
and insulting language to or about any member of the Board of Trustees, or who
does not obey the order of the Chair, shall be, on motion, censured by a
majority vote of the members present, or expelled by a two-thirds vote of all
Trustees elected.

Board of Trustees meeting.

   Related provisions, see 5 ILCS 120/2.02
§ 30.053 ADDRESS BY THE PUBLIC.
    Any person may address the Board of Trustees with regard to items of
proposed business under the following rules.
   (A)   (1)   At the meeting, once called upon by the Mayor or Trustee having
the floor, he or she shall rise (if not physically impaired) and state his or
her name and address for the record and, unless further time is granted by the
Board, limit remarks to three minutes.
      (2)   All remarks shall be addressed to the Board of Trustees, not to any
member thereof.
   (B)   (1)   No person other than the Trustee recognizing the individual
addressing the Board of Trustees and the person having the floor shall be
permitted to enter into any discussion directly or through a member of the
Board of Trustees without the permission of the Mayor.
      (2)   No questions shall be asked of a Trustee except through the Mayor.
Any person making personal or impertinent remarks or who shall become
disruptive addressing the Board of Trustees shall be forthwith evicted from the
Board of Trustees room by the Mayor.
   (C)   (1)   The Chief of Police or his or her authorized designee shall be
the Sergeant of Arms at the Board of Trustees’ meetings. He or she shall carry
out all orders and instructions of the Mayor for the purposes of maintaining
order and decorum.
      (2)   The Sergeant of Arms shall remove any person violating order or
decorum of the meeting. Such removal may be accompanied by further prosecution
for any violation of any ordinance under this code of ordinances.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-13) (Ord. 11-06, passed 7-18-2011; Ord. 2024-07, passed 8-

§ 30.054 ORDINANCES.
   (A)   (1)   Attorney. It shall be the duty of the Village Attorney to
prepare such ordinances as may be required by the Board of Trustees.
      (2)   Introduced. When a proposed ordinance is introduced, it shall be
read one time by title only and referred to the proper committee, unless the
Board of Trustees shall otherwise specifically direct.
      (3)   Vote required; yeas and nays record. The passage of all ordinances
for whatever purpose, and of any resolution or motion to create any liability
against a village, or for the expenditure or appropriation of its money, shall
require the concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the
Board of Trustees, including the Mayor, unless otherwise expressly provided by
the code of ordinances or any other act governing the passage of any ordinance,
resolution, or motion; provided that, where the Board of Trustees consists of
an odd number of Trustees, the vote of the majority of the Trustees shall be
sufficient to pass an ordinance. The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the
question of the passage of the designated ordinances, resolutions, or motions
and recorded in the journal of the Board of Trustees. In addition, the
corporate authorities at any meeting may by unanimous consent to take a single
vote by yeas or nays on the several questions of the passage on any two or more
of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions, or motions placed together
for voting purposes in a single group. The single vote shall be entered
separately in the journal under the designation “omnibus vote,” and in such
event the Village Clerk may enter the words “omnibus vote” or “consent agenda”
in the journal in each case in lieu of entering names of the members of Board
of Trustees voting “yea” and of those voting “nay” on the passage of each of
the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions, and motions included in such
omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of such single or omnibus vote and
such entries of the words “omnibus vote” or “consent agenda” in the journal
shall be a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this section to all
intents and purposes and with like effect as if the vote in each case had been
separately by yeas and nays on the question of the passage of each ordinance,
order, resolution and motion included in such omnibus group, and separately
recorded in the journal. Likewise, the yeas and nays shall be taken upon the
question of the passage of any other resolution or motion at the request of any
trustee and shall be recorded in the journal.
      (4)   Ordinances; approval; veto.
         (a)   All resolutions and motions:
      1.   Which create any liability against the village;
      2.   Which provide for the expenditure or appropriation of its money; or
      3.   To sell any village property, and all ordinances passed by the Board
of Trustees shall be deposited with the Village Clerk.
         (b)   If the Mayor approves such resolution or motion, the Mayor shall
sign them. Those ordinances, resolutions, and motions which the Mayor
disapproves shall be returned to the Board of Trustees, with his or her written
objections, at the next regular meeting of the Board of Trustees occurring not
less than five days after their passage.
         (c)   The Mayor may disapprove of any one or more sums appropriated in
any ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation, and, if so, the
remainder shall be effective. However, the Mayor may disapprove entirely of an
ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation. If the Mayor fails to
return any ordinance or any specified resolution or motion with his or her
written objections, within the designated time, it shall become effective
despite the absence of the Mayor’s signature.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-14)
   (B)   Every resolution and motion, specified in division (A) above, and
every ordinance, that is returned to the Board of Trustees by the Mayor shall
be reconsidered by the Board of Trustees at the next regular meeting. If, after
reconsideration, two-thirds of all the Trustees then holding office on the
Board of Trustees shall agree at that regular meeting to pass an ordinance,
resolution, or motion, notwithstanding the Mayor’s refusal to approve it, then
it shall be effective. The vote on the question of passage over the Mayor’s
veto shall be by yeas and nays, and shall be recorded in the journal.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-15)
   (C)   No vote of the Board of Trustees shall be reconsidered or rescinded at
a special meeting unless there are present at the special meeting at least as
many Trustees as were present when the vote was taken.

      (1)   No person shall be eligible for any appointive municipal office
unless that person is a qualified elector of the village or otherwise provided
by law.

engineers, health officers, attorneys, or other officers who require technical
training or knowledge, to appointed village treasurers, or to appointed village

OFFICE VACANCIES
§ 30.085 VACANCY BY RESIGNATION.
   A resignation is not effective unless it is in writing, signed by the person
holding the elective office, and notarized.
   (A)   Unconditional resignation. An unconditional resignation by a person
holding the elective office may specify a future date, not later than 60 days
after the date the resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill
the vacancy, at which time it becomes operative, but the resignation may not be
withdrawn after it is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy.
The effective date of a resignation that does not specify a future date at
which it becomes operative is the date the resignation is received by the
officer authorized to fill the vacancy. The effective date of a resignation
that has a specified future effective date is that specified future date or the
date the resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy,
whichever date occurs later.
   (B)   Conditional resignation. A resignation that does not become effective
unless a specified event occurs can be withdrawn at any time prior to the
occurrence of the specified event, but if not withdrawn, the effective date of
the resignation is the date of the occurrence of the specified event or the
date the resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy,
whichever date occurs later.
   (C)   Vacancy upon the effective date. For the purpose of determining the
time period that would require an election to fill the vacancy by resignation
or the commencement of the 60-day time period referred to in §
30.088, the resignation of an elected officer is deemed to have created a
vacancy as of the effective date of the resignation.
   (D)   Duty of the Village Clerk. If a resignation is delivered to the
Village Clerk, the Village Clerk shall forward a certified copy of the written
resignation to the official who is authorized to fill the vacancy within seven
business days after receipt of the resignation.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-37)
§ 30.086 VACANCY BY DEATH, DISABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.
   (A)   Death or disability. A vacancy occurs in an office by reason of the
death of the incumbent. The date of the death may be established by the date
shown on the death certificate. A vacancy occurs in an office by permanent
physical or mental disability rendering the person incapable of performing the
duties of the office. The corporate authorities have the authority to make the
determination whether an officer is incapable of performing the duties of the
office because of a permanent physical or mental disability. A finding of
mental disability shall not be made prior to the appointment by a court of a
guardian ad litem for the officer or until a duly licensed doctor certifies, in
writing, that the officer is mentally impaired to the extent that the officer
is unable to effectively perform the duties of the office. If the corporate
authorities find that an officer is incapable of performing the duties of the
office due to permanent physical or mental disability, that person is removed
from the office and the vacancy of the office occurs on the date of the
determination.
   (B)   Other causes.
      (1)   Abandonment. A vacancy occurs in an office by reason of abandonment
of office, removal from office, or failure to qualify, or more than temporary
removal of residence from the village, as the case may be. The corporate
authorities have the authority to determine whether a vacancy under this
section has occurred. If the corporate authorities determine that a vacancy
exists, the office is deemed vacant as of the date of that determination for
all purposes including the calculation under §§
30.088 and
30.089.
      (2)   Guilty of a criminal offense. An admission of guilt of a criminal
offense that upon conviction would disqualify the municipal officer from
holding the office, in the form of a written agreement with state or federal
prosecutors to plead guilty to a felony, bribery, perjury, or other infamous
crime under state or federal law, constitutes a resignation from that office,
effective on the date the plea agreement is made. For purposes of this section,
a conviction for an offense that disqualifies a municipal officer from holding
that office occurs on the date of the return of a guilty verdict or, in the
case of a trial by the court, on the entry of a finding of guilt.
   (B)   Election declared void. A vacancy occurs on the date of the decision
of a competent tribunal declaring the election of the officer void.
(Prior Code, § 1-2-38)
§ 30.087 ELECTION OF AN ACTING MAYOR.
   (A)   The election of an acting Mayor pursuant to §§
30.089 or
30.090 does not create a vacancy in the original office of the person on the
Board of Trustees, unless the person resigns from the original office following
election as acting Mayor.
   (B)   If the person resigns from the original office following election as
acting Mayor, then the original office must be filled pursuant to the terms of
this section and the acting Mayor shall exercise the powers of the Mayor and
shall vote and have veto power in the manner provided by law for a Mayor. If
the person does not resign from the original office following election as
acting Mayor, then the acting Mayor shall exercise the powers of the Mayor, but
shall be entitled to vote only in the manner provided for as the holder of the
original office and shall not have the power to veto. If the person does not
resign from the original office following election as acting Mayor, and if that
person’s original term of office has not expired when a Mayor is elected and
has qualified for office, the acting Mayor shall return to the original office
for the remainder of the term thereof.

§ 30.088 APPOINTMENT TO FILL TRUSTEE VACANCY.
   (A)   An appointment by the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may be, of a
qualified person as described in §
30.069 to fill a vacancy in the office of a Trustee must be made within 60 days
after the vacancy occurs.
   (B)   Once the appointment of the qualified person has been forwarded to the
corporate authorities, the corporate authorities shall act upon the appointment
within 30 days. If the appointment fails to receive the advice and consent of
the corporate authorities within 30 days, the Mayor or acting Mayor shall
appoint and forward to the corporate authorities a second qualified person as
described in §
30.069.
   (C)   (1)   Once the appointment of the second qualified person has been
forwarded to the corporate authorities, the corporate authorities shall act
upon the appointment within 30 days. If the appointment of the second qualified
person also fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate
authorities, then the Mayor or acting Mayor, without the advice and consent of
the corporate authorities, may make a temporary appointment from those persons
who were appointed, but whose appointments failed to receive the advice and
consent of the corporate authorities.
      (2)   The person receiving the temporary appointment shall serve until an
appointment has received the advice and consent and the appointee has qualified
or until a person has been elected and has qualified, whichever first occurs.

filled by the corporate authorities electing one of their members as acting
Mayor. Except as set forth in §
30.087, the acting Mayor shall perform the duties and possess all the rights
and powers of the Mayor until a Mayor is elected at the next general municipal
election and has qualified.
         (b)   However, in villages with a population of less than 5,000, if
each of the Trustees either declines the election as acting Mayor or is not
elected by a majority vote of the Trustees presently holding office, then the
Board of Trustees may elect as acting Mayor any other village resident who is
qualified to hold municipal office, and the acting Mayor shall exercise the
powers of the Mayor and shall vote and have veto power in the manner provided
by law for a Mayor.
      (2)   Trustee. If the vacancy is in the office of a Trustee, the vacancy
must be filled by the the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may be, in
accordance with §
30.088; and

office other than Mayor or a Trustee, the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case

as the case may be.

those minutes. Minutes of closed sessions shall be kept indefinitely.

provided to anyone unless specifically authorized by vote of the Board of
Trustees.
(Prior Code, § 1-5-7)
   (H)   Procedure for destruction of recordings. The Village Clerk or his or
her designee is hereby authorized to destroy the audio and video recordings of
those closed sessions for which:
      (1)   The corporate authorities of the village have approved the minutes
of the closed sessions as to accurate content, regardless of whether the
minutes have been released for public review;
      (2)   More than 18 months have elapsed since the date of the closed
session;
      (3)   There is no court order requiring the preservation of such
recording; and

§ 30.176 REMOTE MEETING PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   Statutory authority for participation. Pursuant to the Open Meetings
Act, 5 ILCS 120/7, the village does hereby establish a policy that permits
members of the corporate body to attend meetings by means other than physical
presence.
(Prior Code, § 1-5-11)
   (B)   Definition. The term MEETING shall mean any gathering, whether in
person or by video or audio conference, telephone calls, electronic means (such
as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant
messaging), or other means of contemporary interactive communication, of a
majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for the purpose of
discussing public business, or such other definition as shall be contained
within the state statutes.
(Prior Code, § 1-5-12)
   (C)   Amendment to previous terms. The definition of MEETING set forth in
division (B) above shall supersede and replace any other definition used in any
previous or existing ordinance.
(Prior Code, § 1-5-13)
   (D)   Remote participation policy. The village hereby adopts the Remote
Participation Policy, as outlined in this division (D), that permits a member
of the public body to attend and participate in any meeting of a public body as
defined in the Open Meetings Act, being 5 ILCS 120/1.02, from a remote location
via telephone, video, or internet connection; provided that such attendance and
participation is in compliance with the policy and any applicable laws.
      (1)   Policy statement. It is the policy of the village that a member of
any group associated with this unit of government which is subject to the
provisions fo the Open Meetings Act may attend and participate in any open or
closed meeting of that covered group from a remote location via telephone,
video, or internet connection; provided that such attendance and participation
is in compliance with this policy and any other applicable laws.
      (2)   Prerequisites. A member of the covered group of the village shall
be provided the opportunity to attend an open and closed meeting or only one of
such meetings from a remote location if the member meets that following
conditions and a majority of a quorum of the covered body votes to approve the
remote attendance:
         (a)   The member must notify the recording secretary or clerk of the
covered body at least 24 hours before the meeting unless advance notice is
impractical;
         (b)   The member must meet one of three reasons described herein why
he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting, including either:
      1.   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or disability;
      2.   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the village; or
      3.   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency.
         (c)   A quorum of the covered body must be physically present.
      (3)   Voting procedure. After roll call, a vote of the covered body shall
be taken, considering the prerequisites set forth in division (D)(2) above, on
whether to allow an off-site Board of Trustees member to participate remotely.
All of the members physically present are permitted to vote on whether remote
participation will be allowed. A vote may be taken to permit remote
participation for a stated series of meetings if the same reason applies in
each case. Otherwise, a vote must be taken to allow each remote participation.
      (4)   Quorum and vote required. A quorum must be established by members
physically present at any meeting before it can be considered whether to allow
a member to participate in the meeting remotely. A vote of a majority of a
quorum shall be necessary to decide the issue. For the meeting to continue,
there shall always need to be a quorum physically present.
      (5)   Minutes. The member participating remotely shall be considered an
off-site participant and counted as present by means of video or audio
conference, for that meeting of the members is allowed to participate. The
meeting minutes of the village shall also reflect and state specifically
whether each member is physically present, present by video, or present by
audio means.

contribute both the employee and the employer’s share of IMRF and insurance
costs. Length of service or benefits shall not accrue or accumulate during a
special leave. A person either hired or promoted to fill the position vacated
by the person on leave shall be considered in that position temporarily and
shall relinquish it upon the employee’s return.
         (b)   If a special leave is approved by the Board of Trustees,

the emergency call shall be submitted and assigned to the village, and the

check was drawn. If military pay exceeds the employee’s earning for the period,
the Board of Trustees shall return the difference to the employee.
         (c)   To be eligible for military reserve leave or emergency call up
pay, the employee shall provide the village with a certificate from the
commanding officer of the employee’s unit that the leave taken was for either
such purpose.

the employee serves on jury duty. The employee shall receive his or her regular
pay for jury service. The employee shall present proof of jury service and the
amount of pay received shall be turned over to the Village Treasurer. The
employee shall also turn over to the village any expense allowances paid by the
court, if the jury duty is located at the County Courthouse. If an employee is
given an early release from jury duty, the employee shall then report to his or
her regular work assignment.
      (4)   Witness. An employee shall be excused from work when lawfully
subpoenaed to serve as a witness. The employee must present written proof of
the summons to testify to qualify for an excused absence. Notice to employee’s
supervisor should be made in advance of appearing in court. An employee’s
excused absence from work shall be on an unpaid basis, unless the employee’s
witness activity is work related and the witness activity is requested by the
village. The employee shall turn over to the village any witness fee when the
employee’s witness activity is work related. The employee may choose to use a
vacation day, if the witness activity is not work-related.

DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY
§ 32.115 PURPOSE.
   (A)   All employees, as a condition of employment, shall comply with the
village’s Drug Free Workplace Policy that is found in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-20)
   (B)   (1)   Drug abuse affects all aspects of citizens’ lives; it threatens
the workplace as well as the home, the school, and the community. The village
must take a firm stance against illicit drug use. The use of drugs, which term
for the purposes of this policy shall include alcohol in the workplace, is
unacceptable since it can adversely affect health, safety, and productivity, as
well as public confidence and trust. When drug use and/or involvement
interferes with an employee’s efficient and safe performance of work
responsibilities and/or reduces the employee’s dependability and
accountability, it creates a problem for the whole organization.
      (2)   Drug abuse inflicts notable human expense. Personal tragedies,
feelings of anxiety and depression, and diminishing coping skills are reflected
on an individual level. Dysfunctional and strained relationships mark the heavy
burden felt by the families of the drug and alcohol abuser.
      (3)   The cost of drug abuse, both on a personal and organizational
level, is unacceptable. The rising incidence in substance abuse makes it
imperative that the village combat this issue by implementing a zero tolerance

   (A)   There is no requirement by the employer to keep an employee on active
employment status who is receiving rehabilitative treatment if it is determined
that the employee’s current use of drugs prevents the individual from

constitute a threat to the property and/or safety of others.
   (B)   The employee shall pay for all costs of rehabilitation. The employee
may use accumulated paid leave, and take unpaid leave pending treatment, at the
discretion of the employer, and so long as the employee advised the
superintendent of use or abuse of drugs prior to occurrence of reasonable
suspicion.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-25)
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
§ 32.135 PURPOSE; POLICY CHANGES.
   (A)   (1)   This policy is intended to serve as a guide on the proper use of
the village electronic communication systems. This policy covers the use of all
forms of electronic communications, including, but not limited to, e-mail,
voice mail, fax machines, external bulletin boards, intranet, and the internet,
and applies to all users. Users are expected to read, understand, and follow
the provisions of this policy and will be held responsible for knowing its
contents. Use of the electronic communication system constitutes acceptance of
this policy and its requirements.
      (2)   The village provides electronic mail (e-mail) and/or internet
access to elected officials and staff who need it to perform the functions of
their position. The purpose of this document is to communicate to all personnel
their responsibility for acceptable use of the internet and e-mail (whether
sent over the internet or over the village’s own network). Policies and
procedures are also outlined for the disclosure and monitoring of the contents
of e-mail messages stored in the system when required.
      (3)   The village’s objectives for employees to use e-mail and/or the
internet include:
         (a)   Exchanging information more efficiently than by telephone or
written memorandum;
         (b)   Gathering information and performing research for departments;
and
         (c)   Reducing the handling of paper copy.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-35)
   (B)   The village reserves the right to change this policy at any time with
notice. Nothing in this policy is intended or should be construed as an
agreement and/or a contract expressed or implied. Policy changes will be
disseminated electronically or in written form within 48 hours of taking effect
after an ordinance has been adopted.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-57)
§ 32.136 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL). Electronic mail may include non-interactive
communication of text, data, image, or voice messages between a sender and
designated recipient(s) by systems utilizing telecommunications links. It may
also include correspondence transmitted and stored electronically using
software facilities called “mail,” “facsimile,” “messaging” systems or voice
messages transmitted and stored for later retrieval from a computer system.
   ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE. Proprietary software that changes information from its
native state to an unrecognizable coded state that can only be returned to its
native state with special software.

unauthorized access from users on the internet.
   INTERNET. A worldwide network of networks, connecting informational networks
communicating through a common communications language or protocol.

Although INTRANET pages may link to the internet, an INTRANET is not a site
accessed by the general public.

retrieval system based upon hypertext transfer protocol (http) that transfers
hypertext documents that can contain text, graphics, audio, video, and other
multimedia file types across a varied array of computer systems.
   USERS. Elected officials, department heads, employees, volunteers,
contractors, and consultants.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-36)
§ 32.137 OWNERSHIP.
   The electronic communication system is the property of the village. All
computer equipment, computer hardware, and computer software provided by the
village are the property of the village. All communications and information
transmitted by, received from, or stored in these systems are the property of
the village.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-37)
§ 32.138 USE OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.
   (A)   The village’s electronic communications systems, including e-mail and
the internet, are intended for village business use only. Personal uses of the
internet and e-mail systems are prohibited. The village reserves the right to
use filtering software to block access to internet sites that are considered
inappropriate or non-productive. The filtered sites shall be reviewed and
approved by the Mayor.
   (B)   Before using these systems, all users shall understand that any
information that is created, sent, received, accessed, or stored in these
systems shall be the property of the village and shall not be private. If a
user is permitted to use electronic communication systems, such use shall not
violate any section of this policy or interfere with user’s work performance.
   (C)   Users shall use the same care and discretion when writing e-mail and
other electronic communications as they would with any formal written
communication. Any messages or information sent by users to other individuals
via electronic communication systems, such as the internet or e-mail, are
statements identifiable and attributable to the village. Consequently, all
electronic communications sent by users shall be professional and comply with
this policy.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-38)
§ 32.139 PROHIBITED COMMUNICATIONS.
   (A)   Under no circumstances may any user operate the village’s electronic
communications systems for creating, possessing, uploading, downloading,
accessing, transmitting, or distributing material that is illegal, sexually
explicit, discriminatory, defamatory, or interferes with the productivity of
coworkers. Specifically prohibited communications include, but are not limited
to, communications that promote or transact the following: illegal activities;
outside business interests; malicious use; personal activities (including chat
rooms); jokes; political causes; football pools or other sorts of gambling;
recreational games; the creation or distribution of chain letters; list servers
for nonwork purposes; spam (mailing to a large number of people that contain
unwanted solicitations or information); sexual or any other form of harassment;
discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, gender, religion, or
disability; or for solicitations or advertisements for non-work purposes. Users
may not engage in any use that violates copyright or trademark laws.
   (B)   Also prohibited is any activity that could negatively impact public
trust and confidence in the village or create the appearance of impropriety.
   (C)   Users are also prohibited from posting information, opinions or
comments to internet discussion groups (for example: news groups, chat, list
servers, or electronic bulletin boards). Under no circumstances may any user
represent his or her own views as those of the village.
   (D)   Users may not disclose confidential or sensitive information. Personal
information, such as the home addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security
numbers of elected officials or employees, should never be disclosed on the
internet.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-39)
§ 32.140 NO PRESUMPTION OF POLICY.
   (A)   Although users may use passwords to access some electronic
communication systems, these communications should not be considered private.
Users should always assume that any communications, whether business-related or
personal, created, sent, received, or stored on the village’s electronic
communication systems may be read or heard by someone other than the intended
recipient.
   (B)   (1)   Users should also recognize that e-mail messages deleted from
the system may still be retrieved from the computer’s back-up system when
requested by authorized personnel.
      (2)   Consequently, messages that were previously deleted may be
recreated, printed out, or forwarded to someone else without the user’s
knowledge.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-40)
§ 32.141 VILLAGE’S RIGHT TO MONITOR USE.
   (A)   Under authorization of the Mayor, the village may monitor, intercept,
access, and disclose all information created, sent, received, or stored on its
electronic communication systems at any time, with or without notice to the
user. The contents of computers, voicemail, e-mail, and other electronic
communications will be inspected when there are allegations that there have
been breaches of confidentiality, security, or violations of this Electronic
Communications Policy. These inspections will also be conducted when it is
necessary to locate substantive information that is not readily available by
less intrusive means. Before providing access to store electronic
communications, such as e-mail messages, written authorization will be required
from the Mayor.
   (B)   The contents of the computers, voicemail, e-mail, and other electronic
communications may be turned over to the appropriate authority when there are
allegations that there have been violations of law.
   (C)   In addition, the village will regularly monitor and maintain a log of
the user’s internet access, including the type of sites accessed, the name of
the server, and the time of day that access occurs. The Mayor will have access
to this log upon request. They may use this information that was obtained
through monitoring as a basis for employee discipline.
   (D)   The Mayor may authorize individuals for investigative purposes to
engage in activities otherwise prohibited by this policy.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-41)
§ 32.142 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   (1)   Users shall not download software programs of any kind. No
software is to be installed on village computers without the approval of the
Board of Trustees. Users may not upload, download, or otherwise transmit
copyrighted, trademarked, or patented material; trade secrets; or confidential,
private, or proprietary information or materials. Users may not use the
village’s electronic communication systems to gain unauthorized access to
remote computers or other systems or to damage, alter, or disrupt such
computers or systems in any way, nor may users use someone else’s code or
password or disclose anyone’s code or password, including their own.
      (2)   It is a violation of this policy for users to intentionally
intercept, eavesdrop, record, or alter another person’s internet and e-mail
messages. Users may not allow unauthorized individuals to have access to or use
the village’s electronic communication systems, or otherwise permit any use
that would jeopardize the security of the village’s electronic communication
systems. Also, users may not post an unauthorized home page or similar web
site.
   (B)   Users may not make unauthorized commitments or promises that might be
perceived as binding the village. Users must use their real names when sending
e-mail messages or other electronic communications and may not misrepresent,
obscure, or in any way attempt to subvert the information necessary to identify
the actual person responsible for the electronic communication. Sending an e-
mail message under a fictitious or false name is a violation of this policy.
Likewise, using another user’s account or login ID constitutes a violation of
this policy.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-42)
§ 32.143 PASSWORDS.
   (A)   Each user will maintain a unique password. Users must keep their
passwords confidential and must never leave their computers unattended when
logged into the system. Passwords shall be changed whenever a password may have
been compromised or revealed or when the computer security system requests a
new password.
   (B)   Directories of user e-mail addresses may not be made available for
public access. No visitors, contractors, or temporary employees may use the
village’s e-mail without prior written authorization from the Mayor.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-43)
§ 32.144 INTERNET USAGE.
   (A)   Access to the internet from any PC connected to the village’s network
is only allowed in accordance with this policy. Alternate methods of internet
access, such as using a modem to access a personal dial-up internet account, is
prohibited, as it may compromise the village’s network security exposing it to
potential harm from computer hackers.
   (B)   Sessions on the internet are logged automatically in exactly the same
way that phone numbers are logged in the phone system. Employees should not use
the internet for tasks that they would not want to be logged. Web browsers
leave “footprints” providing a trail of all site visits. Employees should not
visit any site where they would be reluctant to leave their name and work
locations.
   (C)   (1)   Employees should use appropriate judgment before filling out a
form included in a web page. The form shall pass through many interconnecting
computers and networks before reaching its destination.
      (2)   Other individuals will be able to eavesdrop on it. Personal or
valuable information on the form may not remain confidential. Under no
circumstances should employees ever put a Social Security number on the
internet.
   (D)   (1)   An internet message sent from the village’s address constitutes
a village communication; therefore, it should be composed and structured
correctly.
      (2)   Whenever possible, employees should spell check messages prior to
transmission, especially when sending to a non-village address.
   (E)   (1)   Sending e-mail from the village’s address can be likened to
sending a letter on village letterhead. Messages may be forwarded by the
recipient to others, printed in a location where others may view the message,
and/or directed to the wrong recipient.
      (2)   Also, computer forensic experts can often retrieve e-mail
previously deleted. An ill-considered remark can return to haunt the sender
later.
   (F)   Employees shall be courteous and follow generally accepted standards
of etiquette; protect others’ privacy and confidentiality; consider the
village’s needs before sending, filing, or destroying e-mail messages; and
remove personal messages, temporary records, and duplicate copies in a timely
manner.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-44)
§ 32.145 RECORDS.
   (A)   Certain significant types of e-mail messages or their attached files
may be considered records and should be retained if required by the village’s
record-retention policies. Examples of messages sent by e-mail that may
constitute records include:
      (1)   Policies and directives;
      (2)   Correspondence or memoranda related to official business;
      (3)   Work schedules and assignments;
      (4)   Agendas and minutes of meetings;
      (5)   Drafts of documents that are circulated for comment or approval;
      (6)   Any document that initiates, authorizes, or completes a business
transaction; and
      (7)   Final reports or recommendations.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-45)
   (B)   (1)   The content and maintenance of a user’s electronic mailbox are
the user’s responsibility. The content and maintenance of a user’s disk storage
area are the user’s responsibility.
      (2)   Each user should review his or her electronic records for deletion
every 30 days.
      (3)   Messages of transitory or little value that are not normally
retained in record-keeping systems should be regularly deleted. Informational
messages, such as meeting notices, reminders, informal notes, and telephone
messages, should be deleted once the administrative purpose is served.
      (4)   If it is necessary to retain any e-mail message for an extended
period, users should transfer it from the e-mail system to an appropriate
electronic or other filing system.
      (5)   With the approval of the Mayor, the Village Clerk or one of his or
her staff members designated by him or her is permitted to remove any
information retained in an e-mail system for more than 30 days.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-46)
§ 32.146 E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND ACCESS.
   (A)    During a user’s absence, the Mayor may authorize the Village Clerk to
access the user’s e-mail messages and electronic internet records without the
consent of the user when necessary to carry out normal business functions.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-47)
   (B)   The village reserves the right to keep a user’s e-mail address active
for a reasonable period of time following the user’s departure to ensure that
important business communications reach their respective department.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-53)
§ 32.147 VIRUSES AND TAMPERING.
   (A)   Any files downloaded from the internet must be scanned with virus
detection software before installation and execution. All computers designated
as having access to the internet and e-mail must have virus detection software
installed on them. Users may not deliberately disable the virus protection
capabilities of these systems. The intentional introduction of viruses,
attempts to breach system security, or other malicious tampering with any of
the village’s electronic communication systems is expressly prohibited. Users
must immediately report any viruses, tampering, or other system breaches to the
Mayor or a designated officer.
   (B)   Many viruses are transmitted through the e-mail system as attachments.
Caution should be practiced prior to the accessing of any attachments to e-mail
messages. Never access any unexpected attachments without verifying the source
and reason for it, even if you recognize the sender of the e-mail. It is common
practice for hackers to alter the source of an e-mail in an attempt to spread a
virus.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-50)
§ 32.148 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY FOR INTERNET USE.
   The village is not responsible for material viewed or downloaded by users
from the internet. The internet provides access to a significant amount of
information, some of which contains offensive, sexually explicit, and
inappropriate material. It is difficult to avoid contact with this material;
therefore, users of the internet do so at their own risk.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-51)
§ 32.149 DISCLAIMER NOT TO WASTE RESOURCES.
   Users must not deliberately perform actions that waste electronic
communication resources or unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of
other users. This includes, but is not limited to, subscribing to list servers,
mailing lists, or web sites not directly related to the user’s job
responsibilities; spending nonproductive time on the internet; and doing large
non-work related file downloads or mass mailings. Electronic communication
resources are limited and users have a duty to conserve these resources.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-52)
§ 32.150 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS.
   The village will not accept Freedom of Information Act (F.O.I.A., being 5
ILCS 140/1.1 et seq.) requests from the public via the internet. If a citizen
e-mails a F.O.I.A. request to a user, the employee should notify the citizen
that these requests must be made in writing in compliance with the Freedom of
Information Code. (See §§
33.095 through
33.104.)
(Prior Code, § 11-9-54)
§ 32.151 CREDIT CARD USE ON THE INTERNET.
   Before making purchases on the internet, users who are authorized to use
village credit cards must ensure that they are using a secured site. The
village recommends that users do not use their credit cards over the internet
and expressly disclaims responsibility for any loss or damages that results
from credit card usage over the internet.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-55)
§ 32.152 VIOLATIONS.
   Violations of the policy codified herein may subject employees to
disciplinary action ranging from the removal of electronic communication
privileges to dismissal from employment. Village employees who observe
violations of the policy codified herein are obligated to report the violations
to the Mayor or Village Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 11-9-56) Penalty, see §
10.999
RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYER
§ 32.165 PERSONNEL FILE.
   (A)   Employees are allowed to look at their own personnel files during
normal business hours. Persons wishing to view their own file shall file a
written request with the Mayor or the Village Clerk. A copy of the request
shall be placed in the employee’s personnel file.
   (B)   Nothing should be placed in an employee’s personnel file, nor shall
anything be removed from the file without the consent of the Mayor and Board of
Trustees. Records of prior grievances and discipline action shall be maintained
in the employee’s personnel file. The final decision to remove items lies
within the discretion of the Mayor and the Board of Trustees.
(Prior Code, § 11-10-1)

performance dependabilities lies within the sound discretion of the
superintendent.
(Prior Code, § 11-10-2)
§ 32.167 SAFETY.
   (A)   The superintendent shall implement any safety procedures adopted by
the village, and employees shall comply with any of the safety procedures.
   (B)   All employees are directed to report any hazardous conditions to their
supervisor immediately.
   (C)   Due to the open-office design of many department buildings, it is
impossible to provide security for personal belongings left unattended.
Employees are advised to keep their wallets, purses, and the like in their
possession at all times. The village cannot be responsible for losses due to
theft.
(Prior Code, § 11-10-3)
§ 32.168 VILLAGE’S RIGHTS.
   (A)   The employee recognizes that the village possesses the exclusive right
to operate and direct the employees of the village in all aspects, including,
but not limited to, all rights and authority granted by law.
   (B)   The employee further recognizes that this Employee Code is not a
binding contract between the village and the employee. Nothing contained in

between the village and its employees from time to time.
(Prior Code, § 11-11-1)
§ 32.169 NEW REGULATIONS.
   The village has the right to unilaterally create new employment policies and

§ 32.170 MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES.
   The employer has the ultimate responsibility for proper management,

of an employee since the employee’s last date of hire with the village within
the employee’s department.
      (2)   In the event an employee is transferred from or to another
department of the village, the employee’s total continuous employment with the

SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY
§ 32.185 STATEMENT.
   The village will not tolerate and will seek to eradicate any behavior by its
employees, volunteers, or students which constitutes sexual misconduct toward

§ 32.186 REPORTING PROCEDURES; DESIGNATED SEXUAL ABUSE COORDINATOR.
   (A)   It is the express policy of the village to encourage victims of sexual
misconduct, and their parents or guardians in the case of minors, to come
forward with such claims. The village shall designate a Sexual Abuse
Coordinator, who hereinafter may be referred to as “Coordinator,” who shall
remain accountable for the implementation and monitoring of this policy. The
identity of the Sexual Abuse Coordinator shall remain on file with the village.
In order to conduct an immediate investigation, any incident of sexual
misconduct shall be reported as quickly as possible in confidence, as follows:
      (1)   Employees and volunteers are required to report any known or
suspected incidents of sexual misconduct. They must also report to their
supervisor or the Sexual Abuse Coordinator. If the person to whom an employee
or volunteer is directed to report is the offending person, the report should
be made to the next higher level of administration or supervision; and
      (2)   All formal complaints will be given a full impartial and timely
investigation. During such investigation, while every effort will be made to
protect the privacy rights of all parties’ confidentiality cannot be
guaranteed.
   (B)   Any village employee or volunteer who is determined, after an
investigation, to have engaged in sexual misconduct in violation of this policy
will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
   (C)   False accusations regarding sexual misconduct will not be tolerated,
and any person knowingly making a false accusation shall likewise be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including discharge, with regard to employees or
volunteers.
   (D)   The village shall discipline any individual who retaliates against any
person who reports alleged sexual misconduct or who retaliates against any
person who testifies, assists, or participates in an investigation, a
proceeding or a hearing relating to a sexual misconduct complaint. Retaliation
includes, but is not limited to, any form of intimidation, reprisal, or
harassment.
(Prior Code, § 11-13-2)
§ 32.187 CHILD ABUSE.
   (A)   Sexual abuse of any minor is a crime.
   (B)   Any case of known or suspected child abuse of a minor must be reported
immediately in compliance with state mandatory reporting guidelines and to the
Sexual Abuse Coordinator and the Village Attorney’s office. In the event that
the Sexual Abuse Coordinator is first notified of an incident of known or
suspected child abuse, the Sexual Abuse Coordinator shall immediately notify
the child’s parent or legal guardian as the case be, and the appropriate legal
authorities as required by state or local law. The Sexual Abuse Coordinator
shall prepare a suspected child abuse standard report and immediately follow-up
to investigate the incident and to ascertain the condition of the child. The
Sexual Abuse Coordinator shall communicate any questions or concerns about any
incident with the State Attorney. Any employee or volunteer involved in a
reported incident of sexual misconduct or child abuse shall be immediately
relieved of responsibilities that involve interaction with minors or shall be
suspended, as determined by the employee’s supervisor. Reinstatement of
employees or volunteers involved in a reported incident of child abuse shall
occur only after all allegations of child abuse have been cleared by the
county.
   (C)   The Sexual Abuse Coordinator shall maintain all records and
documentation required by law or otherwise required by this code and other such
related policies of the village including all documents related to procedures
for hiring, screening, employee/volunteer code of conduct, training, sign-in/
sign-out, pick-up and release procedures, incident reporting follow-up, and
disciplinary action.
(Prior Code, § 11-13-3)   
DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES
§ 32.200 PROCEDURE, GENERALLY.
   (A)   The formal disciplinary process is a five step procedure, but
dismissal may occur at any step in the process. Superintendents may use the
discipline form attached as
Appendix B of this chapter for documentation purposes.
   (B)   Under normal circumstances, these steps are outlined in §§
32.201 through
32.207.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-1)
§ 32.201 VERBAL AND WRITTEN REPRIMAND.
   (A)   A verbal reprimand informs an employee of unsatisfactory conduct,
attitude, or performance, and acknowledges that continued such actions will
result in more severe disciplinary actions. The reprimand should be done in
private, and should be documented with the date and nature of the problem and
placed in the employee’s personnel file.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-2)
   (B)   A written reprimand informs an employee of unsatisfactory conduct,
attitude, or performance. Written reprimand is more severe than a verbal
reprimand, but serves the same purpose to acknowledge further unsatisfactory
conduct, attitude, or performance will result in more severe disciplinary
action. A copy of the written reprimand will be sent to the employee, the
superintendent, Mayor, and employee’s personnel file.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-3)
§ 32.202 PROBATION.
   (A)   Employee may be placed on probation by the superintendent and/or the
Mayor if the employee’s performance is substandard and/or the employee’s
conduct and behavior are inappropriate and not condoned by management. Employee
may be placed on probation not to exceed six months.
   (B)   At the end of three months, an informal evaluation of the employee’s
performance will be conducted.
   (C)   At the end of the probationary period, the employee’s performance will
be formally evaluated.
   (D)   Evaluations will determine if the employee should be retained. If the
employee violates the conditions of the probation, the employee may be subject
to termination. Removal from probationary status is based upon satisfactory
completion of the probationary period, recommendation from the employee’s
immediate superintendent, and approval of the Mayor.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-4)
§ 32.203 ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE.
   An employee may be placed on administrative leave by the Mayor with or
without pay and benefits pending an investigation based on alleged violation of
the municipal policies and procedures. The administrative leave may be extended
for the period of time the investigation continues, but no longer than 30 days.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-5)
§ 32.204 SUSPENSION.
   (A)   Suspension of an employee would be at the discretion of the
superintendent. The suspension will result in a loss of salary for the period
of the suspension. Upon return to work the suspended employee will be placed on
probationary status for a period not to exceed six months. If the employee
violates the conditions of the probation, the employee may be subject to
termination.
   (B)   Removal from probationary status is based upon satisfactory completion
of a probationary period, a recommendation from the employee’s immediate
superintendent, and the approval the Mayor and Board of Trustees. The period of
suspension may be up to, but not exceeding, 30 days off without pay in one
calendar year. The suspension may include demotion, and is within the
discretion of the superintendent.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-6)
§ 32.205 DISMISSAL.
   Dismissal shall be used as a disciplinary action of last resort at the

or political beliefs. This prohibition on discipline does not apply to
individuals in policy making or confidential positions or where an overriding
interest or vital importance exists which requires that an employee’s political
beliefs and activities conform to those of the superintendent or the corporate
authorities. The village also recognizes that false accusations can have
serious affects on innocent men and women. We trust that all employees will
continue to act in a responsible and professional manner to establish a
pleasant working environment free of discrimination.
(Prior Code, § 11-14-9)
APPENDIX A: EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION OF PERSONNEL CODE, DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE
POLICY, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY, AND DISCLAIMER OF EMPLOYMENT
The Employee Code of the village is not intended to create any employment
relationship with any employees that is contractual in nature. All employees
are employed at the will of the village, and employees can be terminated at

procedures contained in this Code are illustrative in nature, and only provide
examples of the manner in which employees may be disciplined or terminated. Any

IDENTITY THEFT PROGRAMS
§ 33.001 OBJECTIVE; SCOPE.
   (A)   The purpose of this Identity Theft Prevention Program (hereinafter
“the Program”) is to protect customers of the village’s utility services from
identity theft. The Program is intended to establish reasonable policies and
procedures to facilitate the detection, prevention, and mitigation of identity
theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts and activity on
existing covered accounts.
(Prior Code, § 22-1-1)
   (B)   (1)   The Program applies to the creation, modification, and access to
identifying information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated
by the village (water, sewer, and refuse) by any and all personnel of the
village, including management personnel.
      (2)   The Program does not replace or repeal any previously existing
policies or programs addressing some or all of the activities that are the
subject of the Program, but rather it is intended to supplement any such
existing policies and programs.
(Prior Code, § 22-1-2)
Cross-reference:
   Utilities generally, see
Chapter 50
§ 33.002 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      COVERED ACCOUNT.
         (a)   An account that the village offers or maintains, primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit
multiple payments of transactions (16 C.F.R. § 681.1(b)(3)(I)).
         (b)   A utility account is a COVERED ACCOUNT. The term COVERED ACCOUNT
also includes other accounts offered or maintained by the village for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to the village or its customers from
identity theft (16 C.F.R. § 681.1(b)(3)(ii)).
      IDENTITY THEFT. A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority (12 C.F.R. § 1022.3 and 16
C.F.R. §§ 681.1(b)(8).
      IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, Social Security number, date of birth, official state or
government issued driver’s license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer, or taxpayer identification
number. Additional examples of IDENTIFYING INFORMATION are set forth in 12
C.F.R. § 1022.3(g).
      RED FLAG. A pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
   (B)   Certain terms used but not otherwise defined, herein shall have the
meanings given to them in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Identity Theft
Rules (16 C.F.R. pt. 681) or the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C.
§§ 1681 et seq.), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act
of 2003 into law on December 4, 2003 (Pub. L. No. 108-159).
(Prior Code, § 22-1-3)
§ 33.003 POLICY AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Administration of the program. Issues to be addressed in the annual
identity theft prevention report include:
      (1)   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts
and activity with respect to existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Service provider arrangements;
      (3)   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management’s
response; and
      (4)   Recommendations for material changes to the Program, if needed for
improvement.
   (B)   Identity theft prevention elements; identification of relevant red
flags. The village has considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples
of possible red flags from the FTC’s identity theft rules and has reviewed the
village’s past history with instances of identity theft, if any. The village
hereby determines that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of
thie Program given the relative size of the village and the limited nature and
scope of the services that the village provides to its citizens:
      (1)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers, including:
         (a)   A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report
or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency;
         (b)   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze
in response to a request for a consumer report;
         (c)   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in § 681.1(b) of the FTC’s identity theft rules; and
         (d)   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
            1.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            2.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
            3.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            4.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      (2)   The presentation of suspicious documents, including:
         (a)   Documents provided for identification appear to have been
altered or forged;
         (b)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
         (c)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification;
         (d)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the village, such as a
signature card or a recent check; and
         (e)   An applicant appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed or reassembled.
      (3)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change, including:
         (a)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the village. For example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report
or Consumer Reporting Agencies Identity (“CRA ID”) check response; or
            2.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is
listed on the Social Security Administration’s death master file.
         (b)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth;
         (c)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the village. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
            2.   The phone number on an application is the same as the number
provided on a fraudulent application.
         (d)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the village. For example:
            1.   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         (e)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers;
         (f)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers;
         (g)   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete;
         (h)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the village; and
         (i)   If the village uses challenge questions, the person opening the
covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
      (4)   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account, including:
         (a)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a
covered account, the village receives a request for the addition of authorized
users on the account;
         (b)   A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example: the customer fails to make
the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments;
         (c)   A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities;
         (d)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account,
the expected pattern of usage, and other relevant factors);
         (e)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as
undeliverable although usage of utility products or services continues in
connection with the customer’s covered account;
         (f)   The village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements; and
         (g)   The village is notified of unauthorized usage of utility
products or services in connection with a customer’s covered account.
      (5)   The village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
   (C)   Detection of red flags.
      (1)   (a)   The employees of the village who interact directly with
customers on a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for
monitoring the information and documentation provided by the customer and any
third-party service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and
the modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise.
         (b)   Management shall see to it that all employees who might be
called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such
that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in
the Program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to
recognize the red flags identified in this subchapter shall not open a new
account for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any
customer with access to information in an existing account without the direct
supervision and specific approval of a management employee.
         (c)   Management employees shall be properly trained such that they
can recognize the relevant red flags identified in this subchapter and exercise
sound judgment in connection with the response to any unresolved red flags that
may present themselves in connection with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or accessing of an existing account. Management employees shall be
responsible for making the final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
      (2)   (a)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer’s identity, and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained.
         (b)   Such policy shall be generally consistent with the spirit of the
Customer Identification Program rules (31 C.F.R. § 1020.220) implementing § 326
(a) of the United States Patriot Act, being 31 U.S.C. § 5318(I), but need not
be as detailed. The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing
accounts shall establish their identity before being allowed to make
modifications to or otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
   (D)   Response to detected red flags.
      (1)   If the responsible employees of the village as set forth in the
previous section are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a
reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to
open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account based on
the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider, the village shall not open the new account or modify or
otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be.
Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or the modification or
access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the village
and shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
      (2)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security
incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer’s account, or a
notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent
individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity
theft when a red flag is detected include:
         (a)   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;
         (b)   Contacting the customer;
         (c)   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security
devices that permit access to a covered account;
         (d)   Reopening a covered account with a new account number;
         (e)   Not opening a new covered account;
         (f)   Closing an existing covered account;
         (g)   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a
covered account to a debt collector;
         (h)   Notifying law enforcement; and/or
         (i)   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
(Prior Code, § 22-1-4)
§ 33.004 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
   (A)   Initial risk assessment; covered account. Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of “covered account” in the FTC’s identity theft rules. Therefore,
the village determines that with respect to its residential utility accounts it
offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The village also performed an initial
risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or maintains any other
accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or the
utility from identity theft. In making this determination, the village
considered:
      (1)   The methods it uses to open its accounts;
      (2)   The methods it uses to access its accounts; and
      (3)   Its previous experience with identity theft, and it concluded that
it does not offer or maintain any such other covered accounts.
   (B)   Program updates; risk assessment. The Program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary, but at least annually, to
reflect changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider
in the Program update include:
         (1)   An assessment of the risk factors identified above;
         (2)   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems
or procedures;
         (3)   Changes in methods of identity theft;
         (4)   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity
theft; and
         (5)   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers,
acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   (C)   Training and oversight. All staff and third-party service providers
performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to
be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.
   (D)   Other legal requirements. Awareness of the following related legal
requirements should be maintained:
      (1)   “Reporting of Suspicious Activities,” 31 U.S.C. § 5318(g);
      (2)   “Identity Theft Prevention; Fraud Alerts and Active Duty Alerts -
Limitations on Use of Information for Credit Extensions,” 15 U.S.C. § 1681c-l
(h);
      (3)   “Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer
Reporting Agencies,” 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2; and
      (4)   “Requirements on Use of Consumer Reports,” 15 U.S.C. § 1681m.
(Prior Code, § 22-1-5)
§ 33.005 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The initial adoption and approval of the Identity Theft Prevention Program
shall be by ordinance of the Board of Trustees. Thereafter, changes to the
Program of a day-to-day operational character and decisions relating to the
interpretation and implementation of the Program may be made by the Director of
Finance (Program Administrator). Major changes or shifts of policy positions
under the Program shall only be made by the Board of Trustees. Development,
implementation, administration, and oversight of the Program will be the
responsibility of the Program Administrator. The Program Administrator may, but
shall not be required to, appoint a committee to administer the Program. The
Program Administrator shall be the head of any such committee. The Program
Administrator will report at least annually to the Board of Trustees regarding
compliance with the Program.
(Prior Code, § 22-1-6)
§ 33.006 FRAUD CLASSIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Identity theft (fraud) Type 1: new accounts. A person may establish a
utility service using another person’s identity because:
      (1)   The perpetrator defaulted on a past utility account or other
account and so would not be eligible for service under his or her own name; or
      (2)   The perpetrator intends to establish fraudulent proof of residency
in order to commit fraud elsewhere.

reasonable right to expect persons employed by the village to be free from the
effects of alcohol and drugs. The village, as the employer, has the right to

adverse effects of drugs and alcohol. Accordingly, the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, possession, or use of a controlled substance, including cannabis
and alcohol, is prohibited in the workplace or while acting on behalf of the
village. Employees are required to sign a release and consent/authorization
form, a copy of which is included with this policy, at the time the policy is

Reasonable suspicion exists if the facts and circumstances warrant a rational
inference that an employee has violated any of the acts prohibited by this
policy. Reasonable suspicion shall be based upon the following:

disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 33.075 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT GENERALLY.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, being 42
U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq. All persons have a right to work in an environment free
from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
this village to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official,
municipal agent, municipal employee, or municipal agency or office on the basis
of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal
employees, and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually
harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack
thereof.   
(Prior Code, § 22-7-1) (Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-2-2018) Penalty, see §
33.999
§ 33.076 DEFINITION.
   (A)   SEXUAL HARASSMENT Is the policy codified within this subchapter
(hereinafter, “the policy”) adopts the definition of SEXUAL HARASSMENT as
stated in the State Human Rights Act, being 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq., which
currently defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute SEXUAL HARASSMENT includes:
         (a)   Verbal sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy, or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside their presence, of a sexual nature;
         (b)   Non-verbal, suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls,” “smacking”,”
or “kissing” noises;
         (c)   Visual, posters, signs, pin-ups, or slogans of a sexual nature,
or viewing pornographic material or websites;
         (d)   Physical touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, or any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
         (e)   Textual/electronic SEXTING (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking or threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e.g., e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages, and social network websites like Facebook
and Twitter).
   (B)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a reasonable person.

§ 33.077 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes himself
or herself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident
(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his or her
position to the offending employee, and his or her immediate supervisor. It is
not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the
report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following.
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his or her objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the village manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer
of the village.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the village will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside the village.
         (a)   The purpose of the policy is to establish prompt, thorough and
effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that
problems can be identified and remedied by the village. However, all municipal
employees have the right to contact the State Department of Human Rights (IDHR)
or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding
filing a formal complaint with those entities.
         (b)   An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time, and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos, and telephone
messages.
   (D)   (1)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
village.
      (2)   However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Prior Code, § 22-7-3) (Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-2-2018)
§ 33.078 RETALIATION FOR REPORTING ALLEGATION PROHIBITED.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee, or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of the policy codified herein, RETALIATORY ACTION
means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or
transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal
employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or
other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation.
   (F)   According to the State Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the State Human
Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.

33.999
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see 740 ILCS 174/15(b)
§ 33.079 CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable
pursuant to village policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks, and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this
policy or the “Prohibition on Sexual Harassment” contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65,
may be subject to a fine.
   (B)   Any discipline imposed by the village shall be separate and distinct
from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties
imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency.
(Prior Code, § 22-7-5) (Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-2-2018) Penalty, see §
33.999
§ 33.080 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A FALSE REPORT is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven.
   (B)   Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or
frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary
action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation
of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge
pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures,
employee handbooks, and/or collective bargaining agreements.
(Prior Code, § 22-7-6) (Ord. 2018-01, passed 1-2-2018) Penalty, see §
33.999
§ 33.081 EMPLOYEE RECEIPT AND ACCEPTANCE.
   (A)   Each employee of the village shall sign an employee receipt and
acceptance acknowledging receipt of the policy prohibiting sexual harassment,
accepting responsibility to read and know the contents of said policy, agreeing
to follow the terms of said policy, and acknowledging that failure to follow
the terms of the policy may result in disciplinary action including
termination.
   (B)   A copy of said employee receipt and acceptance shall be maintained in
the employee’s personnel file.

include the following information in any request for public records:
         (a)   The requestor’s full name, mailing address, and telephone number

writing and in accordance with §
33.101.
(Prior Code, § 15-1-7)

extensive search for the records responsive to it;

Act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions;

A failure to render a decision within seven working days shall be considered a
denial of the request.
(Prior Code, § 15-1-8)
§ 33.099 UNDULY BURDENSOME REQUEST.
   (A)   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the village, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on the
village strongly outweighs the public interest in the information.
   (B)   (1)   If the village responds to a categorical request by stating that
compliance would unduly burden its operation, it shall do so in a writing
signed by the Village Clerk specifying the reasons why it would be unduly
burdensome and the extent to which compliance will so burden the operation of
the village. After receipt of this response in writing, the person making the
request shall have an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable
proportions.

manageable proportions, the response of the village shall be treated as a

9.

under the provisions of this subchapter, the notice of denial shall specify the
exemption claimed to authorize the denial and briefly explain how the exemption
applies to the specified records withheld.
   (B)   A requestor may appeal a denial of a request for public records to the
Village President. All appeals shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the
Village President in an envelope clearly marked “FOIA APPEAL,” and shall
include a copy of the original request, a copy of the denial or a statement
that the village failed to respond within seven working days; and a written
statement setting forth the reasons the requestor believes the appeal should be
granted.

   (A)   Because of the possibility of the occurrence of disasters of
unprecedented size and destructiveness resulting from the explosion in this or
in a neighboring municipality of atomic or other means from without, or by
means of sabotage or other disloyal actions within, or from fire, flood,
earthquake, or other natural or human-made causes, and in order to insure that
the village will be prepared to and will adequately deal with any such
disasters, preserve the lives and property of the people of the village, and
protect the public peace, health, and safety in the event of such a disaster,
it is found and declared to be necessary:
      (1)   To create a municipal emergency management agency;
      (2)   To confer upon the Mayor the extraordinary power and authority set
forth under §§
34.001 through
34.006; and
      (3)   To provide for the rendering of mutual aid to other cities and
political subdivisions with respect to the carrying out of emergency management
operations.
   (B)   Whenever the Mayor determines after an investigation that a dangerous
situation or a potentially dangerous situation exists which could cause death
to individuals or serious injury to property or the health and welfare of
public, the Mayor may declare that a state of emergency exists. The
extraordinary powers may not be exercised until an ordinance shall have been
adopted which shall establish standards for the determination by the Mayor of
when the state of emergency exists and shall provide that the Mayor may not
exercise such extraordinary power and authority except after signing under oath
a statement finding that such standards have been met, setting forth facts to
substantiate such findings, describing the nature of the emergency and
declaring that a state of emergency exists. This statement shall be filed with
the Village Clerk of the municipality as soon as practical. A state of
emergency shall expire not later than the adjournment of the first regular
meeting of the corporate authorities after the state of emergency is declared.
A subsequent state of emergency may be declared if necessary.
   (C)   It is further declared to be the purpose of this code of ordinances
and the policy of the village that all emergency management programs of the
village be coordinated to the maximum extent with the comparable functions of
the federal and state governments, including their various departments and
agencies, of other municipalities and localities and private agencies of every
type, to the end that the most effective preparation and use may be made of the
nation’s manpower, resources, and facilities for dealing with any disaster that
may occur.

licensed elsewhere to practice any such profession, trade, or occupation may,

not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with
the Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount
of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the
filing of the application, but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed.
   (B)   (1)   However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid
the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with
applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the
result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application
shall be deemed invalid and void.
      (2)   The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator.
   (C)   However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of

   (A)   Customer accepts service. The rates, rules, and regulations contained
in this title shall constitute and be considered a part of the contract with
every person, company, or corporation who is supplied with water and sewer
services from the waterworks and sewerage system and every person, company, or
corporation, hereinafter called a “customer,” who accepts and uses village
water and sewer services shall be held to have consented to be bound thereby.
   (B)   Not liable for interrupted service. The Utilities Department shall
endeavor at all times to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of service,
but in case the supply of service shall be interrupted, irregular, defective,
or fail from causes beyond its control, or through ordinary negligence of
employees, servants, or agents, the Utilities Department shall not be liable
therefor.
   (C)   Using services without paving. Any person using utility services from
the village without paying therefor, or who shall be found guilty of breaking
the seal of any meter or appurtenances, or bypass any meter, shall be guilty of
violating this code, and, upon conviction, shall be fined a sum as provided in
§
10.999.
   (D)   Destroying property. Any person found guilty of defacing, tampering,

shall, upon conviction for such act, be fined as provided in §
10.999.
   (E)   Service obtained by fraud.
      (1)   All contracts for water and sewer services must be made in the name
of the head of the household, firm, or corporation using the established
spelling of that person’s or firm’s name. Attempts to obtain service by the use
of other names, different spellings, or by substituting other persons or firms
will be considered a subterfuge and service will be denied.
      (2)   If service has been discontinued because of nonpayment of bills, or
any unpaid obligation and service has again been obtained through subterfuge,
misrepresentation, or fraud, that service will be promptly disconnected and the
whole or such part of the advanced payment as may be necessary to satisfy the
unpaid obligation shall be retained by the village and credited to the
appropriate account.
   (F)   Failure to receive bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a
customer from his or her obligation to pay within the time specified. Should
the Utilities Department be unable to bill a customer for services used during
any month, the following billing shall include the charges for services used
during the unbilled month.
   (G)   Request to discontinue services. Services shall have been deemed to
have been supplied to any property connected to the water and sewer systems
during a month unless the customer notifies the village prior to the first day
of the new billing month in which the services are to be discontinued.
   (H)   Billing; utility shut-off; hearing.
      (1)   (a)   All bills for utility and trash services shall be due and
payable at the office of the Village Clerk upon presentation. All customers

         (b)   Any failure to present a bill or copy thereof at the time of
payment shall result in an administrative fee, further described in §
50.999.
      (2)   Any customer who fails to pay the utility and trash bills within 17
days of presentation shall have the utility services disconnected after a
written notice by the Village Clerk has been mailed by certified mail to the
customer, affording the customer an opportunity for a hearing. The aforesaid
notice shall be mailed to the customer 12 days after billing specifically
advising the customer of the following:
         (a)   Name and address of the customer and the amount of the bill;
         (b)   The date, time, and location of the hearing to be held;
         (c)   The customer has a right to be heard and to present evidence in
his or her behalf if he or she does not agree with the bill; and
         (d)   If the customer fails to appear at the hearing, the customer’s
utility service shall be terminated without further proceedings.
      (3)   The time, date, and location of the hearing shall be determined by
the Mayor, the Village Clerk, or the designee of the Mayor. The Mayor, Village
Clerk, or designee shall preside over the hearing. The Mayor, Village Clerk, or
designee of the Mayor shall make a final determination as to the rights of the
consumer and the village based on the information received at the hearing.
      (4)   The customer shall be notified within two working days of the
decision rendered by the Hearing Officer. If the service is to be discontinued,
a date and time will be set out in the notice to terminate the service or
services of the customer. Notice of the Hearing Officer’s decision shall be
made by first-class mail.
      (5)   If the Hearing Officer decides in favor of the village, the village
shall have the right to discontinue the customer’s utility services. Should the
customer fail to appear at the hearing, or should the notice be returned non-
accepted, then the village shall also have the right to terminate the
customer’s utility services without further proceedings.
      (6)   If the customer who has been notified for nonpayment of utility
bills is not the owner of record, then the village shall also notify the owner
of the property by first-class mail.
   (I)   Lien notice.
      (1)   Whenever a bill for utility services remains unpaid for 60 days
after it has been rendered, the Village Clerk shall file with the County
Recorder of Deeds a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the
legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a
notice that the municipality claims a lien for this amount to the period
covered by the bill.
      (2)   If the consumer of utility services whose bill is unpaid is not the
owner of the premises and the Village Clerk has notice of this, then the notice
shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her address is known to
the Village Clerk whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days
after it has been rendered.
      (3)   The failure of the Village Clerk to record such lien or to mail
such notice, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not
affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid utility bills as mentioned
herein.
   (J)   Foreclosure of lien.
      (1)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility charges shall be sold
for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to
pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in the name of the
village.

proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over

cause fails to properly register the utilities, passing through the same, the
consumer shall be charged the average charge of the previous three months
usage.
   (B)   If no record of the previous three months exists, then it shall be the
duty of the Village Clerk to estimate the amount of utilities consumed during

the meters during inclement weather.
(Prior Code, § 38-2-4)
§ 50.019 UTILITY SERVICE FEES MANDATORY.

      (1)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD of 200 mg/l); and
      (2)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
   (C)   It shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate sewer volume, pounds of SS, and pounds of BOD to be
treated;
      (2)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the sewer facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for
all work categories;
      (3)   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance, and replacement
(O, M, and R) costs to each user class by volume, BOD, and SS;
      (4)   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance, and replacement
(O, M, and R) costs to sewer facility categories by volume, SS, and BOD;
      (5)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength; and
      (6)   Compute surcharge costs per pound per 1,000 gallons in excess of
normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   (D)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waste waters exceed the
normal domestic concentrations of BOD 200 mg/l and SS 225 mg/l. The surcharge
will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for
all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 225 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS
respectively (§
54.112 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge).
   (E)   The adequacy of the sewer service charge shall be reviewed, not less
often than annually, by certified public accountants for the village in their
annual audit report. The sewer service charge shall be revised periodically to
reflect a change in operation and maintenance costs, replacement costs, and
Reserve Fund costs.
   (F)   The capital improvement charge is levied on users to provide for
capital improvements, extensions, or reconstruction of the sewage treatment
works. The capital improvement charge is computed by apportioning the annual
amount to be accrued as a charge per 1,000 gallons.
   (G)   The users of sewer treatment services will be notified annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to the sewer treatment operation, maintenance,
and replacement.
(Prior Code, § 38-5-87)
§ 54.146 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   (A)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of 1,000 gallons. If the person discharging wastes into the public
sewer procures any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than
the public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the
public sewer, the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense,
water meters of a type approved by the village for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the approving authority if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, and maintained by the person and owned by the village. Following
approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is
canceled, without the consent of the village.
(Prior Code, § 38-5-88)

Sewer users inside village limits  $11.60              $8.01
Sewer users outside village limits $16.12              $11.76
 
   (B)   The sewer rates contained in this section shall continue to increase
automatically and in proportion to any increases in rates that the Kaskaskia
Water District charges to the village.
   (C)   Of the revenue that is raised from the sewer fees, 2% shall continue
to be placed in a Reserve Fund to be used by the Board of Trustees for future
sewer infrastructure improvements.

   (A)   Authority. The village shall have the authority to collect from the
property owner the costs incurred in performing the property maintenance
activities to abate the nuisances described in the this code of ordinances. The
village shall send a bill for the cost to the property owner, his or her agent,
legal representative, or occupant in legal possession or control of the
premises.
   (B)   Traditional lien procedure. If a bill sent pursuant to division (A)
above is not paid in full within 30 days of the date of the bill, the village
shall have the authority to file and record a lien against the property,
pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15, and as set forth within this code of
ordinances. If any specific procedure is otherwise set forth in this code of
ordiancnes for the activity, said procedure is hereby repealed and the
following procedure shall apply.
      (1)   Notice of lien.
         (a)   The village, or the person performing the service by authority
of the village in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of lien in the
office of the recorder of deeds in the county in which the real estate is
located. The notice of lien shall be filed within one year after the cost and
expense is incurred. If, for any one property, the village engaged in any
nuisance abatement activity described in this chapter on more than one occasion
during the course of one year, then the village may combine any or all of the
costs of those activities into a single notice of lien. The notice of lien
shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth:
            1.   A description of the real estate that sufficiently describes
the parcel;
            2.   The amount of the cost and expense incurred or payable for the
activities; and
            3.   The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by
the village or someone working on behalf of the village.
         (b)   After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified
mail to the property owner, his or her agent or legal representative or
occupant in legal possession or control of the premises and, if different, to
the person who received the tax bill for the preceding year.
      (2)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (3)   Foreclosure of lien. Subsequent to the filing of the above
described lien, the village may cause to be filed a complaint for foreclosure
of such lien, or upon becoming a defendant in a pending lawsuit affecting the
premises or real estate, by answer to the complaint or in the nature of an
intervening petition or cross-complaint the village may proceed in its
corporate name to foreclose such lien. An action to foreclose a lien under this
section must be commenced within two years after the date of filing notice of
lien. The property subject to a lien arising under this subchapter shall be
sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied

this division (C) shall apply to costs incurred for activities performed on
abandoned residential properties, as defined in 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15.1, and is an

lien against the property, pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15.1, in the following
manner.

authority of the village, in its his or her own name, may file a notice of a
priority lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in the county in which the
real estate is located. The notice of lien shall be filed within one year after
the cost and expense is incurred. If, for any one property, the village engaged
in any nuisance abatement activity described in this chapter on more than one
occasion during the course of one year, then the village may combine any or all
of the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien. The notice of
lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth:
         (a)   A description of the abandoned residential property that
sufficiently describes the parcel;
         (b)   The amount of the cost incurred or payable for the activities;
         (c)   The date or dates when such cost was incurred by the village or
someone working on behalf of the village; and
         (d)   1.   A statement that the lien has been filed pursuant to one or
more of the property maintenance activities described in this chapter and
authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7(d), 65 ILCS 5/11-20-8(d), 65 ILCS 5/11-20-12
(d), 65 ILCS 5/11-20-13(e), or 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1.01, as applicable. After
recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified mail to the property
owner, his or her agent, legal representative, or occupant in legal possession
or control of the premises and, if different, to the person who received the
tax bill for the preceding year.
            2.   The village may not file a lien if the lender has provided
notice to the village that the lender has performed, or will perform, remedial
actions; provided, however, that the remedial actions must be performed or
initiated in good faith within 30 days of the lender’s notice to the village.
      (2)   Recordkeeping. To enforce a lien pursuant to this division (C), the
village must maintain contemporaneous records that include, at a minimum:
         (a)   A dated statement of a finding by the village that the property
has become abandoned residential property;
         (b)   The date when the property was first observed to be unoccupied
by any lawful occupant;
         (c)   A description of the actions taken by the village to contact the
legal owner of the property, or if known, any agent of the owner;
         (d)   A statement that no contacts were made with the legal owner or,
if known, any agent of the owner;
         (e)   A dated certification by a village official of the necessity and
specific nature of the work performed;
         (f)   A copy of the agreement with the person or company performing
the work and the rates and estimated cost of the work, if applicable;
         (g)   Detailed invoices and payment vouchers for the work; and
         (h)   A statement whether the work was competitively bid, and if so, a
copy of all proposals submitted by the bidders.
      (3)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (4)   Enforcement of lien. A lien under this division (C) is enforceable
by the village, or entity or person who performs work on behalf of the village,
at the hearing for confirmation of the foreclosure sale of the abandoned
residential property and is limited to a claim of interest in the proceeds of
the sale. The priority lien is superior to all other liens and encumbrances,
except tax liens.

CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITIES IN THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 93.060 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this subchapter, the village intends to exercise
its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use
of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards
to address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without
limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways, and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased storm water run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this subchapter. This subchapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this subchapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired, and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license, or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license, or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this subchapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license, or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license, or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. In the event of any conflict with,
or inconsistency between, the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions
of any franchise, license, or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license, or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other subchapters or chapters. This subchapter
supersedes all subchapters or chapters or parts of subchapters or chapters
adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such
conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
subchapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter
to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or
regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this subchapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this subchapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety, and welfare.

§ 93.064 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Superintendent
within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to
the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Superintendent shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Superintendent is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this subchapter and all
applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Superintendent
shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it
shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent, that the construction proposed under the application shall be
in full compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this subchapter for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation, and not less than 30 days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent shall specify the
portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used, or
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Superintendent fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either ten
days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction, or 25 days
after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this subchapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
93.063, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications, and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) above.
   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007, being 220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq., shall be
deemed granted 45 days after submission to the village, unless otherwise acted
upon by the village, provided the holder has complied with applicable village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-5)
§ 93.065 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on village rights-of-way, and
does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge
upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required.
      (1)   No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this
subchapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and
subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction
meeting.
      (2)   The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time, and
place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance
as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of
reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-6)
§ 93.066 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   (A)   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in
any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings, and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work.
   (B)   The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the
locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the
permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of
this subchapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance
with §
93.080. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-7)
§ 93.067 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance

contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.

cancel or not to renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance.
      (1)   A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) above. A utility that
self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply
with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under division (A)
above, or the requirements of divisions (B), (C), and (D) above.
      (2)   A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) above,
such as evidence that the utility is a private self-insurer under the Workers’
Compensation Act, being 820 ILCS 305/1 et seq.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-“ or better and of a class
size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-8)
§ 93.068 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents, and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs
of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from, or alleged to arise out of
or result from the negligent, careless, or wrongful acts, omissions, failures
to act, or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors, or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this subchapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses, or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct, or breach of this
subchapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents, or
representatives.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-9)
§ 93.069 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve a security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this subchapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits, and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
subchapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this subchapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this subchapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this subchapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this paragraph shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount.
      (1)   The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Superintendent, and may also include reasonable,
directly-related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration.
      (2)   Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will
be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase
consisting of construction of facilities in one location or related group of
locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
Superintendent may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single-amount of security, which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund; provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs, or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) above.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund; be returned to the permittee by the
village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that
any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance
required in division (C) above.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund.
      (1)   Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion
thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken
for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the
permittee to comply with any provisions of this subchapter or other applicable
law.
      (2)   In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund,
and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the
village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage
incurred by the village as a result of said revocation; provided that any
amounts in excess of said costs, loss, or damage shall be refunded to the
permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding, or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall
affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

§ 93.071 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP, IDENTITY, OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the village no less
than 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-

be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-12)

(Prior Code, § 33-4-14)
§ 93.074 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this section.
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Superintendent determines that the
proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village’s utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 meters) behind the face
of the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 meters) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
meters) of the right-of-way line, or as near as possible to the right-of-way
line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 meters) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 meters) from the right-of-way line, and any
abovegrounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 meters) of the
right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90-degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or

maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. § 192.707).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   Location restricted. The village may restrict the location and size
of any freestanding facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   Screening. The village may require any freestanding facility
located within a right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed aboveground. Aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   Individual. No other existing facilities in the area are located
underground;
      (2)   Tactically feasible. New underground installation is not
technically feasible; and
      (3)   Suitable design. The proposed installation will be made at a
location, and will employ suitable design and materials, to provide the
greatest protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without
adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to,
self-supporting, armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration
of conductors and cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be
used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is
strongly discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Installation risk. Facilities may be installed as attachments to
bridges or roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all
other means of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means
shall include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent
poles, cable supports, and tower supports, all of which are completely
separated from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting
commodities that are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially
those under significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk,
and such installations are not permitted.
      (2)   Approval or disapproval. A utility shall include in its request to
accommodate a facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting
data demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or
disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure, or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards. The village may prohibit the installation of
facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality. A
facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require extensive
removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the right-of-way
user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it does not impair
the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-15)
§ 93.075 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods.
      (1)   Boring or jacking.

minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only one-half of
any intersection may have an open trench at any time, unless special permission
is obtained from the Superintendent.
         (b)   Open trench and wind rowed excavated material shall be protected
as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices. Where practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between
the roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be
allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width
does not allow for wind rowing excavated material off the paved portion of the
roadway, excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   The utility shall not trench within the drip line of any tree
designated by the village to be preserved.
      (3)   Back-filling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be back- filled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for back-fill, suitable granular back-fill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any back-filled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If
so ordered by the Superintendent, the utility, at its expense, shall remove any
pavement and back-fill material to the top of the installed facility, place and
properly compact new back-fill material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk,
curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the Superintendent.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be discouraged, but may be permitted only upon location specific approval
by the Superintendent, and only if that portion of the roadway is closed to
traffic.
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be back-filled and
compacted as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10
gradation, as designated by the Superintendent.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a Common
Ground Alliance locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 meters) of the right-of-way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided
and maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for
minimum cover for the type of facility:
 
Type of Facility                         Minimum Cover

and Communications Lines,” and the National Electrical Safety Code.
         (b)   Overhead power or communication facilities shall use single pole
construction and, where practicable, joint use of poles shall be used.
Utilities shall make every reasonable effort to design the installation so guys
and braces will not be needed. Variances may be allowed if there is no feasible
alternative and if guy wires are equipped with guy guards for maximum
visibility.
         (c)   For underground facilities, cable may be installed by trenching
or plowing; provided that special consideration is given to boring in order to
minimize damage when crossing improved entrances and side roads.
            1.   If a crossing is installed by boring or jacking, encasement
shall be provided between jacking or bore pits. Encasement may be eliminated
only if:
               a.   The crossing is installed by the use of moles, whip augers,
or other approved method which compress the earth to make the opening for cable
installation; or
               b.   The installation is by the open trench-method which is only
permitted prior to roadway construction.
            2.   Cable shall be grounded in accordance with the National
Electrical Safety Code.
            3.   All temporary service drops placed between November 1 of the
prior year and March 15 of the current year, also known as snowdrops, shall be
buried by May 31 of the current year, weather permitting, unless otherwise
permitted by the village. Weather permitting, utilities shall bury all
temporary drops, excluding snowdrops, within ten business days after placement.
      (2)   Underground facilities other than electric power or communication
lines. Underground facilities other than electric power or communication lines
may be installed by:

within rights-of-way shall be those meeting the accepted standards of the
appropriate industry, the applicable portions of IDOT’s Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction, the requirements of the State Commerce
Commission, or the standards established by other official regulatory agencies
for the appropriate industry.
      (2)   Material storage on right-of-way. No material shall be stored on
the rights-of-way without the prior written approval of the Superintendent.
When such storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross arms, or
other materials shall be distributed along the rights-of-way prior to and
during installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public, an obstacle
to rights-of-way maintenance, or damage to the right-of-way and other property.
If material is to be stored on rights-of-way, prior approval must be obtained
from the village.
      (3)   Hazardous materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the
village shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the
construction of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
   (D)   Operational restrictions. Construction operations on rights-of-way
may, at the discretion of the village, be required to be discontinued when such
operations would create hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and
welfare. Such operations may also be required to be discontinued or restricted
when conditions are such that construction would result in extensive damage to
the right-of-way or other property. These restrictions may be waived by the
Superintendent when emergency work is required to restore vital utility
services. Unless otherwise permitted by the village, the hours of construction
are from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
   (E)   Location of existing facilities.
      (1)   Any utility proposing to construct facilities in the village shall
contact Common Ground Alliance and ascertain the presence and location of
existing aboveground and underground facilities within the rights-of-way to be
occupied by its proposed facilities.
      (2)   The village will make its permit record available to a utility for
the purpose of identifying possible facilities. When notified of an excavation
or when requested by the village or by Common Ground Alliance, a utility shall
locate and physically mark its underground facilities within 48 hours,
excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance with the State Underground
Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.).
(Prior Code, § 33-4-16) Penalty, see §
10.999
§ 93.076 VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Electric utilities; compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and, additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities; tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable state laws and regulations specifically
governing the same shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this subchapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers, with supervision, who are experienced in accepted tree
pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in
the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated, and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side-
arm extensions, covered wire, or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use. Except as provided in §
93.077, no utility shall spray, inject, or pour any chemicals on or near any
trees, shrubs, or vegetation in the village for any purpose, including the
control of growth, insects, or disease. Spraying of any type of brush-killing
chemicals will not be permitted on rights-of-way, unless the utility
demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that such spraying is
the only practicable method of vegetation control.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-17) Penalty, see §
10.999
§ 93.077 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATION OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change, or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change, or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this subchapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate,
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility, and shall notify the utility,
if known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities.
      (1)   Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the
village, the utility shall notify the village within 90 days.
      (2)   Following receipt of such notice, the village may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility, if the Superintendent
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety, and welfare.
      (3)   In the event that the village does not direct the utility that
abandoned the facility to remove it by giving notice of abandonment to the
village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.

§ 93.079 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades, or flags. If a hazard does not
exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
are available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Superintendent or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
village police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file, in writing, with the village
a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours
after an emergency repair.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-20)
§ 93.080 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this subchapter must do so in writing to the
Superintendent as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this subchapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Superintendent shall decide whether
a variance is authorized for each provision of this subchapter identified in
the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Superintendent may authorize
a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations, or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Superintendent may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this subchapter, but which carry out the purposes of
this subchapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal.
      (1)   Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision, or
determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Superintendent under
the provisions of this subchapter shall have the right to appeal to the Board
of Trustees, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted, in writing, to the Village Clerk
within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision, or
determination.

appeal at the Board of Trustees’ next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at

timely decide the appeal.

   (A)   (1)   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses
to comply with any of the provisions of this subchapter shall be subject to a
fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this code of ordinances.
There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including
third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties
under its permit and this subchapter.
      (2)   Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit.
      (3)   No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule
a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed
upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. See §
10.999 for additional penalties.
(Prior Code, § 33-4-22)

finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole
do not comply with the applicable codes or local code provisions or regulations
in LICENSOR’S Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Ordinance, as now or
hereafter amended. If P.A. 100-0585 is repealed as provided in Section 90 of
the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act, being 50 ILCS 840/90, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the LICENSOR’S code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
8)   EXTENSIONS. Each Supplement may be extended for additional five (5) year
terms unless LICENSEE terminates it at the end of the then current term by
giving LICENSOR written notice of the intent to terminate at least three (3)
months prior to the end of the then current term. The initial term and all
extensions under a Supplement shall be collectively referred to herein as the
“Term”. Notwithstanding anything herein, after the expiration of this
Agreement, its terms and conditions shall survive and govern with respect to
any remaining Supplements in effect until their expiration or termination.
9)   RENTAL. Each Supplement shall be effective as of the date of execution by
both Parties (the “Effective Date”), provided, however, the initial term of
each Supplement shall be for five (5) years and shall commence on the first day
of the month following the day that LICENSEE commences installation of the
equipment on the Premises (the “Commencement Date”) at which time rental
payments shall commence and be due at a total annual rental as set forth in the
Supplement, to be paid in advance annually on the Commencement Date and on each
anniversary of it in advance, to the LICENSOR in the Supplement (unless LESSOR
otherwise designates another payee and provides notice to LICENSEE). LICENSOR
and LICENSEE acknowledge and agree that the initial rental payment for each
Supplement shall not actually be sent by LICENSEE until thirty (30) days after
the Commencement Date. LICENSOR and LICENSEE agree that they shall acknowledge
in writing the Commencement Date of each Supplement. Rental for the use of any
poles pursuant to this Agreement, shall be an annual fee of $200.00 per each
wireless facility which LICENSEE attaches to LICENSOR’S pole. Thereafter, rent
will be due at each annual anniversary of the “Commencement Date” of the
applicable Supplement. Upon agreement of the Parties, LICENSEE may pay rent by
electronic funds transfer and in such event, LICENSOR agrees to provide to
LICENSEE bank routing information for such purpose upon request of LICENSEE.
10)   ABANDONMENT. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The Village may
send written inquiry to the wireless service provider inquiring whether any
small wireless facility is in operation and, if it is not in operation, inquire
of the last date upon which the small wireless facility was in operation. If
the wireless service provider fails to respond to the Village’s written inquiry
within 90 days from the receipt of the written inquiry, the Village may deem
that such small wireless facility has not operated for a continuous period of
12 months. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility
within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
Any notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells or
transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider.
11)   CONDITION OF PREMISES. Where the Premises includes one or more Poles,
LICENSOR covenants that it will keep the Poles in good repair as required by
all federal, state, county, and local laws. If the LICENSOR fails to make such
repairs including maintenance within 60 days, of any notification to LICENSOR,
the LICENSEE shall have the right to cease annual rental for the effected
poles, but only if the poles are no longer capable of being used for the
purpose originally contemplated in this Agreement or otherwise do not comply
with existing law. If LICENSEE terminates, LICENSEE shall remove its small
wireless facility. Termination of this Agreement shall be the LICENSEE’S sole
remedy.
12)   MAKE READY TERMS. LICENSOR shall not require more make-ready work than
required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Make-ready work may
include work needed to accommodate additional public safety communications
needs that are identified in a documented and approved plan for the deployment
of public safety equipment as specified and included in an existing or
preliminary LICENSOR or public service agency plan. Fees for make-ready work,
including any LICENSOR utility pole attachment, shall not exceed actual costs
or the amount charged to communications service providers for similar work and
shall not include any consultants’ fees or expenses for LICENSOR utility poles
that do not support aerial facilities used to provide communications services
or electric service. Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, shall be
completed within 60 days of written acceptance of the good-faith estimate by
the LICENSOR at the LICENEE’s sole cost and expense.
13)   AERIAL FACILITIES. For LICENSOR utility poles that support aerial
facilities used to provide communications services or electric services,
LICENSEE shall comply with the process for makeready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224
and its implementing regulations. LICENSOR shall follow a substantially similar
process for such make-ready work except to the extent that the timing
requirements are otherwise addressed in LICENSOR’S Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Ordinance, as now or hereafter amended. The good-faith estimate of
the person owning or controlling LICENSOR’S utility pole for any make-ready
work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation shall
include LICENSOR utility pole replacement, if necessary. Make-ready work for
utility poles that support aerial facilities used to provide communications
services or electric services may include reasonable consultants’ fees and
expenses.
14)   NO AERIAL FACILITIES. For LICENSOR utility poles that do not support
aerial facilities used to provide communications services or electric services,
LICENSOR shall provide a good-faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary
to enable the LICENSOR utility pole to support the requested collocation,
include pole replacement, if necessary, within 90 days after receipt of a
complete application. Make-ready work, including any LICENSOR utility pole
replacement, shall be completed within 60 days of written acceptance of the
good-faith estimate by LICENSEE at LICENSEE’s-sole cost and expense.
Alternatively, if LICENSOR determines that applicable codes or public safety
regulations require the LICENSOR’S utility pole to be replaced to support the
requested collocation, LICENSOR may require LICENSEE to replace LICENSOR’S
utility pole at LICENSEE’S sole cost and expense.
15)   GENERAL RESTRICTIONS. In the event LICENSOR, in its reasonable discretion
deems it necessary to remove, relocate or replace a Pole, LICENSOR shall notify
LICENSEE at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior of the need to remove or
relocate its small wireless facility. In such event, LICENSOR shall provide
options for alternative locations for LICENSEE relocation of equipment which
shall be in a mutually agreeable location (“Alternative Premises”). LICENSEE
shall be solely responsible for all costs related to the relocation of its
small wireless facility to the Alternative Premises. In the event that a
suitable Alternative Premises cannot be identified, LICENSEE may terminate the
applicable Supplement. In the event of an emergency, which for purposes of this
Agreement shall be considered any imminent threat to health, safety, and
welfare of the public, LICENSOR must provide as much notice as reasonably
practical under the circumstances. LICENSEE may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to the other party specifying the date of termination,
such notice to be given not less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to
the date specified therein.
16)   ELECTRICAL. LICENSEE shall be permitted to connect its equipment to
necessary electrical and telephone service, at LICENSEE’S expense. LICENSEE
shall attempt to coordinate with utility companies to provide separate service
to LICENSEE’S equipment for LICENSEE use. In the event that LICENSEE can obtain
separate electrical service with a separate meter measuring usage, the LICENSEE
shall pay the utility directly for its power consumption, if billed directly by
the utility. In the event that separate electrical service is not possible or
practical under the circumstances, LICENSEE may use existing service, at
LICENSEE’S expense, upon the reasonable approval of LICENSOR. In the event that
LICENSEE uses existing utility service at an individual Premises, the Parties
agree to either: (i) attempt to have a sub-meter installed, at LICENSEE’S
expense, which shall monitor LICENSEE’S utility usage (with a reading and
subsequent bill for usage delivered to LICENSEE by either the applicable
utility company or LICENSOR); or (ii) provide for an additional fee in the
applicable Supplement which shall cover LICENSEE’S utility usage. The Parties
agree to reflect power usage and measurement issues in each applicable
Supplement.
17)   TEMPORARY POWER. LICENSEE shall be permitted at any time during the Term
of each Supplement, to install, maintain, and/or provide access to and use of,
as necessary (during any power interruption at the Premises), a temporary power
source, and all related equipment and appurtenances within the Premises, or
elsewhere on the Property in such locations as reasonably approved by LICENSOR.
LICENSEE shall be permitted to connect the temporary power source to its
equipment on the Premises in areas and manner approved by LICENSOR.
18)   USE; GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. LICENSEE shall use the Premises for the
purpose of constructing, maintaining, repairing, and operating small wireless
facilities and uses incidental thereto. LICENSEE shall have the right to
replace, repair, and modify equipment, antennas, and/or conduits or any portion
thereof and the frequencies over which the equipment operates, in conformance
with the original Supplement. It is understood and agreed that LICENSEE’S
ability to use the Premises is contingent upon its obtaining after the
execution date of each Supplement all of the certificates, permits and other
approvals (collectively the “Governmental Approvals”) that may be required by
any Federal, State, or Local authorities as well as a satisfactory building
structural analysis which will permit LICENSEE use of the Premises as set forth
above. In the event, that (i) any of such applications for such Governmental
Approvals should be finally rejected; (ii) any Governmental Approval issued to
LICENSEE is canceled, expires, lapses, or is otherwise withdrawn or terminated
by governmental authority; and (iii) LICENSEE determines that such Governmental
Approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, LICENSEE shall have the right
to terminate the applicable Supplement. Notice of LICENSEE’S exercise of its
right to terminate shall be given to LICENSOR in accordance with the notice
provisions set forth herein and shall be effective upon the mailing of such
notice by LICENSEE, or upon such later date as designated by LICENSEE. All
rentals paid to said termination date shall be retained by LICENSOR. Upon such
termination, the applicable Supplement shall be of no further force or effect
except to the extent of the representations, warranties and indemnities made by
each Party to the other thereunder. Otherwise, the LICENSEE shall have no
further obligations for the payment of rent to LICENSOR for the terminated
Supplement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph,
LICENSEE shall continue to be liable for all rental payments to the LICENSOR
until all equipment is removed from the Property.
19)   INSURANCE. LICENSEE shall carry, at LICENSEE’S own cost and expense,
insurance meeting the requirements specified in the LICENSOR’S Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Ordinance.
20)   INDEMNIFICATION. LICENSEE shall indemnify and hold LICENSOR harmless
against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage
resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of
LICENSOR’S improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by
LICENSEE or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted1 under this Agreement and PA 100-0585. LICENSEE has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of LICENSOR or its employees or
agents. LICENSEE hereby further waives any claims that LICENSEE may have
against the LICENSOR with respect to consequential, incidental, or special
damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability.
21)   REMOVAL AT END OF TERM. LICENSEE shall, upon expiration of the Term, or
within ninety (90) days after any earlier termination of a Supplement, remove
its equipment, conduits, fixtures, and all personal property and restore the
Premises to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear, and casualty
damage not caused by LICENSEE excepted. LICENSOR agrees and acknowledges that
all of the equipment, conduits, fixtures, and personal property of LICENSEE
shall remain the persona] property of LICENSEE and LICENSEE shall have the
right to remove the same at any time during the Term, whether or not said items
are considered fixtures and attachments to real property under applicable laws.
If such time for removal causes LICENSEE to remain on the Premises after
termination of the Supplement, LICENSEE shall pay rent at the then existing
monthly rate or on the existing monthly pro-rata basis if based upon a longer
payment term, until such time as the removal of the antenna structure, fixtures
and all personal property are completed.
22)   RIGHTS UPON SALE. Should LICENSOR, at any time during the Term of any
Supplement decide to sell or transfer all or any part of the Property such sale
or grant of an easement or interest therein shall be under and subject to the
Supplement and any such purchaser or transferee shall recognize LICENSEE’S
rights hereunder and under the terms of the Supplement.
23)   NOTICES. All notices hereunder must be in writing and shall be deemed

§ 132.060 OFFENSE DEFINED.

knowledge of the nature or content thereof or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he or she:
      (1)   Sells, delivers, provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver, or
provide any obscene writing, picture, record, or other representation or
embodiment of the obscene;

      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene defined. A thing is OBSCENE if, considered as a whole, its
predominant appeal is to prurient interest; that is, shameful or morbid
interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond
customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters, a
thing is OBSCENE even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of
undeveloped photographs.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
         (c)   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other merits
of the material, or the absence thereof;
         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in the
state;
         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest or absence thereof in advertising or
other promotion of the material; and
         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plat, or other embodiment or obscenity,
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
(Prior Code, § 27-8-1)
§ 132.061 HARMFUL MATERIAL.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person who, with knowledge that a person is

reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly distributes
to, or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to or offers to distribute or
exhibit any harmful material to a child is guilty of a violation of this code
of ordinances.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DISTRIBUTE. To transfer possession of material whether with or without
consideration.
      HARMFUL. Material is HARMFUL if, to the average person applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest; that is, shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or
excretion which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters and is material, the redeeming
social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
      KNOWINGLY. Having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter or
recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed
the contents thereof.
      MATERIAL. Any writing, picture, record, or other representation or
embodiment.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall
be judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the
child to whom such material was offered, distributed, sent, or exhibited,
unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its
dissemination, distribution, or exhibition that it is designed for specially
susceptible groups, in which case, the predominant appeal of the material shall
be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
      (2)   In prosecutions under this section where circumstances of
production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity,
indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of
the material is, in fact, substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   (D)   Affirmative defenses.
      (1)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years of age; provided such

educational purposes.

to his or her child any harmful material.
      (3)   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown, and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: a document issued by
the federal government or any state, county, or municipal government, or
subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle
operator’s license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal
Selective Service Act, being 50 U.S.C. App. § 453, or an identification card
issued to a member of the armed forces.
      (4)   In the event an advertisement of harmful material, as defined in
this section, culminates in the sale or distribution of such harmful material
to a child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of
the child by the defendant, his or her employees or agents as where the order
or request for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or
similar means of communication and delivery of such harmful material to the
child was by mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a
defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the
advertisement contained the following statement or a statement substantially
similar thereto, and that the defendant required the purchaser to certify that
he or she was not under the age of 18 years and that the purchaser falsely
stated that he or she was not under the age of 18 years:
“NOTICE: It is unlawful for any person under eighteen (18) years of age to
purchase the matter herein advertised. Any person under eighteen (18) years of
age who falsely states that he is not under eighteen (18) years of age for the
purpose of obtaining the material advertised herein is guilty of a
misdemeanor.”
   (E)   Child falsifying age. Any person under 18 years of age who falsely
states, either orally or in writing, that he or she is not under the age of 18

which is false or not actually his or her own for the purpose of ordering,
obtaining, viewing, or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as “the Property Maintenance Code of the Village
of Marissa,” hereinafter referred to as “this Code” or “this chapter.”
(101.1) (Prior Code, § 29-1-1)
§ 150.002 SCOPE; SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   (1)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all existing
residential and nonresidential structures and all existing premises and
constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures,
equipment, and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation,
protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards,
and for safe and sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators,
and occupants; the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for
administration, enforcement, and penalties.
(101.2)
      (2)   (a)   This section establishes the broad purpose of this chapter:
to protect the public health, safety and welfare in both existing residential
and nonresidential structures and on all existing premises.
Four specific areas are addressed in greater detail in subsequent sections:
            1.   Establishing minimum maintenance standards for such elements
as basic equipment, light, ventilation, heating, sanitation, and fire safety;
            2.   Fixing responsibility among owners, operators, and occupants
for following this chapter;
            3.   Regulating the use of existing structures and premises; and
            4.   Providing for administration, enforcement, and penalties.
         (b)   These four categories provide communities with the tools to
reduce risks created by deteriorated or unsafe buildings and help communities
upgrade and maintain other existing structures.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-2)
   (B)   (1)   If a section, division, sentence, clause, or phrase of the
chapter is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.
(101.4)
      (2)   Only invalid sections of this chapter (as established by the court
of jurisdiction) can be set aside. This is essential to safeguard the
application of this chapter text to situations whereby a provision of this
chapter is declared illegal or unconstitutional. This section would preserve
the legislative action that put the legal provisions in place.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-4)
§ 150.003 INTENT.
   (A)   This chapter shall be construed to secure its expressed intent, which
is to ensure public health, safety, and welfare insofar as they are affected by
the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. Existing
structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be
altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required
herein. Repairs, alterations, additions to, and change of occupancy in existing
buildings shall comply with the International Existing Building Code.
(101.3)
   (B)   This chapter is intended to provide requirements addressing the public
health, safety, and welfare as they relate to the use and maintenance of
existing structures and premises. This chapter requires existing structures and
premises that are not in compliance with this chapter to be altered or repaired
to meet the International Existing Building Code. The International Existing
Building Code requirements are intended to represent the minimum acceptable
level of public health and safety. The International Existing Building Code®
(IEBC®) is listed as the required code for all repairs, alterations, additions,
and change of occupancies to existing structures.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-3)
§ 150.004 APPLICABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all matters affecting or
relating to structures and premises, as set forth in §§
150.001 through
150.003. Where, in a specific case, different sections of this chapter specify
different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
(102.1) (Prior Code, § 29-1-5)
   (B)   (1)   Equipment, systems, devices, and safeguards required by this
chapter or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or premises
was constructed, altered, or repaired shall be maintained in good working
order. No owner, operator, or occupant shall cause any service, facility,
equipment, or utility which is required under this division (B) to be removed
from or shut-off from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except for
such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are in
progress.
      (2)   The requirements of this chapter are not intended to provide the
basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and
devices in existing structures. Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner
or the owner’s designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of
buildings, structures, and premises.
(102.2)
      (3)   This division (B) contains general maintenance requirements. The
International Existing Building Code specifically prohibits the disconnection
of any required utilities for an occupied dwelling. This helps to safeguard
persons who have a physical condition and are dependent on these systems. Some
examples of this include: a person who has to have electricity to power a
kidney dialysis machine; a patient who is on an oxygen system full-time; or
someone with particularly bad allergies who needs to have an air conditioning
system to help filter the air. Any safety system that exists in a building must
be maintained.
      (4)   A fire protection or safety system is not to be removed from a
building if it is required by this chapter or a previous regulation or code
that was in effect when the building was built, this section also specifies
that the owner or the owner’s agent is responsible for maintenance, not the
tenants of rental property.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-6)
   (C)   Repairs, additions, or alterations to a structure, or changes of
occupancy, shall be done in accordance with the procedures and provisions of
the International Existing Building Code. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to cancel, modify, or set aside any provision of the International
Zoning Code.
(102.3) (Prior Code, § 29-1-7)
   (D)   The provision in this chapter shall not be construed to abolish or
impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies
relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous,
unsafe, and unsanitary.
(102.4) (Prior Code, § 29-1-8)
   (E)   Repairs, maintenance work, alterations, or installations which are
caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this chapter shall be
executed and installed in a workmanlike manner and installed in accordance with
the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
(102.5) (Prior Code, § 29-1-9)
   (F)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be mandatory for existing
buildings or structures designated as historic buildings when such buildings or
structures are judged by the Code Enforcement Officer to be safe and in the
public interest of health, safety, and welfare.
(102.6) (Prior Code, § 29-1-10)
   (G)   The codes and standards referenced in this chapter shall be those that
are listed in §
150.022(U) through (Y) and considered part of the requirements of this chapter
to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where differences occur
between provisions of this chapter and the referenced standards, the provisions
of this chapter shall apply.
(102.7) (Prior Code, § 29-1-11)
   (H)   Requirements necessary for the strength, stability or proper operation
of an existing fixture, structure or equipment, or for the public safety,
health, and general welfare not specifically covered by this chapter shall be
determined by the Code Enforcement Officer.
(102.8) (Prior Code, § 29-1-12)
   (I)   Any repair, alteration, or replacement of a structure, structural
elements, or equipment in a building which may be required by the provisions of
this chapter shall be done in accordance with the applicable sections of the
Building Code, Electrical Code, Plumbing Code, or other applicable codes or
ordinances of the village, if any.
(Prior Code, § 29-10-1)
   (J)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be utilized or construed to
permit the abridgement or violation of the Zoning Code.
(Prior Code, § 29-10-2)
   (K)   Specific provisions of this chapter take precedence over and prevail
over any other provisions of other codes or ordinances in conflict herewith.
(Prior Code, § 29-10-3)
   (L)   This chapter shall be construed liberally and justly to ensure public
health, safety, and welfare insofar as they are affected by the maintenance of
structures and premises.
(Prior Code, § 29-10-4)
   (M)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to prevent the
enforcement of other codes or ordinances or regulations which prescribe
standards other than those provided for herein.
(Prior Code, § 29-10-5)
   (N)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to abolish or
impair existing remedies of the village or its officers or agencies relating to
the removal or demolition of any building which is deemed to be dangerous,
unsafe, or unsanitary.
(Prior Code, § 29-10-6)

§ 150.006 CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall enforce the provisions of this
chapter.
(104.1) (Prior Code, § 29-1-21)
   (B)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall have authority as necessary in the
interest of public health, safety, and general welfare, to adopt and promulgate
rules and procedures; to interpret and implement the provisions of this
chapter; to secure the intent thereof; and to designate requirements applicable
because of local climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not have the
effect of waiving structural or fire performance requirements specifically
provided for in this chapter, or of violating accepted engineering methods
involving public safety.
(104.2) (Prior Code, § 29-1-22)
   (C)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall make all of the required
inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or
individuals. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing and be
certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the
responsible individual. The Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to engage
such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues
that arise, subject to the approval of the appointing authority.
(104.3) (Prior Code, § 29-1-23)
   (D)   (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to enter the
structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect subject to constitutional
restrictions on unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not
obtained, the Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to pursue recourse as
provided by law.
(104.4)
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer must have access to a premises so a
proper inspection can be made. If the Code Enforcement Officer does not have
access, then another inspection must be scheduled.
      (3)   This division (D) establishes the right of the Code Enforcement
Officer to enter the premises in order to make the inspections required by
division (C) above. The right to enter structures or premises is limited to
protect the right of privacy, the owner or occupant must grant the Code
Enforcement Officer permission before an interior inspection of the property
can be conducted. Permission is not required for inspections that can be
accomplished from within the public right-of-way.
         (b)   Such access may be denied by the owner or occupant.
         (c)   The Code Enforcement Officer must present proper identification
and request admittance during reasonable hours (usually the normal business
hours of the establishment) to be admitted.
         (d)   Inspections must be aimed at securing or determining compliance
with the provisions and intent of the regulations that are specifically within
the established scope of the Code Enforcement Officer’s authority.
      (4)   (a)   Many jurisdictions do not recognize the concept of an
administrative warrant and may require the Code Enforcement Officer to prove
probable or reasonable cause in order to gain access upon refusal. This burden
of proof is usually more substantial, often requiring the Code Enforcement
Officer to stipulate in advance why access is needed (usually access is
restricted to gathering evidence for seeking an indictment or making an
arrest), what specific items or information is sought, its relevance to the
case against the individual subject, how knowledge of the relevance of the
information or items sought was obtained and how the evidence sought will be
used.
         (b)   In all such cases, the right to privacy must always be weighed
against the right of the Code Enforcement Officer to conduct an inspection to
verify that the public health, safety, and welfare are not in jeopardy. Such
important and complex constitutional issues should be discussed with the
jurisdiction’s legal counsel. Jurisdictions should establish procedures for
securing the necessary court orders when an inspection is deemed necessary
following a refusal.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-24)
   (E)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall carry proper identification when
inspecting structures or premises in the performance of duties under this
chapter.
(104.5) (Prior Code, § 29-1-25)
   (F)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall issue all necessary notices or
orders to ensure compliance with this chapter.
(104.6) (Prior Code, § 29-1-26)
   (G)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall keep official records of all
business and activities of the department specified in the provisions of this
chapter. Such records shall be retained in the official records as long as the
building or structure to which such records relate remains in existence, unless
otherwise provided for by other regulations.
(104.7) (Prior Code, § 29-1-27)
   (H)   Whenever in the enforcement of this chapter or another code or
ordinance, the responsibility of more than one code official of the
jurisdiction is involved, it shall be the duty of the code officials involved
to coordinate their inspections and administrative orders as fully as
practicable so that the owners and occupants of the structure shall not be
subjected to visits by numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders.
Whenever an inspector from any agency or department observes an apparent or
actual violation of some provision of some law, ordinance, or code not within
the inspector’s authority to enforce, the inspector shall report the findings
to the Code Enforcement Officer having jurisdiction.
(104.8) (Prior Code, § 29-1-28)

shall be deemed a separate offense.
(106.4) (Prior Code, § 29-1-38)
   (E)   (1)   The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed shall not
preclude the legal officer of the jurisdiction from instituting appropriate
action to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal
occupancy of a building, structure, or premises, or to stop an illegal act,
conduct, business, or utilization of the building, structure, or premises.
(106.5)
      (2)   Despite the assessment of a penalty in the form of a fine against a
violator, the violation itself must still be corrected. Failure to make the
necessary corrections will result in the violator being subject to additional
penalties as described in division (D) above.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-39)
   (F)   (1)   In addition to any other method authorized by law, if:

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
§ 150.020 APPROVAL.
   (A)    Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out
the provisions of this chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer shall have the
authority to grant modifications for individual cases; provided the Code
Enforcement Officer shall first find that special individual reason makes the
strict letter of this chapter impractical, and the modification is in
compliance with the intent and purpose of this chapter, and that such
modification does not lessen health, life, and fire safety requirements. The
details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the
department files.
(105.1) (Prior Code, § 29-1-30)
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are not intended to prevent the
installation of any material or to prohibit any method of construction not
specifically prescribed by this chapter; provided that any such alternative has
been approved. An alternative material or method of construction shall be
approved where the Code Enforcement Officer finds that the proposed design is
satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this chapter,
and that the material, method, or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at
least the equivalent of that prescribed in this chapter in quality, strength,
effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, and safety.
(105.2) (Prior Code, § 29-1-31)
   (C)   Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the
provisions of this Code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform
to the requirements of this Code, or in order to substantiate claims for
alternative materials or methods, the Code Enforcement Officer shall have the
authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense
to the jurisdiction.
(105.3)
      (1)   Test methods shall be as specified in this chapter or by other
recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test
methods, the Code Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to approve appropriate
testing procedures performed by an approved agency.
(105.3.1)
      (2)   Reports of tests shall be retained by the Code Enforcement Officer
for the period required for retention of public records.
(105.3.2)
(Prior Code, § 29-1-32)
   (D)   Materials, equipment, and devices shall not be reused unless such
elements are in good repair or have been reconditioned and tested when
necessary, placed in good and proper working condition, and approved.
(105.4) (Prior Code, § 29-1-33)
§ 150.021 NOTICES AND ORDERS.
   (A)    Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer determines that there has been
a violation of this chapter or has grounds to believe that a violation has
occurred, notice shall be given in the manner prescribed in divisions (B) and
(C) below to the person responsible for the violation as specified in this
chapter. Notices for condemnation procedures shall also comply with §
150.022(C).
(107.1) (Prior Code, § 29-1-41)
   (B)   Such notice prescribed in division (A) above shall be in accordance
with all of the following:
      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;
      (3)   Include a statement of the violation or violations and why the
notice is being issued;
      (4)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable time to make the
repairs and improvements required to bring the dwelling unit or structure into
compliance with the provisions of this chapter;
      (5)   Inform the occupant of the right to appeal. In the event that no
one is occupying the property at the time of the violation, then the owner of
the real estate shall be informed of said right to appeal; and
      (6)   Include a statement of the right to file a lien in accordance with
§
150.008(C).
(107.2) (Prior Code, § 29-1-42)
   (C)   Such notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof
is:
      (1)   Delivered personally;
      (2)   Sent by certified or first-class mail addressed to the last known
address; or
      (3)   If the notice is returned showing that the letter was not
delivered, a copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about
the structure affected by such notice.
(107.3) (Prior Code, § 29-1-43)
   (D)   Penalties for noncompliance with orders and notices shall be as set
forth in §
150.008(D).
(107.4) (Prior Code, § 29-1-44)
   (E)   (1)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling unit or
structure who has received a compliance order or upon whom a notice of
violation has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease, or otherwise
dispose of such dwelling unit or structure to another until the provisions of
the compliance order or notice of violation have been complied with, or until
such owner shall first furnish the grantee, transferee, mortgagee, or lessee a
true copy of any compliance order or notice of violation issued by the Code
Enforcement Officer and shall furnish to the Code Enforcement Officer a signed
and notarized statement from the grantee, transferee, mortgagee, or lessee
acknowledging the receipt of such compliance order or notice of violation and
fully accepting the responsibility without condition for making the corrections
or repairs required by such compliance order or notice of violation.
(107.5)
      (2)   When a property has a pending violation order, it is unlawful for
an owner to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the
property without either following the order or advising the buyer, mortgagee,
or the like, of the pending violation. The owner must prove that the buyer has
received notice of pending violations by providing the Code Enforcement Officer
with a signed, notarized receipt from the new transferee.
      (3)   Determining who is the current owner of a building is a frustrating
and difficult activity. To evade code enforcement action, owners will
frequently transfer ownership of their property. This provision of the chapter
permits the Code Enforcement Officer to cite the seller if he or she did not
provide the Code Enforcement Officer with the required notification when the
property was transferred; thus, even though the seller may avoid complying with
the outstanding violation orders, he or she can still be charged with a
violation for failing to provide proof that the transferee was aware of the
pending orders.

(Ord. 16-05, passed 6-6-2016) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.022 UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   When a structure or equipment is found by the Code
Enforcement Officer to be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for human
occupancy, or is found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter.
(108.1)
         (b)   This section provides a brief description of conditions where
the Code Enforcement Officer is given the authority to condemn an existing
structure or equipment. Where a structure or equipment is “unlawful,” as
described in the text of this section, that structure or equipment does not
comply with the requirements of this chapter. The deficiencies are such that an
unsafe condition or a condition that is unfit for human occupancy exists.
      (2)   An unsafe structure is one that is found to be dangerous to the
life, health, property, or safety of the public or the occupants of the
structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or warn occupants in
the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe equipment or is so
damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe, or of such faulty
construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete collapse is
possible.
(108.1.1)
      (3)   Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating equipment, elevator,
moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable liquid containers, or
other equipment on the premises or within the structure which is in such
disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to life, health,
property, or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or structure.
(108.1.2)
      (4)   A structure is unfit for human occupancy whenever the Code
Enforcement Officer finds that such structure is unsafe, unlawful, or, because
of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is
unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks
ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating facilities, or other essential
equipment required by this chapter, or because the location of the structure
constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure or to the public.
(108.1.3)
      (5)   (a)   An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be
occupied by more persons than permitted under this chapter, or was erected,
altered, or occupied contrary to law.
(108.1.4)
         (b)   An unlawful structure is one that has serious deficiencies such
that an unsafe condition or a condition that is unfit for human occupancy
exists. An unlawful structure does not mean one where there are criminal
activities.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-47)
   (B)   If the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and
occupancy, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the Code Enforcement
Officer is authorized to post a placard of condemnation on the premises and
order the structure closed up so as not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon
failure of the owner to close up the premises within the time specified in the
order, the Code Enforcement Officer shall cause the premises to be closed and
secured through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by
private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate
upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate
and may be collected by any other legal resource.
(108.2) (Prior Code, § 29-1-48)
   (C)   Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer has condemned a structure or
equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such notice and served
on the owner or the person or persons responsible for the structure or
equipment in accordance with §
150.021(C). If the notice pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on the
condemned equipment. The notice shall be in the form prescribed in §
150.021(B).
(Prior Code, § 29-1-49)
   (D)   (1)   Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply with
the notice provisions within the time given, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
post on the premises or on defective equipment, a placard bearing the word
“condemned” and a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the
premises, operating the equipment, or removing the placard.
(108.4)
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall remove the condemnation placard
whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and placarding
action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or removes a
condemnation placard without the approval of the Code Enforcement Officer shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this code.
(108.4.1)
      (3)   (a)   Only the Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to remove a
condemnation placard. The Code Enforcement Officer is to remove the placard
only when the defect or defects have been corrected as required by the code.
         (b)   Any other person who removes or defaces a placard is in
violation of this chapter and subject to its penalties.
(Prior Code, § 29-1-50)
   (E)   Any occupied structure condemned and placarded by the Code Enforcement
Officer shall be vacated as ordered by the Code Enforcement Officer. Any person
who shall occupy a placarded premises or shall operate placarded equipment, and
any owner or any person responsible for the premises who shall let anyone
occupy a placarded premises or operate placarded equipment shall be liable for
the penalties provided by this code.

life is endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when there is actual
or potential danger to the building, occupants, or those in the proximity of
any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes, or vapors or the presence
of toxic fumes, gases, or materials, or operation of defective or dangerous
equipment, the Code Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized and empowered to
order and require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith.
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall cause to be posted at each
entrance to such structure a notice reading as follows: “This Structure is
Unsafe and its Occupancy has been Prohibited by the Code Enforcement Officer.”
It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure except for the
purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs, removing the
hazardous condition, or of demolishing the same.

unsafe condition, the Code Enforcement Officer shall order the necessary work
to be done, including the boarding up of openings, to render such structure
temporarily safe, whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been
instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as the Code
Enforcement Officer deems necessary to meet such emergency.
(109.2) (Prior Code, § 29-1-61)
   (C)   When necessary for public safety, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
temporarily close structures and close, or order the authority having

   (F)   Any person ordered to take emergency measures shall comply with such
order forthwith. Any affected person shall thereafter, upon petition directed
to the appeals boards, be afforded a hearing as described in this chapter.

§ 150.024 DEMOLITION.
   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall order the owner of any premises
upon which is located any structure, which in the Code Enforcement Officer’s
judgment is so old, dilapidated, or has become so out of repair as to be
dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise unfit for human habitation or
occupancy, and such that it is unreasonable to repair the structure, to
demolish and remove such structure; or if such structure is capable of being
made safe by repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary or to demolish and
remove at the owner’s option; or where there has been a cessation of normal

(110.3) (Prior Code, § 29-1-69)
   (D)   When any structure has been ordered demolished and removed, the
governing body or other designated officer under said contract or arrangement
aforesaid shall have the right to sell the salvage and valuable materials at
the highest price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting
the expenses of such demolition and removal, shall be promptly remitted with a
report of such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and amounts
deducted, for the person who is entitled thereto, subject to any order of a
court. If such a surplus does not remain to be turned over, the report shall so
state.

   The degree of protection required by this code of ordinances is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and Is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-11)
§ 152.012 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Board of
Trustees to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance
adopted to achieve eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. Nor
does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-13)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to obtain a permit for development In the floodplain or
failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Village Attorney

The Village Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (B)   If such owner fails, after ten days’ notice, to correct the violation:
      (1)   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than $50, nor more than $500 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during

   (D)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

(Prior Code, § 34-4-1) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.021 SUBDIVISION VARIANCES.
   Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance from the requirements of this
chapter shall file a written application therefor with the Administrator at the
same time that he or she files his or her preliminary plat or at the time of
filing the application for approval of a final development plan under the PD
provisions of the Zoning Code. The application shall fully explain the grounds
for the variance request, and specify the section(s) of this chapter which, if
strictly applied, would cause great practical difficulties or hardship. The
Administrator shall prepare an advisory report on every variance application
and submit it, together with the completed application, to the Plan Commission.
(Prior Code, § 34-4-2) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.022 REVIEW OF PLAN COMMISSION.
   The Plan Commission shall review the variance application and the
Administrator’s comments, perform on-site review when appropriate, and submit
their advisory report to the Board of Trustees together with its recommendation
on preliminary plat approval (see §
153.041). The Plan Commission’s advisory report shall be responsive to all the
variances standards set forth in §
153.023.
(Prior Code, § 34-4-3)
§ 153.023 ACTION BY BOARD OF TRUSTEES; VARIANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   At the same meeting at which they take action on the application for
preliminary plat approval (see §

be attached to both the preliminary and final plats.
   (B)   The Board of Trustees shall not grant any subdivision variance unless,
based upon the information presented to them, they determine that:
      (1)   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this chapter (see §
153.001);
      (2)   Strict application of the subdivision requirements (see §
153.130) would result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the
applicant, not a mere inconvenience;
      (3)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship;
      (4)   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his or her own making;
      (5)   The peculiar circumstances creating the variance request are not
applicable to other tracts and, therefore, that a variance would be a more
appropriate remedy than a code amendment; and
      (6)   The variance, if granted, will not materially frustrate
implementation of the village’s Comprehensive Plan including the Official Map.

PLATS AND PLANS; PRELIMINARY PLATS
§ 153.040 GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Before preparing a proposed plat for an area, the owner, developer, or
their representatives should have a pre-application meeting with the Plan
Commission and/or the Village Planner to determine applicable ordinance
regulations and standards which must be complied with. After the preapplication
meeting(s), the subdivider should then prepare the preliminary plat.
   (B)   As defined in this chapter, the preliminary plat shall contain a
substantial amount of data, and will thus be incomplete and cannot be
considered as filed until all required data are submitted.
   (C)   The preliminary plat is received with filing fees by the Village
Clerk’s office, who, in turn, will forward the same to the Plan Commission for
their review. Following its review as well as comments from other appropriate
agencies when required, the Plan Commission forwards its recommendations to the
Board of Trustees, who then either approve, disapprove, or approve with
modifications the preliminary plat.
(Prior Code, § 34-3-1)
§ 153.041 FILING PROCEDURE; EXCEPTION.
   (A)   Except as specifically provided otherwise within this section, every
person who proposes to subdivide any land located within the subdivision
jurisdiction of the village shall file six copies of the preliminary plat of
said subdivision with the Village Clerk.
   (B)   He or she shall also file one copy of the preliminary plat and
supporting data with the appropriate Soil and Water Conservation District. The
district shall have not more than 30 days to submit any comments it might wish
to make to the Administrator.
   (C)   (1)   Within three business days after the preliminary plat has been
submitted for approval, the Administrator shall notify the president of the
school board that the plat has been submitted for approval and that it is
available for inspection.
      (2)   The notice shall also give the date, time, and place of the hearing
on approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat. The notice shall be served
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery. Failure
to notify the school board as required by this section does not invalidate the
plat.
   (D)   (1)   In the event the preliminary plat proposes access to a state
highway or non-village controlled street, or if any part of the platted land
will not be served by a public sewer system, then the applicant shall
simultaneously file with the State Department of Transportation, relevant local
highway authority, or health department, as appropriate, a copy of the
application for preliminary approval of a proposed plat.
      (2)   The department or authority receiving the application shall review
the application based solely upon safety or access control standards and
provide written approval or disapproval to the Plan Commission and the Board of
Trustees not later than 90 days from the date the application was received. The
90-day period may be changed by mutual agreement.
      (3)   If disapproved, the department or authority shall provide reasons
for the disapproval related to safety or access control standards and identify
improvements that will remove the disapproval. The Board of Trustees may
approve the plat once the improvements have been incorporated into the
application or in the event the department or authority fails to respond in
writing to the village within the 90-day period or other period established by
mutual agreement.
   (E)   Whenever a large tract is to be developed in stages and only a portion
of that tract is to be submitted for final plat approval, nonetheless, a master
development plan of the entire tract shall be submitted.
   (F)   All the preliminary plats shall be reviewed and acted upon in
accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8 and the provisions of the sections below.
   (G)   The provision of this section shall not apply to:
      (1)   Minor subdivisions as defined at §
153.007(B); or
      (2)   Land that is specifically exempted from the State Plats Act as now
or hereafter amended.

provision has been made for collection and diversion of such surface waters
into public areas, or drains which the subdivider has a right to use, and that
such surface waters will be planned for in accordance with generally accepted

building sites are at or above street grade.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-9)
§ 153.135 THROUGH TRAFFIC DISCOURAGED.
   Marginal access and local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use
by through traffic. The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern shall be
avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets
shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable street layout.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-10)
§ 153.136 LIMITED ACCESS TO ARTERIALS.
   Where a development abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Plan Commission may recommend to the Board of Trustees that access
to said arterial street be limited by one of the following means:
   (A)   By subdividing lots so they back onto the arterial street and front
onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in a reserve (access-restricting) strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots;
   (B)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from
and generally at right angles to the arterial street, with the rear lot lines
of the lots at the termini of such streets backing onto the arterial street; or
   (C)   A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip, but having access thereto at suitable points.

§ 153.138 DEAD-END STREETS.
   (A)   Temporary stub streets. Streets shall be so arranged to provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
and police protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where such
continuation comports with the village’s Official Map. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must dead-end temporarily, the right-of-way shall
be extended to the property line, and no strip that would prevent connections
with future streets shall be reserved. A temporary turnabout shall be provided
at the terminus of any temporary dead-end street.
   (B)   Permanent dead-end streets. For greater convenience to traffic and
more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be
limited to 500 feet in length, except as may be approved by the Board of
Trustees under the Planned Development (PD) procedures of the Zoning Code.
   (C)   Turnaround. The terminus of a permanent dead-end street shall not be
closer than 50 feet to the boundary of an adjacent tract. A cul-de-sac
turnaround, having a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and a minimum
pavement radius of 42 feet, shall be provided at the end of every permanent
dead-end street.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-12) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.139 INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Only two streets. Not more than two streets intersect at any one
point.
   (B)   Right angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles; in no case shall two streets intersect at an angle
of less than 75 degrees. An oblique street shall be curved approaching an
intersection and shall be approximately at right angles with said intersection
for at least 40 feet therefrom.
   (C)   Proper alignment.
      (1)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, whenever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street.
      (2)   treet jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not
be permitted, except where the intersected street has divided lanes without
median breaks at either intersection. Intersections involving collector or
arterial streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
   (D)   Curb radii. To permit safe vehicular movements at corners, the minimum
right-of-way radius at the intersection of two streets shall be 20 feet, and
the minimum radius at the back of the curb shall be 30 feet.
   (E)   Flat grade. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a 3% slope for a
distance of 50 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street shall be provided at the approach to an intersection.
   (F)   Maximum cross-slope. The cross-slopes on all streets, including
intersections, shall not exceed 3%.
   (G)   Adequate sight-lines. Where any street intersection will involve earth
banks or existing vegetation on the triangular area shown in Chapter 154,
Appendix B, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including
trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-13) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.140 REVERSE CURVES.
   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves
on local collector and collector streets.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-14) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.141 IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING STREETS.
    Whenever any development abuts an existing street that is narrower than the
standards indicated in the Table of Street Design Specifications in §
153.137, the subdivider shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way on the side
abutting the development to permit compliance with those standards. The
developer shall improve said street to the standards imposed at §§
153.140 and
153.141 and pay one-half the cost of said improvements, exceptions may
otherwise be arranged for and approved by the Board of Trustees under the
Planned Development (PD) provisions of the Zoning Code.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-15) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.142 IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Developer’s expense.
      (1)   All streets and alleys shall be improved solely at the expense of
the developer in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. Typical
roadway and pavement sections are shown in Appendix A of this chapter.
      (2)   Requirements for pavement materials, equipment, and methods of
construction for bituminous concrete and other types of flexible pavement and
portland cement concrete (rigid) pavements are contained in the table in
division (B)(2)(c) below. Existing streets that adjoin the development on one
side only will be improved to meet the current street standards, and this cost
will be shared equally between the village and the developer. Existing streets
that join the development on both sides shall be improved at the developer’s
expense.
      (4)   The extent of the improvement of existing streets will be
determined by the village and the developer during improvement plan approval
process. All streets shall meet IDOT’s Roads and Bridges Standard
Specifications.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-20)
   (B)   Pavement structure. All streets and alleys shall be paved across the
entire surface width specified in § 153.133(A). The structural composition of
the pavement shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in the table
in division (B)(2)(c) below. Design requirements for both rigid and flexible
pavements are set forth hereinafter.
      (1)   Except as otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees under the
planned development (PD) provisions of the Zoning Code, flexible pavements are
to be constructed as multi-layered structures combining hot-mix bituminous
concrete/bituminous base/crushed stone base/subbase.
         (a)   Each layer of material is to be constructed in lifts not to
exceed the maximum lift thickness (compacted) specified under Flexible Pavement
Alternative 1 and 2 in division (B)(2)(c) below.
         (b)   The minimum width of any single pass for any lift/layer of
bituminous mixture shall be ten feet. There are alternate designs for either
deep-strength asphalt or bituminous concrete on a crushed stone base/subbase.
      (2)   Rigid pavements are specified as either reinforced or unreinforced
portland cement concrete to be constructed either on the earth subgrade or on a
crushed stone subbase or underlayment. Alternate designs are shown for two of
the seven street classifications. The underlayment is to be one-fourth inch
thick fabric, such as “bidim” or “petromat,” or equal.
         (a)   Contraction joints are to be provided at the spacings shown in
division (B)(2)(b) below for each of the various alternates. These transverse
joints are to be sawed joints that are one-eighth inch to one-fourth inch wide
with a depth equal to one-fourth of the pavement thickness. Sawed construction
joints are to be sawed within 24 hours of placement on the concrete. All
contraction joints are to be dowelled with the exception of the alleys and land
access residential streets. Dowel sizes and spacing shall comply with the
following requirements:
 
Pavement Thickness  Minimum Dowel Minimum Dowel Length Minimum Dowel Spacing
(inches)            Diameter      (inches)             (inches)
                    (inches)

8                   1             15                   12
 
      (b)   The dowel units are to be smooth, plain, round bars placed at mid-
height of the pavement with an expansion cap on one end. The bars, or
assemblies, shall be placed so that the bars are parallel to the centerline and
to the pavement surface and shall be treated to prevent bonding of the
concrete.
      (c)   Longitudinal joints shall be constructed no closer than eight feet
and no farther apart than 15 feet. The longitudinal joints may be either
construction joints or sawed joints. In either case, there shall be transverse
No. 4 reformed tie bars, 30 inches long, spaced at 30-inch centers along all
longitudinal joints. This includes the joint between the pavement and curb/
gutter if the curb/gutter is not constructed integral with the pavement. As an
option to tie bars, either a half-round or trapezoidal preformed keyway meeting
the following dimensions may be used on longitudinal joints excluding the
gutter joint:

   (B)   In areas where the public sanitary sewerage system is not reasonably
accessible but where plans for the installation of said system have been
approved by the State Environmental Protection Agency, sanitary sewers shall be
provided in accordance with such plans and temporarily capped. To serve the
subdivision until the time when connection to the public system becomes
practicable, an approved private central sewage disposal system shall be
installed, or individual sewage disposal systems may be used.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-46)
   (C)   In the event it is not possible, or feasible, for the subdivider to
extend the public sewer system into the proposed subdivision, for whatever
reason, the subdivider has the right to petition the village to install an
alternative method of sewage disposal. Any such petition shall be considered on
an individual basis with each case standing on its own merit. No subdivision
shall be approved without the village’s approval of the method of sewage
disposal.
      (1)   Private central sewage systems. Upon specific approval of the Board
of Trustees, the subdivider may install a private central sewage system. The
village shall reserve the right to review and approve/reject the detailed plans
for such a system. Approval of the plans by the village shall in no way be
construed as acceptance of the design or operation or maintenance
responsibility for said installation. Such installation shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State
Environmental Protection Agency, and the State Department of Public Health. The
subdivider shall assume perpetual operational and maintenance responsibilities
for such installation unless arrangements to the contrary are provided for in a
formal written agreement between homeowners and the subdivider.
      (2)   Individual disposal systems. Upon written approval of the Board of
Trustees, the subdivider may install individual sewage disposal systems
providing the lot size is in excess of 20,000 square feet. If such
installations are permitted, they shall be designed and installed in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the requirements and regulations of the
Private Sewage Disposal Licensing Act, being 225 ILCS 225/1, and Code of the
State Department of Public Health, being 77 Ill. Admin. Code.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-47)
§ 153.151 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   (1)   Purpose. It is the policy of the village to protect and promote
the public health, safety and general welfare. The criteria for storm water
detention will reduce the possibility of damage to public and private property,
will reduce the erosion on land and creek channels, will assist in the
attainment and maintenance of water quality standards, and will preserve and
enhance the environmental quality of the watercourses in the village. This
criteria provides uniform procedures for designing and checking the design of
storm drainage detention systems.
      (2)   Intent.
         (a)   The Plan Commission shall not recommend the approval of any plat
unless, after consultation with the Village Engineer, it determines that the
proposed provisions for storm water drainage are adequate.
         (b)   Drainage improvements in the subdivision shall be coordinated
with existing and planned drainage improvements elsewhere so as to form an
integrated municipal system. The storm water drainage system shall be separate
and independent of the sanitary sewer system.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-49)
   (B)   (1)   Development. Any activity, including subdivisions, that alters
the surface of the land to create additional impervious surfaces, including,
but not limited to, pavement, buildings, and structures, except:
         (a)   Additions to, improvements, and repair of existing single-family
and duplex dwellings;
         (b)   Construction of any buildings, structures, and/or appurtenant
service roads, drives, and walks on a site having previously provided storm
water control as part of a larger unit of development with the original
development plan;
         (c)   Remodeling, repair, replacement, and improvements to any
existing structure or facility and appurtenances that does not increase the
impervious area on the site in excess of 10% or add one care of impervious
area; and
         (d)   Construction of any one new single-family or duplex unit,
irrespective of the site area on which the same may be situated.
      (2)   Emergency spillway. A device or devices used to discharge water
under conditions of inflow that exceed the design inflow. The emergency
spillway functions primarily to prevent damage to the detention facility that
would permit the sudden release of impounded water. It shall be designed to
handle the runoff from a 100-year storm.
      (3)   Freeboard. The difference in elevation between the top of a
structure such as a dam or open channel and the maximum design water surface
elevation or high water mark and is an allowance against overtopping by waves
or other transient disturbances.
      (4)   Principal spillway. A device such as an inlet, pipe, weir, and the
like, to discharge water during operation of the facility under the conditions
of a 25-year or less return frequency of the existing conditions, before the
proposed development.
      (5)   Private detention facility. Any detention facility located on and
controlling discharge from a site wholly owned and controlled by one owner and
not platted for future subdivision of ownership. Also, all facilities
incorporating detention storage of storm water in or on any of the following:
         (a)   Roofs of buildings or structures also used for other purposes;
         (b)   Paved or surfaced areas also used for other purposes; or
         (c)   Enclosed underground pipes or structures on private property
when the surface is used for other purposes.
      (6)   Public detention facility. Any detention facility controlling
discharge from a tributary area owned by more than one owner and/or platted for
future subdivision of ownership, except as defined as a private detention
facility herein.
      (7)   Rational method. An empirical formula for calculating peak rates of
runoff resulting from rainfall.
      (8)   State Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Manual. This manual published in March of 1982
(IPSUSESCM).
      (9)   Tributary area. All land draining to the point of consideration,
regardless of ownership.

(Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
GUIDELINES
§ 153.165 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall apply to all development within the limits of the
village. Residential developments having a total area of less than five acres,
and commercial or industrial developments having a total area of less than two
acres, may be given a waiver by the village in accordance with §
153.023, subject to the following conditions.
   (A)   The village retains the right to require detention storage in all
cases in which the proposed development will generate excess runoff that
adversely affects the carrying capacity of the receiving watercourse.
   (B)   Developments less than two acres with less than 30% of the area paved
and developments generating less than one cubic foot per second (CFS) per acre
increased runoff shall not be required to provide detention storage, unless
conditions of division (A) above are applicable.
   (C)   This chapter shall apply for all newly platted areas and new
developments proposed after the date of passage of this chapter. All
developments that have an approved preliminary plan by the Plan and Zoning
Commission at the time of the approval of this chapter will not have to conform
to this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-52)
§ 153.166 AFFIDAVIT OF DISCLOSURE OF PROPERTY INTEREST.
   The effective acreage for a site is not limited to a fractional part of the
total. If a project is developed in phases or small plats, the total acreage of
the project site must be considered. At the time the owner of any development
submits a preliminary plat or preliminary plan, he or she shall also identify
to the village all contiguous property or property in the watershed that he or
she has interest in.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-53)
§ 153.167 METHOD OF EVALUATION.
   (A)   For detention basin facilities, the storage capacity and discharge
rate shall be based upon the calculated volume and peak flow of the storm water
runoff, respectively. The calculations for sites having an area of 100 acres or
less shall be made using either the State Manual for Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control method or the rational method. If the site is larger than
100 acres, then the Village Engineer shall use the State Manual for Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control method, or, if another method is desired to
be used, the Village Engineer shall submit a proposed method of evaluation for
the calculations for review and approval.
   (B)   The permitted discharge rate of storm water runoff shall be determined
by calculating the rate of runoff for the site’s pre- and post-development
conditions. The Village Engineer shall determine the most critical storm
looking at three different time periods:
      (1)   The time of concentration;
      (2)   A one-hour storm; and
      (3)   A 24-hour storm.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-54) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.168 DETENTION OF DIFFERENTIAL RUNOFF.
   All new developments shall provide a storm water system that ensures that
the rate of flow of storm water runoff discharged from the site after
development does not exceed the rate of flow of storm water runoff discharged
from the site before development of a 25-year storm, unless given a waiver by
the village in accordance with §
153.023. Data shall be submitted for the 15-year, 25-year, and 100-year
frequency storm.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-55)
§ 153.169 FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM AREAS.
   (A)   Flows from upstream areas outside the site should be based upon the
assumption that those areas are fully developed under forecast land use
patterns.
   (B)   The required storage volume will be based upon the site only, with
flows from upstream areas being bypassed or discharged via overflow spillways
or other devices for the 100-year storm.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-56)
§ 153.170 FACILITIES IN FLOODPLAINS.
   (A)   If detention storage is provided within a floodplain, only the net
increase in storage volume above that which naturally existed on the floodplain
shall be credited to the development.
   (B)   No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the base
flood at that location unless compensatory storage is also provided. Where
encroachments in the existing floodplain fill the valley storage areas, an
equal amount of detention volume shall be provided.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-57)
§ 153.171 LAND CREDIT FOR DETENTION AREAS.
   The number of units/lots shall be based on the total area of the tract to be
developed. All areas to be used as detention facilities shall be included in
this total area.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-58)
DESIGN CRITERIA
§ 153.185 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS; REFERENCES.
   (A)   (1)   The design shall be accomplished under the direction of a
registered professional engineer.
      (2)   The design shall also be based on land use in the tributary area as
zoned, actually developed, or indicated by an adopted future land use plan,
whichever basis produces the greatest runoff.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-60)
   (B)   Other agencies have criteria and regulations pertaining to drainage
systems which may complement this criteria. When conflicts are encountered the
most rigorous criteria shall govern.
      (1)   Federal Insurance Agency; floodplain regulations and implementing
ordinances adopted by municipalities. Drainage systems designed within the
limits of the designated 100-year floodplain on the principal stream shall be
designed to convey the flood as defined by applicable published floodplain
information studies. For areas located in FIA Zone A outside the detailed study
area, the developer shall prepare studies and calculations establishing the
floodplain, elevation, and width. These calculations shall be submitted to the
reviewing agency for approval.
      (2)   State Department of Water Resources. Rules and regulations of dams
and reservoirs shall apply to those structures classified as dams thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-61)
§ 153.186 STORM WATER RUNOFF.
   The design criteria used in determining the amount of runoff shall be the
same as set out in §
153.151.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-62)
§ 153.187 HYDRAULIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR DETENTION STORAGE.
   Hydraulic considerations for detention storage shall be designed to meet the
following requirements.
   (A)   Principal spillways shall be designed to meet the following.
      (1)   The principal spillway shall be designed to function without
requiring attendance or operation of any kind or requiring use of equipment or
tools.
      (2)   All discharge from the detention facility when inflow is equal to
or less than the 100-year inflow shall be via the principal spillways.
      (3)   The design shall allow for discharge of at least 80% of the dry
detention storage volume within 24 hours after the peak or center of mass of
the inflow has entered the detention basin. On basins less than 100 acres, this
shall not apply.
      (4)   The design discharge rate via the spillway shall continuously
increase with increasing head and shall have hydraulic characteristics similar
to weirs, orifices, or pipes.
   (B)   The emergency spillway shall be provided to pass a 100-year storm
without damaging any property and, where applicable, designed to the State
Department of Water Resources’s dam safety requirements.
   (C)   Outlet works shall have an outlet works consisting of valves, gates,
pipes, and other devices as necessary to completely drain the facility in 72
hours or less when required for maintenance or inspection on normally wet
basins.
   (D)   Sediment storage shall be designed to provide for five years of
sediment accumulation calculated by using Chapter 154, Appendix B. All other
detention facilities shall provide storage for two years of sediment
accumulation by using Chapter 154, Appendix B, except for those using roofs of
buildings, paved parking areas or other facilities designed to preclude the
deposition or accumulation of sediment. Sediment storage volume shall be in
addition to the volume required for temporary storage of storm water to
properly size the detention facility on normally wet basins.
   (E)   For erosion control, principal spillways and outlet works shall be
designed to prevent erosion and if necessary equipped with energy dissipating
devices to slow the water to normal velocity as called out in the IPSUSESC
Manual. Special measures shall be taken by the developer to not permit sediment
from filling the proposed detention basin during all construction of the
proposed development.
   (F)   For the public detention facilities, the owner shall dedicate the
detention facility and easements as set forth upon completion of the one-year
warranty period and approval by the Village Engineer, except:
      (1)   When multi-purpose wet facilities are planned or are suitable for
use for private aquatic recreation or for aesthetic enhancement of the owner’s
property; or
      (2)   When multi-purpose dry facilities incorporate surface recreational
improvements.
   (G)   Private detention facilities shall be designed requiring the same
criteria as the public detention facilities.
      (1)   An adequate easement shall be dedicated to the trustees of the
subdivision, homeowner’s association or owner of the property for the purpose
of access and maintenance of the storm water detention facility. The same shall
apply for access and maintenance of all dam and outfall structures.
      (2)   A plan for perpetual maintenance and designating responsibility for
the maintenance shall be provided for its continuing performance to the
standards established by this division (G).
(Prior Code, § 34-5-63) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.188 PLAN REQUIREMENTS.

   (A)   Elevation-area-capacity curves for the storage facility including
notation of the storage volumes allocated to runoff, and permanent residual
water storage for other uses (wet basins only);
   (B)   Inflow hydrographs (detention volumes for rational method) for the 15-
year, 25-year, and 100-year recurrence interval design storms;
   (C)   Stage-discharge rating curves for each spillway and for combined
spillway discharges; and
   (D)   Routing curves for the 15-year and all greater criteria recurrence
interval design storms with time plotted as the abscissa and the following
plotted as ordinates (this item is not required for the rational method):
      (1)   Cumulative inflow volume;
      (2)   Cumulative discharge; and
      (3)   Stage elevation.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-65)
§ 153.189 CONSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES.
   A developer shall build, as part of his or her development, a detention
basin as required by this chapter, unless the following divisions apply.
   (A)   Developers of adjacent tracts may combine to build one detention site
large enough to meet the requirements of all the tracts of land with approval
of the village. The basin shall be located in the same drainage basin.
   (B)   On-site detention will be required whenever increased runoff from the
proposed development creates a hazard downstream as determined by the Village
Engineer.
   (C)   Where existing strip mine ponds, either in their existing state or as
modified in shape and size, will satisfy the design intent of this chapter and
only as approved by the Board of Trustees upon recommendation of the Village
Engineer.
   (D)   The outlet structure requirements in §
153.187 will still have to be met.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-66) (Ord. 06-07, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 153.190 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, AND ACCEPTANCE.
   (A)   Inspection. The developer shall inspect or cause to be inspected all
storm water detention systems constructed within the village. Through such
inspection reports the Village Engineer shall ensure that the facilities under
construction are being constructed in accordance with the approved plans for
such development.
   (B)   Maintenance.
      (1)   Each owner of the property being developed has the responsibility
and duty to properly operate and maintain any storm water management system
which has not been accepted for maintenance by the village. The responsibility
of maintenance of the system and subdivision projects shall remain with the
developer until such time as the storm water management system escrow for such
development has been released at the end of the one year warranty period.
      (2)   Upon release of escrow, the maintenance responsibility shall be
vested in the trustees of the subdivision by virtue of a trust indenture.
Indenture of trusts shall clearly indicate resident responsibility for
maintenance. All such privately owned maintained systems shall be subject to
periodic inspections by the Village Engineer or his or her representative.
      (3)   After an inspection by the Village Engineer, he or she determines
whether or not the conditions of the privately owned storm water detention
system are safe and correct. Any cost incurred by the village, as a result of
the Village Engineer’s actions, shall be attest against the owner(s) of the
system.
   (C)   Acceptance. Upon acceptance by the Board of Trustees, the storm water
detention system may be dedicated to the village for perpetual maintenance. Any
such system shall include adequate perpetual access and sufficient area for
maintenance by the village personnel and vehicles.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-67)
§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who violates this chapter shall be, upon conviction,
subject to a fine up to $750 for each offense.
(Prior Code, § 34-5-71)
   (B)   (1)   Any person who is convicted of a violation of this chapter shall
be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than $50, nor
more than $750, plus costs. Each day that a violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense.
      (2)   Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the village from
taking any other lawful action that may be necessary to secure compliance with
this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 34-4-8)
   (C)   Failure of the subdivider to discharge his or her operational/

general planning practice, consistent with good site planning, can be
constructed and operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted
uses in the district, would be visually compatible with the uses in the
surrounding area and is deemed desirable to promote the general welfare of the
village. The Plan Commission must also consider architectural, landscape and
other relationships which may exist between the proposed PD development and the
character of the surrounding neighborhood and must prescribe or require such
physical treatment or other limitations as will, in its option, enhance the
neighborhood character.
   (D)   If no report is transmitted by the Plan Commission within 60 days from
the date that the application is first reviewed by the Plan Commission at a
regular meeting, the President and Board of Trustees may take action on such
proposed plan even though the Plan Commission has not submitted its report. If
the Plan Commission fails to hold the public hearing required by Section 40-3-
23(b), the President and Board of Trustees may assume that responsibility and
hold such a hearing after providing the requisite notice.
   (E)   (1)   Upon receipt of the Plan Commission’s report, the President and
Board of Trustees shall either approve the application by adopting an ordinance
amending the Official Zoning Map and authorizing the PD zoning designation in
accordance with the preliminary development plan, or deny the application.
      (2)   If the application is approved, the matter shall be returned to the
Plan Commission for consideration of a final development plan.
   (F)   (1)   Minor, technical, and mechanical changes to the preliminary
development plan may be approved by the Zoning Administrator without review by

§ 154.205 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Purpose and findings.
      (1)   It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the citizens of the village, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the village. The provisions of this section have
neither the purpose, nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent, nor
effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
      (2)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the Village Board of Trustees, and on findings related in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., TDBA Kandyland, 529 U.S. 277 (2000), City
of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425, 122 S. Ct. 1728 (2002),
Northend Cinema, Inc, v. City of Seattle, 90 Wash.2d 709 (1978), and studies in
“Report to the American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impact of
Sex Oriented Business,” Environmental Research Group, March 31, 1996, “Report
of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Business,” Hubert H. Humphrey, III, Attorney General for the State of
Minnesota, June 6, 1989, and “Appendix D: Summaries of Secondary Effects
Reports,” Preface to the second edition, Community Defense Counsel, the Board
of Trustees finds:
         (a)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to
make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises;
         (b)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in
this section as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments;
         (c)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows;
         (d)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions;
         (e)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and
other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within
the premises of such sexually oriented businesses;
         (f)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infections;
         (g)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test.
         (h)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his or her report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection
may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn;
         (i)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts;
         (j)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities;
         (k)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult-oriented
films;
         (l)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
         (m)   Reasonable zoning and licensing procedures are appropriate
mechanisms to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such procedures
will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented
business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of
its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein;
         (n)   The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the
village will be promoted by the enactment of this section;
         (o)   The findings noted in divisions (A)(2)(a) through (A)(2)(n)
above raise substantial governmental concerns; and
         (p)   The findings and opinions of the cases and studies as related in
the opening of paragraph (B) of this section are the findings of the Board of
Trustees as if set forth verbatim herein.
   (B)   Applicability. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter,
adult entertainment businesses shall be allowed only pursuant to a special use
permit and only in I-1 (Industrial Districts) zoned districts in the village.

of nonconforming structures set forth in §§
154.290 through
154.295; provided as follows:
   (A)   Merely changing the message displayed on a nonconforming sign shall
not be construed as a prohibited alteration; and

subsequently repaired or rebuilt, parking/loading facilities equivalent to any
maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored, but
additional parking/loading spaces need not be provided.

addition of dwelling units, increased floor area, greater seating capacity, and
the like, additional off-street parking and loading spaces commensurate with
such intensification shall be provided.
   (D)   Whenever the existing use of a structure is changed to a different
use, off-street parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required
herein for such new use.
(Prior Code, § 40-7-2)
§ 154.272 PARKING LOT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All off-street parking lots shall conform to the standards of this section.
   (A)   Standards applicable to all parking areas.
      (1)   Spaces. Every off-street parking space shall be at least ten feet
wide and 20 feet long, and shall have at least seven feet of vertical
clearance. Every space shall be situated so that no part of any parked vehicle
overhangs the public right-of-way.
      (2)   Access ways. Parking lots shall be designed so that ingress to or
egress from a parking space is from an aisle or driveway, not directly from the
public right-of-way.
         (a)   No access way to any parking lot shall be located within 30 feet
of any corner formed by the intersection of the rights-of-way of two or more
streets. At intersections where traffic control devices are installed, the
Administrator may increase this requirement as necessary to prevent hazards.
         (b)   Parking lot access ways (as well as residential driveways) and
public streets shall be aligned to form, as closely as feasible, right angles.
         (c)   The access way to every parking lot located in any residential
district or in the Agriculture District shall be at least ten feet wide; but if
the parking area is longer than 100 feet, access shall be provided either by
one two-way drive at least 20 feet wide or by two one-way drives, each at least
ten feet wide.
      (3)   Lighting. Any light(s) used to illuminate any parking lot shall be
arranged or shielded so as to confine direct light rays within the lot lines of
the parking lot to the greatest extent possible, and in no case shall the light
(s) shine on or into nearby residences.
   (B)   Standards applicable to all parking areas except those accessory to
single- or two-family dwellings.
      (1)   Spaces. Markings shall be laid and restored as often as necessary
to clearly delineate each parking space.
      (2)   Interior aisles. Aisles within parking lots shall be sufficiently
wide to permit safe and efficient vehicular movement in the aisles, and into
and out of parking spaces. Aisles designed for two-way traffic shall be at
least 22 feet wide. One-way aisles designed for 60-degree parking shall be at
least 18 feet wide.
      (3)   Access ways. The access way to every parking lot located in any

compacted stone base at least seven inches thick, surfaced with at least two
inches of asphaltic concrete, or approved comparable material. Parking lots
used exclusively for employees are hereby exempt from these requirements, but
shall be constructed of an approved dustless surface (“oil and chip” is not
comparable material).
      (5)   Landscaping. In order to reduce heat and glare, to minimize blowing
of dust and trash, and to reduce the oppressive visual effects of large open
parking areas, landscaping shall be provided and maintained within every
parking lot that contains 20 or more parking spaces. Parking lots used
exclusively for employees are hereby exempt from these requirements, but shall
be constructed of an approved, dustless surface.
         (a)   A landscaping plan (either a separate document or an element of
a more inclusive development plan) shall accompany every application for a
certificate of zoning compliance to develop any parking lot that will contain
20 or more parking spaces.
         (b)   The landscaping plan shall include the following information:
            1.   Proposed type, amount, size, and spacing of plantings,
including trees, shrubbery, and ground cover;
            2.   Proposed size, construction materials, and drainage of
landscaped islands; and
            3.   A sketch indicating proposed spatial relationships of
landscaped areas, parking spaces, automobile circulation, and pedestrian
movement.

   All off-street parking shall be located in conformity with the following
requirements.
   (A)   Dwellings.
      (1)   Parking spaces accessory to any dwelling shall be located on the
same lot as the dwelling. Such parking spaces shall not be located in any
required front yard or required side yard adjacent to a street, except in the
driveway, but may be located in the side or rear yards.
      (2)   Each parking space accessory to a multi-family dwelling shall be
unobstructed so that no vehicle need be moved in order to allow another vehicle
to enter/exit the parking area; provided that this requirement shall not be
applicable to two-family dwellings.
   (B)   For business/industrial uses.
      (1)   Every off-street parking space accessory to any business or
industrial use shall be located within 500 feet of the use served; provided
that no portion of any parking lot for non-residential uses shall extend into
any residential district or into the Agriculture District, except by written
permission of the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   In any business district or in the Industrial District, off-street
parking facilities for different buildings or uses may be provided
collectively, but only if the total number of spaces so located together is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements for each use, and if all other
pertinent regulations are observed.
(Prior Code, § 40-7-4)
§ 154.274 DESIGN AND LOCATION OF OFF-STREET LOADING FACILITIES.
   All off-street loading facilities shall conform to the minimum standards
indicated below.
   (A)   Size of space. Every off-street loading space shall be at least 12
feet wide and 45 feet long exclusive of aisle and maneuver space, and shall
have vertical clearance of at least 14 feet. In no case shall a vehicle being
loaded or unloaded overhang into the public right-of-way.
   (B)   Access way. Every off-street loading space shall have a safe means of
vehicular access to a street or alley. Such access way shall be at least 12
feet wide.
   (C)   Surfacing. Every off-street loading area shall be improved with a
compacted stone base at least seven inches thick, surfaced with at least two
inches of asphaltic concrete or approved comparable material (no “oil and
chip”).
   (D)   Buffer strips. No loading space or area for vehicles over two-ton
cargo capacity shall be developed closer than 50 feet to the lot line of any
lot located in any residential district or in the Agricultural District unless
such space/area is completely enclosed by walls, a solid fence, or closely
planted shrubbery at least ten feet in height and of sufficient density to
block the view from residential property.
   (E)   Location. Every off-street loading space shall be located on the same
parcel of land as the use served, and not closer than 50 feet to the
intersection of the rights-of-way of two or more streets, and not on any
required front yard.
(Prior Code, § 40-7-5)
§ 154.275 COMPUTATION OF REQUIRED PARKING/LOADING SPACES.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this chapter, the
Zoning Administrator shall apply the following rules.
   (A)   In computing parking space requirements based on the number of
employees, the maximum number of employees on the premises at any period of the
day shall be used. EMPLOYEE PARKING means one parking space shall be required
per one and one-half employees, unless otherwise stated.
   (B)   In computing parking or loading space requirements on the basis of
building floor area, the gross floor area shall be used.
   (C)   Whenever it is necessary to translate gross parking lot area into
number of parking spaces, 350 square feet of gross area shall be deemed one
parking space.
   (D)   If computation of the number of parking or loading spaces required by
this chapter results in a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or more
shall be counted as one space.
   (E)   No space or portion thereof needed to satisfy the minimum applicable
requirement for number of off-street parking or loading spaces shall be counted
as part of the off-street parking or loading spaces required for another
structure or use.
(Prior Code, § 40-7-6)
§ 154.276 NUMBERING OF PARKING AND LOADING SPACED REQUIRED.
   Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as indicated in
tabular form below. For any use that is not listed in the table, the same
amount of parking and loading space shall be provided as is required for the
most similar listed use. The Zoning Administrator shall make the determination
of similarity.

(Prior Code, § 40-7-7)
NONCONFORMITIES
§ 154.290 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The requirements imposed by this chapter are designed to guide the use
of land by encouraging the development of structures and uses that are
compatible with the predominant character of each of the various districts.
   (B)   Lots, structures, and uses of land or structures that do not conform
to the requirements of the district in which they are located tend to impede
appropriate development. For example, nonconformities are frequently
responsible for heavy traffic on residential streets, the overtaxing of parking
facilities, the creation of nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values.
   (C)   The regulations of this subchapter are intended to alleviate such
existing/potential problems by encouraging the gradual elimination of
nonconformities.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-1)
§ 154.291 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   If the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance for any vacant lot
that does not conform to one or more of the lot size (area dimensions)
requirements of the district in which it is located, that lot may, nonetheless,
be developed for any use permitted in that district if such vacant lot:
      (1)   Was recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds prior to
the effective date of this chapter (or pertinent amendment thereto); and
      (2)   Has continuously remained in separate ownership from abutting
tracts of land throughout the entire period during which the creation of such
lot was prohibited by the applicable zoning code or other ordinances; and
      (3)   Is at least 50 feet wide.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-2)
   (B)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage were of record and in common ownership on the effective
date of this chapter, and if one or more of those lots does not meet the
minimum lot width, depth, or area requirements of the district in which it is
located, the land involved shall be considered an undivided parcel. No portion
of any such parcel shall be developed except in compliance with this chapter,
nor shall any such parcel be divided so as to create a lot that does not meet
the requirements of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-2.1)
§ 154.292 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Any otherwise lawful structure which exists on the effective date of this
chapter, but which could not be erected under the terms of this chapter because
of requirements/restrictions concerning lot size, height, setbacks, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   Maintenance. A nonconforming structure may be maintained by ordinary
repairs.
   (B)   Enlargement, alterations. A nonconforming structure shall not be
enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.
   (C)   Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless, after
relocation, it will conform to all the regulations of the district in which it
will be situated.
   (D)   Reconstruction.
      (1)   No structure which is destroyed or damaged by any means shall be
reconstructed if the Zoning Administrator determines that the cost of such
reconstruction exceeds 50% of the structure’s market value at the time of loss,
unless after reconstruction the structure will conform to all applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event the Zoning
Administrator determines the estimated cost of reconstruction is less than 50%
of the structure’s market value at the time of the loss, repairs or
reconstruction shall be permitted; provided such work starts within six months
from the date the damage occurred and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may require that the reconstruction cost
estimate be made by a bona fide construction contractor, and that the
structure’s market value at the time of loss be determined by a licensed real
estate appraiser. The owner of the damaged structure shall be responsible for
obtaining these estimates for the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   As an alternative, the market value may be determined by the Zoning
Administrator by using the “state equalized assessed value” multiplied by the
number three.
      (4)   The provisions of this division (D) shall not apply to single-
family dwellings.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-3)
§ 154.293 NONCONFORMING USES OCCUPYING A STRUCTURE.
   If any lawful use occupying a structure exists on the effective date of this
chapter, but would not be allowed under the terms of this chapter, such use may
lawfully continue, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   Maintenance. Any structure housing a nonconforming use may be
maintained through ordinary repairs.
   (B)   Enlargement, alteration, reconstruction, and relocation. No structure
housing a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, structurally altered,
reconstructed, or relocated, unless the use of the structure is changed to a
permitted use.
   (C)   Extension of use. No conforming use may be extended to any part(s) of
the structure not intended or designed for such use, nor shall the
nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such structure.
   (D)   Change of use. A nonconforming use occupying a structure may be
changed to a similar use, to a more restrictive use, or to a conforming use.
Such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
   (E)   Discontinuance of use. When a nonconforming use of a structure or of a
structure and premises in combination is discontinued for 12 consecutive months
or for 18 months during any three-year period, the nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be resumed. Any discontinuance caused by government action and
without any contributing fault by the nonconforming user shall not be counted
in calculating the length of discontinuance.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-4)
§ 154.294 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Any lawful use of land existing on the effective date of this chapter that
would not be permitted under the terms of this chapter may lawfully continue,
subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   Intensification or extension of use. A nonconforming use of land shall
not be intensified or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied by such use on the effective date of this chapter.
   (B)   Relocation. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or
in part, unless such use, upon relocation, will conform to all pertinent
regulations of the district in which it is proposed to be located.
   (C)   Change of use. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been
changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use shall not
thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use. If no structural alterations
are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification.
   (D)   Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a
period of 12 consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period,
it shall not thereafter be resumed, and any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the applicable district regulations. Any discontinuance caused by
government action and without any contributing fault by the owner or operator
shall not be counted in calculating the length of discontinuance.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-5)
§ 154.295 NONCONFORMING UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY.
   The regulations of this subchapter shall not apply to any change in an
existing structure or to any change in the use of a structure or of land for
which a permit was issued prior to the effective date of this chapter or any
pertinent amendment thereto; provided that the work authorized by such permit
is completed within a reasonable time.
(Prior Code, § 40-8-6)

Editor’s note:
   The Zoning Board of Appeals is delegated the task of hearing appeals from
the decisions of the Zoning Administrator or other official charged with
enforcement of an ordinance passed pursuant to the Zoning Enabling Act, being
65 ILCS 5/Art. 11, Div. 4. This may, for example, entail determining whether
there has been a discontinuance of a nonconforming use. It is important for the
applicant to note the appeal process because of the requirement of exhaustion
of administrative remedies before suit is filed as well as the more obvious
reason of using a less expensive administrative process for correcting a
mistake or error which may have been made by the Zoning Administrator.

    Related provisions, see 65 ILCS 5/11-13-3(d)

result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant.

variance unless they determine, based upon the evidence presented to them,
that:
      (1)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if the
district regulations are strictly applied;

the area where the premises in question are located, nor materially frustrate
implementation of the village’s Comprehensive Plan.

MOVING BUILDINGS
§ 155.001 PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; FEE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to move or cause to be moved any

permit therefor from the Village Clerk. Such permit shall be known as a “House
Moving Permit.”
(Prior Code, § 33-9-1)
   (B)   Any person desiring such a permit shall file with the Village Clerk an
application therefor in writing on a form to be furnished by the Street
Superintendent for that purpose. Such application shall specify the following:
      (1)   The character and size of the building to be moved;
      (2)   The reason for such moving;
      (3)   The use, purpose, and occupancy for which said building or
structure is to be used;
      (4)   The location from which and to which said building is to be moved;
      (5)   A plot plan showing the proposed location of the building upon the
property to which said building is to be moved; provided said location is in
the village;
      (6)   The streets on, over, or through which it is desired to move said
building; and
      (7)   Whether the building conforms to the Zoning Code or other
applicable regulations in the location to which it is to be moved.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-2)
   (C)   Upon the filing of the application, the Street Superintendent shall
cause the Zoning Administrator, or other authorized representative of the
village, to investigate the building and report to him or her the results of
such investigation, together with recommended action thereon.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-3)
   (D)   (1)   No permit shall be issued to move any building or structure
which, in the opinion of the Street Superintendent:
         (a)   Is so constructed or in such condition as to be dangerous;
         (b)   Is infested with pests or unsanitary;
         (c)   If it is a dwelling or habitation, is unfit for human
habitation;
         (d)   Is so dilapidated, defective, unsightly, or in such a condition
of deterioration or disrepair that its relocation at the proposed site would
cause appreciable harm to or be materially detrimental to the property or
improvements in the district within a radius of 1,000 feet from the proposed
site;
         (e)   If the proposed use is prohibited by the zoning laws of the
village;
         (f)   If the structure is of a type prohibited at the proposed
location by any ordinance of the village; or
         (g)   If the moving of the building or structure causes unreasonable
damage to the trees, plants, and/or shrubs on and along the public streets.
      (2)   Provided, however, that if the condition of the building or
structure, in the judgment of the Street Superintendent, admits of practicable
and effective repair, the permit may be issued upon the terms and conditions as
set forth herein.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-4)
   (E)   (1)   An inspection fee in the sum of $15 shall be paid to the Village
Clerk upon filing of each application for a house moving permit.
      (2)   A permit fee in the sum of $10 shall be paid to the Village Clerk
upon the issuance of each house moving permit.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-10)
   (F)   The Street Superintendent shall approve the issuance of a house moving
permit when all the necessary requirements and conditions of this subchapter
have been complied with. It shall then be the duty of the Village Clerk to
issue the permit.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-11)
§ 155.002 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMIT.
   (A)   When a house moving permit is granted, such terms and conditions as
may be deemed reasonable and proper may be imposed, including, but not limited
to, the public streets or other public property in the village on, over, or
through which the building or structure shall be moved, and the requirements of
changes, alterations, additions, or repairs to be made to or upon the building
or structure, to the end that the relocation thereof will not be materially
detrimental or injurious to public safety or to public welfare or to the
property and improvements, or either, in the district to which it is to be
moved.
   (B)   Such terms and conditions shall be written upon the permit or appended
in writing thereto.

   The applicant shall also deposit with the Village Clerk a cash deposit

Superintendent of trimming, moving, removing, or replanting of trees or shrubs,
and of moving, removing, and displacing any pole or other structure, supporting
any wires, cables, or other equipment belonging to the village or the cutting,

policy shall conform in all respects to the requirements of this section.
   (B)   In lieu of filing the insurance policy herein referred to, a
certificate of insurance issued by an insurance corporation may be filed. The
certificate must show that a policy meeting the requirements of this section
has been issued, and shall set forth the expiration date of said policy.
   (C)   The liability policy required under this section shall insure the
person moving a building against loss from the liability imposed by law for
injury to or death of any person, or damage to any property growing out of the
moving of such building to the amount or limit of $50,000 exclusive of interest
and costs, on account of injury to or death of any one person, of $100,000
exclusive of interest and costs, on account of moving any one building

damage to property of others, resulting from moving any one building.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-7)
§ 155.006 OWNER’S COMPLETION BOND OR SAVINGS AND LOAN CERTIFICATE AND SHARE.
   Prior to the issuance of a permit to move a building, the owner or lessee of
the property upon which the building is to be located shall file with the
Zoning Administrator or other authorized representative of the village, a
corporate surety bond, conditioned as follows.
   (A)   All of the work required to be done to complete the relocation,
alteration, and reconstruction of the building pursuant to the conditions of
the permit shall be fully performed and completed within a reasonable time to
be specified in the permit by the Zoning Administrator, or other authorized
representative of the village. Such bond shall be in principal amount equal to
the estimated cost of the work proposed to be done, plus 10% thereof, and shall
name the village as obligee, and shall be in a form approved by the Village
Attorney.
   (B)   In lieu of furnishing such a corporate surety bond, the owner or
lessee may post a cash deposit in the amount of said bond.
   (C)   An extension of time for the completion may be granted in writing by
the Zoning Administrator or other authorized representative of the village
when, in his or her discretion, circumstances shall so justify, but no such
extension shall release any surety or other security.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-8)
§ 155.007 CLEARANCE OF SITE AND SAFETY MEASURES REQUIRED.
   Prior to the issuance of a permit to move a building, the owner or lessee of
the property from which the building is to be moved shall file with the Village
Clerk a bond or other form of security in favor of the village, conditioned as
follows.
   (A)   Before any work is started on a building or structure, the permittee
or his or her authorized agent shall notify the appropriate utilities in order
that all gas, water, and oil pipelines that are to be disconnected from the
building may be securely capped and sealed.
   (B)   Immediately after the moving of any building or structure, the
permittee or his or her authorized agent shall securely barricade all basement

      (4)   Remove any buried underground tanks formerly used for storage of
flammable liquids; and
      (5)   Remove all refuse, debris, and waste materials from the property.
   (D)   The bond required by this section shall be an amount equal to the cost
of the work proposed to be done, as estimated by the Street Superintendent.
   (E)   The bond may be in the form of a corporate surety bond, cash deposit,
savings, and loan certificate, or an instrument of credit.
   (F)   An extension of time for completion of the work required by this
section may be granted by the Street Superintendent when, in his or her
discretion, circumstances justify such an extension; but no such extension
shall release any bond or other security furnished pursuant to this section.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-9)
§ 155.008 CONTROL AND SUPERVISION.
   (A)   Every building which is moved on, over, or through any public street,

the work shall be prosecuted with diligence and to the satisfaction and
approval of the Street Superintendent.
   (B)   This section in no way relieves the person having charge of the moving
of any building of his or her obligation to furnish proper supervision.
(Prior Code, § 33-9-13)
§ 155.009 NOTICE REQUIRED.
   Notice must be given to both the Street Department and the Police Department
of the village by the person or his or her representative to whom the permit is

(Prior Code, § 33-9-14)
§ 155.010 DEFAULT IN PERFORMANCE OF CONDITIONS.

done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed to be
reasonably necessary to complete such work.
      (2)   After receipt of such notice, the permittee must, within the time
therein specified, either cause the work to be done, or pay over to the Village
Clerk the estimated cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice, plus
10% of said estimated cost.
      (3)   Upon receipt of notice from the Village Clerk that the permittee
has deposited such money, the Street Superintendent shall cause the required

   (A)   A certain document, three copies of which are on file in the office of
the County Zoning Administrator, being marked and designated as “the Illinois
Accessibility Code, 1997 edition,” as published by the International Code
Council, be and is hereby adopted as the Building Code of the County Board; for
the control of buildings and structures as herein provided; and each and all of
the regulations, provisions, penalties, conditions, and terms of said State
Accessibility Code, 1997 edition, are hereby referred to, adopted, and made a
part hereof as if fully set out in this chapter, with the additions,
insertions, deletions, and changes, if any, prescribed in Division of this
Code.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-1)
   (B)   Administration and enforcement of the State Accessibility Code, 1997
edition, is hereby amended to read as follows.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-2)
§ 162.002 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known as “the Illinois Accessibility Code of
County of St. Clair” and shall be cited as such and will be referred to herein
as “this Code” and “this chapter.”
(Prior Code, § 6-8-3)
§ 162.003 PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   The purpose of this chapter and the State Accessibility Code,
being 71 Ill. Adm. Code, pt. 400, is to implement the Environmental Barriers
Act (EBA) (410 ILCS 25) as amended to date, and to replace the former version
of the Code effective May 1, 1988. This chapter is intended to ensure that the
built environment, including all spaces and elements of all applicable building
and facilities in the state is so designed, constructed, and/or altered to
assure the safety and welfare of all members of society and to be readily
accessible to, and usable by, environmentally limited persons.
      (2)   This chapter is also intended to resolve areas of difference
between the federal accessibility standards, Americans with Disabilities Act
Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), which are applicable to buildings and
facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, being 42 U.S.C.
§§ 12101 et seq.), and the Illinois Accessibility Standards (IAC) which are
applicable to buildings and facilities in the state covered by the EBA. The
drafters of this chapter compared and adopted the stricter of state or federal
accessible design standards.
   (B)   This chapter, together with the Environmental Barriers Act (EBA) and
the standards incorporated by reference identified in §
162.004, has the force of a building code and as such is law in the state.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-4)
§ 162.004 STANDARDS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.
   For projects involving alterations to historic buildings only, the Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Historic Buildings, revised
1992, United States Department of the Interior National Park Service,
Preservation Assistance Division, Washington, District of Colombia, shall
apply. The document is available from the United States Government Printing
Office, Document No. 024-005-010610-1 Washington District of Colombia 20402-
9325. It is also available from the State Historic Preservation Agency. The
Standards for Rehabilitation Historic Buildings do not include any later

(Prior Code, § 6-8-5)
§ 162.005 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter applies to all public facilities and multi-story housing
units, as defined and governed by the EBA, and located in whole or in part
within the legal geographic boundaries of the state, unless specifically
exempted herein.
   (B)   The fact that a building or facility governed by the EBA is also a
facility financed by federal funds is no bar to the application of this
chapter.
   (C)   This chapter is applicable when work involving new construction,
alterations, additions, historic preservation, restoration, or reconstruction
in whole or in part begins after the effective date of this chapter. The
chapter becomes enforceable with the signing of a construction contract,
issuance of an official authorization or permit for construction, or the start
of construction, whichever occurs first.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-6)
§ 162.006 CIVIL ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The Attorney General shall enforce the EBA and this chapter in
accordance with § 6 of the EBA. The Attorney General shall investigate any
complaint or reported violation and, where necessary to ensure compliance, may
bring an action including, but not limited to, any or all of the following:
      (1)   Mandamus;
      (2)   Injunction to halt the construction, alteration, or use of any
public facility which has been or is being constructed, altered, or leased in
violation of the EBA and this chapter;
      (3)   Injunction to halt the construction or use of any multi-story
housing unit which has been or is being constructed in violation of the EBA and
this chapter;
      (4)   Actions to require compliance with the EBA and this chapter by
private persons, state and local authorities, and other entities;
      (5)   Actions to impose civil penalties in accordance with § 7 of the
EBA; and
      (6)   Other appropriate relief (§ 6f the EBA).
   (B)   Upon receipt of a complaint, the Executive Director of the Capital
Development Board will forward it to the Attorney General. Any other person may
request the State Attorney of the county in which the public facility or multi-
story housing unit is located to initiate prosecution under § 6 of the EBA, or
may forward the complaint to the Attorney General.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-7)
§ 162.007 LOCAL STANDARDS.
   The provisions of the EBA and this chapter constitute minimum requirements
for all governmental units, including home rule units. Any governmental unit
may prescribe more stringent requirements to increase and facilitate access to
the built environment by environmentally limited persons (§ 8 of the EBA).
(Prior Code, § 6-8-8)
§ 162.008 REVISIONS TO CODE.
   This chapter may be revised from time to time by the Capital Development
Board in accordance with the State Administrative Procedure Act (5 ILCS 100)
and § 4 of the EBA.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-9)
§ 162.009 INTERPRETATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Words used in the singular number shall include the plural sense and
vice-versa.
   (B)   Unless otherwise specified in the chapter, each element or space of a
particular building or facility shall comply with the applicable requirements
of this chapter.
   (C)   Use of the terms “provide” or “shall” means the provision is
mandatory.
   (D)   Parenthetical references within this part are to the Americans with
Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines, being 36 C.F.R. § 1191.1, that
relate to the rule.
(Prior Code, § 6-8-10)

   (A)   Where permits are required for the construction or alteration of any
public facility or multi-story housing unit, the plans and specifications
submitted by the owner to obtain such a permit shall be examined for compliance
with this chapter by the administrative authority which issues the permit for
construction.
   (B)   (1)   Section 5(d) of the EBA requires a statement of compliance by
the architect/engineer unless the cost of construction or alteration is less
than $50,000.
      (2)   For privately owned work, it shall be filed with the local
