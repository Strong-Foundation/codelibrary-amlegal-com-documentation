obligation shall survive and the Village shall retain all remedies for

   (D)   By Whom Application Is Made: Application for a permit shall be made by
the owner or lessee of the building or structure, or agent of either, or by the

incurred by the Village to remove any hazard or threat to public safety that
may exist because of the abandoned construction. Nothing in this section shall

   (K)   Maintenance Of Private Sewage Disposal Systems:
      1.   After January 1, 2014, as a condition of receiving a building permit
to install a new private sewage disposal system or repair or renovate an
existing system, the property owner shall sign the permit acknowledging that
they are aware of and accept the responsibility to service and maintain the
private sewage disposal system in accordance with Village requirements.
      2.   For systems installed and permitted after January 1, 2014, the
property owner shall maintain all maintenance records on forms provided or
approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health and make records available
upon request of the Village. These records shall be transferred from owner to
owner. Records shall be kept for the life of the system.
      3.   After January 1, 2014, private sewage disposal systems installed and
permitted under this section are required to be maintained and serviced to
ensure proper operation in accordance with the following:
         a.   Septic tank to a subsurface seepage system or septic tank
followed by a sand filter discharging to a subsurface seepage system.
            (1)   Private sewage disposal system septic tanks serving
residential properties shall be evaluated prior to or within three (3) years
after the date of installation of the system. The system may be evaluated by
the homeowner, a private sewage disposal system installation contractor, a
licensed environmental health practitioner, an Illinois licensed professional
engineer, a representative of the Illinois Department of Public Health, or an
agent of the Illinois Department of Public Health. The evaluation shall
determine whether the tanks and all of the components of the private sewage
disposal system have layers of scum and settled solids greater than thirty
three percent (33%) of the liquid capacity of the tank. If the layers of scum
and settled solids are greater than thirty three percent (33%), the tanks and
compartments shall be pumped out and maintenance shall be performed. After the
first evaluation, the system shall be evaluated a minimum of once every five
(5) years. Depending on the system's use, the tanks and compartments may need
to be evaluated and pumped more frequently.
            (2)   Private sewage disposal system septic tanks serving
nonresidential property shall be evaluated within three (3) years after the
date of installation of the system. The system may be evaluated by a private
sewage disposal system installation contractor, a licensed environmental health
practitioner, an Illinois licensed professional engineer, a representative of
the department, or an agent of the department or local Health Department. The
evaluation shall determine whether the tanks and all of the compartments of the
private sewage disposal system have layers of scum and settled solids greater
than thirty three percent (33%) of the liquid capacity of the tank. If the
layers of scum and settled solids are greater than thirty three percent (33%),
the tanks and compartments shall be pumped out and maintenance shall be
performed. After the first evaluation, the system shall be evaluated at minimum
once every three (3) years. Depending on the system's use, the tanks and
compartments may need to be evaluated and pumped more frequently.
         b.   An aerobic treatment unit (ATU) requires evaluation and
maintenance at least once every six (6) months. The system may be evaluated by
a private sewage disposal system installation contractor, a licensed
environmental health practitioner, an Illinois licensed professional engineer,
a representative of the Illinois Department of Public Health, or an agent of
the Illinois Department of Public Health. The homeowner of an ATU may conduct
the inspection and maintenance as defined within the Act, but the inspection
and maintenance shall be performed per the manufacturer's requirements to
assure proper operation. If the required inspections and maintenance are not
performed, the system is in violation of the Act and this section.
         c.   Buried sand filters require an evaluation to determine whether
the tanks and all of the compartments of the private sewage disposal system
have layers of scum and settled solids greater than thirty three percent (33%)
of the liquid capacity of the tank. If the layers of scum and settled solids
are greater than thirty three percent (33%), the tanks and compartments shall
be pumped out and maintenance shall be performed. The system shall be evaluated
a minimum of once every year. The system may be evaluated by a private sewage
disposal system installation contractor, a licensed environmental health
practitioner, an Illinois licensed professional engineer, a representative of
the Illinois Department of Public Health, or an agent of the Illinois
Department of Public Health. Depending on the system's use, the tanks and
compartments may need to be evaluated and pumped more frequently.
      4.   A failure to properly operate, maintain, and have routine service
conducted on a private sewage disposal system is a violation of this title.
   (L)   Swimming Pool Wastewater:
      1.   General: Wastewater generated from the operation of a swimming pool
includes clear wastes, such as drainage from the pool proper, deck drainage,
and perimeter overflow system drainage; and turbid wastes, such as filter wash
and backwash water.
      2.   Approved Treatment And Disposal: Wastewater from swimming pools may
not be discharged to a private sewage disposal system receiving domestic
sewage. It shall be disposed of in the following manner:
         a.   Clear water wastes may be discharged directly to storm sewers,
surface drainageways or to the ground surface without additional treatment.
Such drainage shall not result in nuisance conditions including, but not
limited to, offensive odor, stagnant wet area or a breeding environment for
insects.
         b.   Wash or backwash water from an approved treatment system of
swimming pool wastewater may be discharged to natural drainage areas, storm
sewers, seepage pits, or to the ground surface. Diatomaceous earth filter wash
or backwash water may be discharged to one of the above after treatment
consisting of one of the following approved systems:
            (1)   Passing the wastewater through a separation tank designed for
removal of the diatomaceous earth and suspended solids.
            (2)   Settling the wastewater in a tank which is capable of holding
the volume of one backwash. "One backwash" is defined as the amount of water
generated from the backwash of the filters for a period of two (2) minutes for
diatomaceous earth filters, at the required backwash flow rate. The tank shall
be dewatered after settling and prior to subsequent backwashes. Settled sludge
shall be periodically removed to prevent flushing of solids during backwashing.
(See section
4-2-7-1, appendix M of this section
4-2-7.)

Notes:
   1.    Disturbed soils are highly variable and require special on site
investigations.
   2.    Moderate or strong platy structures for the soil textures in groups 4,
5, and 6 have a loading rate of 0.40 g/sq. ft./d. Platy structure having firm
or very firm consistency or caused by mechanical compaction has a loading rate
of 0.0 g/sq. ft./d.
   3.    Basal glacial tills structured by geogenic processes have the same
loading rates as structureless glacial till.
   4.    This soil group is estimated to have very rapid permeability and
exceeds the maximum established rate in appendix G, exhibit A of this section.
   5.    n/a means not applicable.
   6.    These soil groups are estimated to have moderately slow to very slow
permeability and are less than the minimum established rate in appendix G,
exhibit A of this section.
   7.    N/R means not recommended. These soils have loading rates considered
too low for conventional subsurface disposal.
   8.    In some areas, lacustrine material may have physical properties
similar to glacial till and should be placed in the glacial till columns.
   9.    Nonswelling (1:1 lattice) clays formed in bedrock residuum have a
loading rate of 0.27 g/sq. ft./d. Swelling (2:1 lattice) clays are not
recommended for subsurface disposal.

4-3-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   (A)   The President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Barrington Hills
hereby find as follows:
      1.   That excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that are
undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including, but not
limited to, the construction of buildings, the building of roads and highways
and the creation of recreational facilities;
      2.   That the washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles;
      3.   That said soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies,
washed out fills and embankments;
      4.   That the sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers and
ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs;
      5.   That said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most
beneficial purposes, destroying fish and other aquatic life and that said
sediment is costly and difficult to remove; and
      6.   That said sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways,
resulting in greatly increased chances of flooding at grave danger to public
health and safety.
   (B)   The President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Barrington Hills
therefor declare that the purpose of these regulations is to provide minimum
standards to safeguard persons, to protect property and prevent the
despoliation of the environment and to promote the public welfare by regulating
and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials and use and
maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the
topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the
Village of Barrington Hills, Illinois. (Ord. 18-09, 8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)

nonviable cover shall be used to protect areas exposed during development.
   (D)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps shall
be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land
undergoing development.
   (E)   Provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after

of any single property. In the case of redevelopment sufficient measures shall
be taken to ensure that the existing release rate does not increase. In all
cases existing watershed boundaries shall not be altered due to development.
(Ord. 18-09, 8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)
4-3-4: PLANS AND PERMIT:

Sedimentation Control Steering Committee, is hereby incorporated into this
section and made part hereof by this reference in order to provide direction as
to the consideration of factors which should enter into the preparation of a
site development plan.
   (C)   Review: To further the specific purposes of these regulations, the
following review procedures are established:
      1.   Processing Of Site Development Application: The Village Building
Officer shall review all site development applications. In so doing, the
Building Officer when necessary or appropriate may obtain assistance from and
rely on advice or determinations of the Village Engineer. Following such
review, the Building Officer, in writing, shall: a) approve the site
development application if he finds it to be in conformance with the provisions
of these regulations and issue a permit; b) approve the site development
application subject to such reasonable conditions as he may deem necessary to
secure substantially the objectives of these regulations, and issue a permit
subject to those conditions; or c) disapprove the site development application.
      2.   Prohibition Of Earth Removal: No site development permit shall be
issued for an intended building site unless:
         a.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the Village, or
         b.   The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall plan
previously approved by the Village for the area in which the site is situated.
   (D)   Appeals:
      1.   The applicant or any adjoining property owner (disregarding
intervening streets and roads) may appeal the decision of the Village Building
Officer to the Barrington Hills Plan Commission within fifteen (15) days after
the date of said decision. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Plan Commission shall
schedule and hold a public hearing after giving fifteen (15) days' published
notice thereof. Within thirty (30) days following said hearing, the Plan
Commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations in writing to the
Village President and Board of Trustees for final disposition. Factors to be
considered on review shall include, but not be limited to, possible saturation
of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; run-off
surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainage ways; excessive or
unnatural run-off; nature and type of soil or rock that, when disturbed by the
proposed grading, may create each movement and produce slopes that cannot be
landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape
through grading or removal of vegetation.
      2.   The person or persons appealing the decision of the Building Officer
shall be responsible for notifying adjoining and contiguous property owners a
minimum of fifteen (15) days in advance of the public hearing. Streets and
roads shall be disregarded in determining adjoining and contiguous properties.
If applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls the adjoining and
contiguous property, notice shall be given to the owner of the next adjoining
and contiguous property. Proof of notification shall be presented to the Plan
Commission at the time of hearing in the form of a written receipt from each
adjacent owner or proof of mailing to the last known address in the case of an
absent owner, such mailing to have been accomplished with sufficient time to
give at least fifteen (15) days' notice to the owner prior to the hearing date.
Lack of proper notification to adjacent property owners will be reason for
refusal of a hearing on the subdivision by the Plan Commission.
   (E)   Responsibility: Failure of the Village officials to observe or
recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions or to recommend denial of the site
development permit or of the Village Building Officer or Plan Commission to
deny said permit, shall not relieve the permittee from responsibility for the
condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall not result in the Village,
its officers or agents being responsible for any condition or damage resulting
therefrom.
   (F)   Retention Of Plans: Plans, specifications and reports for all site
developments shall be retained in original form by the Village Building Officer
in the Village offices.
   (G)   Inspections: The Village Building Officer shall make inspections as
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the same fails to comply with
the site development plan. Where it is found by inspection that conditions are
not substantially as stated or shown in the said plan, the Village Building
Officer may stop further work until approval is obtained for a revised site
plan conforming to the existing conditions. Plans for all work contemplated by
the site plan, bearing the stamp of approval of the Village Building Officer
shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. Until the final
inspection is made, a sign issued by the Village indicating permission to work
has been granted by the Village shall be prominently displayed on the front
property line of the property involved so as to be visible from the street on
which the property fronts. In order to obtain inspections in accordance with
the following schedule, the permittee shall notify the Village Building Officer
at least two (2) full working days before the said inspection is to be made:
      1.   Preliminary Control Work: When all erosion and sediment control
devices for each phase of site development has been completed.
      2.   Rough Grading: When all rough grading for each phase of site

specifically exempted by provisions of these regulations shall comply with the
applicable standards and requirements of this section in addition to other
requirements of these regulations.
   (B)   Green Book Adopted By Reference: The "Illinois Procedures and
Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control", excluding pages 5
- 36 of the appendix, as compiled by the Soil and Water Conservation District
of Northeastern Illinois through the Northeastern Illinois Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Steering Committee is hereby incorporated into this
section and made a part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating
procedures and methods of operation pursuant to a site development plan
approved under section
4-3-4 of this chapter. In the event of a conflict between provisions of these
regulations or other Village ordinances, the said provisions of these
regulations or other Village ordinances shall govern. (Ord. 18-09, 8-27-2018,
eff. 1-1-2019)
   (C)   Grading Requirements:
      1.   The highest proposed ground elevation at a building corner shall be
no higher than thirty six inches (36") greater than the existing
(predevelopment) ground elevation at that location except where approved by the
Village Engineer. The fill depths are not to exceed thirty six inches (36") in
accordance with section R-603.2, site preparation, from the International
Residential Code as adopted by the Village of Barrington Hills. For building
teardowns, the highest proposed ground elevation at the new building corner
shall be set at the existing ground elevation of the teardown building unless
otherwise approved by the Village Engineer. (Ord. 19-14, 7-22-2019)
      2.   The proposed ground elevation at a building corner may exceed the
limit of thirty six inches (36") above existing (predevelopment) ground
elevations under the following conditions:
         a.   The allowable increase in ground elevation may be further
increased by twenty four inches (24") where habitable space and/or sleeping
room/bedroom are proposed below finished elevation.
         b.   Where an increase in ground elevation of thirty six inches (36")
(or 60 inches when applying the criteria of subsection (C)2a of this section)
results in a finished elevation that is twelve inches (12") or more below the
finished floor elevations of two (2) or more adjoining properties, an
additional increase in proposed ground elevation of up to twelve inches (12")
may be approved by the Village Engineer.
         c.   Where an increase in ground elevation of thirty six inches (36")
(or the highest allowable increase in ground elevation when applying the
criteria of subsections (C)2a and (C)2b of this section) results in a finished
floor elevation that is below the elevation of the adjacent roadway to which
drainage is directed, an additional twelve inch (12") increase in proposed
ground elevation may be approved by the Village Engineer.
         d.   The requirements above do not relieve the applicant from meeting
the requirements of horizontal setback from the watercourses per subsection
5-3-9(E) of this Code or the vertical separation requirements of chapter 5 of
this title.
      3.   Where the proposed increase in ground elevations exceed the increase
allowable under subsections (C)1 and (C)2 of this section, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the proposed
release rate is equal to or less than the release rate that would result from
meeting the requirements of the aforementioned subsections; otherwise the
provisions of section
4-3-6 of this chapter shall apply.
   (D)   Special Precautions:
      1.   If, at any stage of the work, the Village Building Officer
determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further
work, as authorized by an existing permit, is likely to imperil any property,
public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the Village Building Officer may
require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the likelihood of such
peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to,
specifying a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of plant
materials for erosion control and reports of an engineer whose recommendations
may be made requirements for further work.
      2.   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the work is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety. On large operations or where unusual
site conditions prevail, the Village Building Officer may specify the time to
start grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be
conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures
or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
   (E)   Expiration Of Permit: Every site development permit shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has
not commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days or is not completed within
one year from date of issue; except that the Building Officer may, if the
permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have
prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits,
grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the
expiration date of the permit. (Ord. 18-09, 8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)

filed with the Building Officer together with the site development permit
application. Notice of filing of an exception application shall be given to
contiguous owners as required under subsection
4-3-4(D) of this chapter. In order for the land referred to in the petition to
come within the provisions of this section, it shall be necessary that the
Barrington Hills Plan Commission find all of the following facts with respect
thereto:
      1.   That the land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record that it
is impossible or impractical for the subdivider to comply with all of the
regulations of this chapter.
      2.   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the petitioner.
      3.   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property.
   (C)   Referral Of Proposed Exception: Each proposed exception shall be
referred to the Village Engineer, Village Planner, Village Attorney and any
others involved, and such officers or departments shall transmit to the
Barrington Hills Plan Commission their recommendations, which recommendations
shall be reviewed prior to the granting of any exception.

12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8, and 5/11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to
maintain this Village's eligibility in the national flood insurance program; to
minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss
of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in
order to accomplish the following specific purposes:
   (A)   To meet the requirements of the Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act 1 ;
   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   (F)   To make Federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the Village by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance
program;
   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood
insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59 - 79, as amended;
   (H)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   (I)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development. (Ord. 18-09, 8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)
 
Notes
1 1. 615 ILCS 5/1 et seq.
4-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT: The Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act 1 .
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and
will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are
as specified in subsection
4-5-7(B) of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
4-5-5 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank,
that is principally above ground, including manufactured homes, prefabricated
buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days per year.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this part, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA
will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries
or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or flood
insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes
through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on
the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year
frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to
the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in velocities.
   (A)   The floodways are designated for on the Countywide flood insurance
rate map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in effect from
time to time as listed in appendix A on file in the Village, as maintained by
the Village Clerk. When two (2) floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more
restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
   (B)   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook, Kane, Lake, and
McHenry Counties that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the
Village that may be annexed into the Village are designated for the Fox River,
Flint Creek, and Spring Creek on the Countywide flood insurance rate map
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in effect from time to
time as listed in appendix A on file in the Village, as maintained by the
Village Clerk.
   (C)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated
floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located
on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation
is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:
   (A)   Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building or
any addition to a building.
   (B)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. If the travel trailer or
recreational vehicle is on site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, it
must be fully licensed and ready for highway use.
   (C)   Drilling, mining, installing utilities, construction of roads,
bridges, or similar projects.
   (D)   Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site.
   (E)   Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction.
   (F)   Construction or erection of levees, walls, fences, dams, or culverts;
channel modification; filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving, or other
nonagricultural alterations of the ground surface; storage of materials;
deposit of solid or liquid waste.
   (G)   Any other activity of man that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface water, including extensive vegetation removal.
   (H)   Substantial improvement of an existing building.
Development does not include routine maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities such as reroofing or resurfacing of roads when there is no increase
in elevation, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do
not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.

built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other
similar vehicles placed on site for more than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational
vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MITIGATION: Includes those measures necessary to minimize the negative effects
which floodplain development activities might have on the public health, safety
and welfare. Examples of mitigation include: excavation of compensatory
storage, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and channel restoration.
Mitigation may also include those activities taken to reduce a structure's
susceptibility to flooding.

Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD).
NATURAL: When used in reference to channels means those channels formed by the
existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross section of the
stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some
natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is
reestablished. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural
conditions by man through regrading and revegetation.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a
community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: Manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) has been completed on or after April
1, 1990.
ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK (OHWM): The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave a
distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized
characteristics.
PUBLIC BODIES OF WATERS: All open public streams and lakes capable of being
navigated by watercraft, in whole or in part, for commercial uses and purposes,
and all lakes, rivers, and streams which in their natural condition were
capable of being improved and made navigable, or that are connected with or
discharge their waters into navigable lakes or rivers within, or upon the
borders of the State of Illinois, together with all bayous, sloughs,
backwaters, and submerged lands that are open to the main channel or body of
water directly accessible thereto.
PUBLIC FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT: A flood control project which will be operated
and maintained by a public agency to reduce flood damages to existing buildings
and structures, including a hydrologic and hydraulic study of the existing and
proposed conditions of the watershed. Nothing in this definition shall preclude
the design, engineering, construction or financing, in whole or in part, of a
flood control project by persons or parties who are not public agencies.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE OR TRAVEL TRAILER: A vehicle which is:
   (A)   Built on a single chassis;
   (B)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   (C)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   (D)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGIONAL PERMITS: Offered for preapproved projects which are considered minor
projects that are permissible per IDNR/OWR part 3708 rules for Northeastern
Illinois regulatory floodways. A complete listing of the terms and conditions
for specific project types can be obtained from the IDNR/OWR website.
REGISTERED LAND SURVEYOR: A land surveyor registered in the State of Illinois,
under the Illinois Land Surveyors Act 2 .
REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER: An engineer registered in the State of
Illinois, under the Illinois Professional Engineering Practice Act 3 .

in any increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any changes to the
dimensions of a structure.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damaged
occurred.
RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A retention facility stores stormwater runoff
without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for storage of
stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a
flood or storm.
RIVERINE SFHA: Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent
stream, ditch, on stream lake system or any other identified channel. This term
does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes, ponding areas, areas of
sheet flow, or other areas not subject to overbank flooding.
RUNOFF: The water derived from melting snow or rain falling on the land
surface, flowing over the surface of the ground or collected in channels or
conduits.
SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris, and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water or watercourses.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): See definition of floodplain.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage during the life of the building equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination. The term includes repetitive
loss buildings. See definition of repetitive loss.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure taking place during the life of the building which
the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%)
of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started.
   (A)   "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building. This term includes structures which have incurred
repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done.
   (B)   The term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or
local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
2. Any alteration of a "historic structure" listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
TRANSITION SECTION: Reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a
narrow cross section to a wide cross section or vice versa.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure

4-5-3: HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER:
   (A)   The Village Engineer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the
duties listed in section
4-5-4 of this chapter.
   (B)   To fulfill those duties, the Village Engineer should first use the
criteria listed in section
4-5-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain.
   (C)   Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the Village Engineer must determine whether the development site is
within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or floodplain
for which no floodway has been identified.
      1.   If the site is within a flood fringe, the Village Engineer shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
4-5-6 of this chapter be met.
      2.   If the site is within a floodway, the Village Engineer shall require
that the minimum requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter be met.
      3.   If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the Village Engineer shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
4-5-8 of this chapter be met.
   (D)   In addition, the general requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
4-5-6,
4-5-7, or
4-5-8 of this chapter.
   (E)   The Village Engineer shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall
meet the requirements of section
4-5-10 of this chapter.
   (F)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Village Engineer
shall review the requirements of section
4-5-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the Village
Engineer shall complete all notification requirements.
   (G)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the Village Engineer may take any and all actions as outlined in
section
4-5-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 18-09, 8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)
4-5-4: DUTIES OF THE VILLAGE ENGINEER:
   (A)   Determining The Floodplain Designation:
      1.   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
      2.   If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
      3.   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA
(with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the development
would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which
would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain
and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter.
   (B)   Professional Engineer Review:
      1.   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to a registered professional engineer
under the employ or contract of the Village for review to ensure that the
development meets section
4-5-7 or
4-5-8 of this chapter.
      2.   In the case of an appropriate use, the professional engineer shall
state in writing that the development meets the requirements of section
4-5-7 of this chapter.
   (C)   Dam Safety Requirements:
      1.   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage
potential in the event of failure.
      2.   The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard)
and Class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
      3.   Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel detention basins that
have an embankment are nonjurisdictional Class III dams. It is not required
that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all nonjurisdictional Class III dams.
      4.   A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a
hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is
required.
      5.   A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the
construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
      6.   Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures.
   (D)   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required Federal, State
and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   (E)   Plan Review And Permit Issuance:
      1.   Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the Village meet the requirements of this chapter; and
      2.   Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   (F)   Inspection Review:
      1.   Inspect all development projects before, during and after
construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
      2.   Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and
document the results of the inspection.
   (G)   Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged
buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with subsection
4-5-9(C) of this chapter.
   (H)   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain permit files
including:
      1.   An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject
to section
4-5-9 of this chapter; and/or
      2.   The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to
section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
   (I)   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies
of Federal or State permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as
built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   (J)   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections
4-5-7 and
4-5-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the Village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the
Village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      1.   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      2.   Dams and all other State, Federal or local unit of government
projects, including projects of the Village and County, except for those
projects meeting the requirements of subsection
4-5-7(B)1 of this chapter;
      3.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per subsection
4-5-7(B)3e of this chapter;
      4.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection
4-5-7(B)3d of this chapter;
      5.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage as indicated in subsection
4-5-7(B)3 of this chapter;
      6.   Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly
navigable rivers, lakes and streams;
      7.   Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles.
   (K)   Cooperation With Other Agencies:
      1.   Cooperate with State and Federal floodplain management agencies to
improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve
the administration of this chapter;
      2.   Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a
regulatory map within six (6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain
may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain
map;
      3.   Submit reports as required for the national flood insurance program;
and
      4.   Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
   (L)   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter changes. (Ord. 18-
09, 8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)
4-5-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for
the Village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is
not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from Federal, State or other
sources. When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit
a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any
development of the site.
   (A)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
the Fox River, Flint Creek, and Spring Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-
year flood profiles in the flood insurance rate map prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, in effect from time to time as listed in appendix
A on file in the Village, as maintained by the Village Clerk, and such
amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook, Kane, Lake, and McHenry Counties that are
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed
into the Village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
flood insurance rate map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
in effect from time to time as listed in appendix A on file in the Village, as
maintained by the Village Clerk, and such amendments or revisions to such study
and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the Countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook, Kane, Lake, and
McHenry Counties.
   (D)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the Countywide flood insurance
rate map of Cook, Lake, Kane, and McHenry Counties shall be according to the
best existing data available from Federal, State or other sources. Should no
other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to
determine base flood elevations.
      1.   When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be
determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model
such as HIP.
      2.   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques
presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological
Survey for estimating peak flood discharges.
      3.   For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the
historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed
engineering study.
      4.   For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1
square mile) which has been identified by the Village Engineer pursuant to
subsection
4-5-4(A)3 of this chapter, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the
applicant utilizing a method as approved in this subsection (D). (Ord. 18-09,
8-27-2018, eff. 1-1-2019)
4-5-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
   (A)   Development Permit:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the Village.
      2.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Village.
         a.   The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations, using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings.
         b.   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
      3.   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Village shall
compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation.
         a.   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
         b.   The Village shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
identification.
      4.   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall
be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
      5.   The applicant shall submit copies of all other Federal, State, and
local permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of
activity to the Village. The Village shall not issue a permit unless all other
Federal, State, and local permits have been obtained.
   (B)   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      1.   Fill: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient
data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of
removing the site from the floodplain.
      2.   Compensatory Storage:
         a.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
         b.   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
         c.   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
         d.   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
         e.   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   (C)   Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE):
A person who has obtained an LOMR based on fill that removes a site in the
flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site
above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the Village to construct the lowest
floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The Village
Engineer shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with
all the criteria set forth in the following subsections:
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection (B) of this
section.
      2.   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
      3.   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the
FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the Village may waive the ten foot (10') minimum setback if an Illinois
registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to
protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The
certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design
analysis, which shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for review. The
Village may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that
the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe.
In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet (4').
      4.   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained,
the Village may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback distance if an
Illinois registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method
to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been
met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter
setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall
be submitted to the Village for review. In no case shall the setback distance
be less than four feet (4').
      5.   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under
the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of an LOMR-
F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering purposes.
      6.   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the
same direction.
      7.   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois registered professional engineer, as warranted by the
site conditions.
      8.   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five (5) below the BFE.
      9.   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and
minimum of one-fourth (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4)
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      10.   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      11.   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
      12.   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the Village may allow the
construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates
that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set
forth in FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding.
In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from
flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the
proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be
completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA technical bulletin 10-
01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois registered
professional engineer.
      13.   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural
grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation,
if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. 18-09, 8-27-
2018, eff. 1-1-2019)
4-5-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF DESIGNATED FLOODWAYS:
This section applies to proposed development, redevelopment, site modification
or building modification within a designated floodway. The designated floodway
for the Fox River, Flint Creek, and Spring Creek shall be as delineated on the
Countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook, Lake, Kane, and McHenry Counties.
Only those uses and structures will be permitted which meet the criteria in
this section. All floodway modifications shall be the minimum necessary to
accomplish the purpose of the project. The development shall also meet the
requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter.
   (A)   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by State law shall commence any development in a floodway without
first obtaining a development permit from the Village and IDNR/OWR.
      1.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Village. The application shall include the following
information:
         a.   Name and address of applicant;
         b.   Site location (including legal description) of the property,
drawn to scale, on the designated floodway map, indicating whether it is
proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;

   (B)   Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses:
      1.   The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or
impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or
channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Illinois
Administrative Code part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses
are as follows:
         a.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
         b.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
         c.   Storm and sanitary sewer relief curtails;
         d.   Underground and overhead utilities;
         e.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any 1
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         f.   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         g.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
         h.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            (1)   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event
will not exceed 1.0 foot; or
            (2)   The applicant of a short term recreational use facility
parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all
overbank flooding events;
         i.   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a watercourse;
         j.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure;
         k.   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation;
         l.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      2.   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
      3.   Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate
use will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer
and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section
4-5-9 of this chapter:
         a.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood
Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            (1)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where
"n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, "Open Channel Hydraulics" (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959).)
            (2)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a Federal,
State, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
            (3)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               A.    When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
               B.    When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
               C.    When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet
(10') of stream length shall be used.
               D.    Transition sections shall be provided between cross
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
               E.    All cross sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         b.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding:
            (1)   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            (2)   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            (3)   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
            (4)   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
            (5)   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the
location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall
demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface
elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            (6)   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at existing structure.
         c.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights:
            (1)   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
            (2)   In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
         d.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches:
            (1)   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements.
            (2)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
               A.    The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
4-5-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly
accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
               B.    Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per
subsection (B)3b of this section.
               C.    Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (B)3c
of this section.
               D.    If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is
used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be
received.
               E.    The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
subsection (B).
               F.    All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed per subsection (B)3h of this section.
         e.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And
Approach Roads:
            (1)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
            (2)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            (3)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Illinois Administrative Code part 3708 (floodway
construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued.
         f.   On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
            (1)   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within
recorded flood easements.
            (2)   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must
be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            (3)   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section
300.16 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois Administrative
Code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity
involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
               A.    The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater
detention;
               B.    The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               C.    The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation
basin;
               D.    A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
               E.    The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
this section.
         g.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures:
            (1)   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of
the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building.
            (2)   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be
required for floodproofing activities.
         h.   Excavation In The Floodway:
            (1)   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
            (2)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               A.    When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
and
               B.    When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length; and
               C.    When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet
(10') of stream length shall be used; and
               D.    Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         i.   Activity Involving A Channel Modification: If the proposed
activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
            (1)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a stream side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat;
            (2)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
            (3)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
               A.    The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
               B.    Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they
will prevent erosion.
               C.    One sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
               D.    Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to
that which is essential for construction of the channel.
               E.    Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or riprap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete,
gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
               F.    All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               G.    If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
               H.    A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               I.    New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
               J.    There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               K.    Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
            (4)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         j.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
         k.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
            (1)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the initiation of improvements.
            (2)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be
applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization
shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any
portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may
not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60)
days.
            (3)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
            (4)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25')
in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along
existing channels (see 802.3.16). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be
minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to
minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be
restabilized immediately.
            (5)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
         l.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         m.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
            (1)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in section
4-5-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the
study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be
contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data
to use.
            (2)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               A.    The requirements of this section for the 100-year
frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               B.    Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
               C.    If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments,
or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled
to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         n.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision:
            (1)   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
            (2)   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
            (3)   In the case of nongovernment projects, the Municipality in
incorporated areas and the County in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            (4)   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
            (5)   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         o.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
         p.   Construction Within Twenty Five Feet Of Channel: For all
activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25')
of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
            (1)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within
at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            (2)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during
the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         q.   After Conditional Approval And Issuance Of Permit: After receipt
of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a
permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to
change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or
other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area
until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision
is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and
concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.
   (C)   Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State
Review: For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or
county delegated State permitting authority in the floodway.
      1.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge
pursuant to subsection (B)3d of this section.

The intent of this chapter is to ensure the presence, conservation and
perpetuation of heritage trees within the Village, and to educate residents
about their existence and the importance of protecting them. Heritage trees are
a unique natural resource found throughout the Village of Barrington Hills that
have a positive impact on animal habitat, air and soil quality, as well as
watershed and invasive species management. By preventing situations that may
substantially alter the natural environment, the Village aims to protect the
health, safety and welfare of residents, while also ensuring that they may
continue to enjoy all the benefits of living in the unique environment of
Barrington Hills. This may be accomplished by regulating how heritage trees may
be removed and replaced, as a result of building construction and/or landscape
activity. (Ord. 19-14, 7-22-2019)

required for the destruction or removal of any heritage tree in any woodland.
No person shall, directly or indirectly remove, damage or destroy a woodland
without having secured a TRP.
   (B)   Exemption:
      1.   This chapter shall not apply to the removal of woodlands pursuant to
a forestry management plan or nursery stock plan that is approved and
administered by a governmental agency with jurisdiction over such matters.
      2.   This chapter shall not apply to the removal of woodlands on property
owned by a common owner, either singularly, collectively or institutionally,
which exceeds one hundred (100) acres of contiguous land in the Village so long
as the property is subject to a tree preservation plan acceptable to the
Village. Such a plan, which shall have been prepared by or endorsed by a
certified arborist or certified forester, may be accepted by the Village's Plan
Commission and shall, at a minimum, include the forestry management practices
found in subsections
4-6-8(C), table C and (D), table D of this chapter to preserve and protect
heritage trees.
   (C)   Application And Fee: A TRP application on the prescribed form shall be
submitted to the Village Building Officer with the permit fee established by
the Village.
   (D)   Application Procedure:
      1.   Construction Permit: The applicant shall submit a tree preservation
plan ("TPP") to the Village Building Officer with his application for a TRP in
conjunction with construction when a building permit is required by the
provisions of this title.
         a.   The TPP shall consist of two (2) legible reproducible site plans,
drawn to scale, of a tree survey of all heritage trees in a woodland overlaid
directly upon the site plan including the location, species, dbh, and condition
as rated in accordance with the standards in subsection
4-6-8(B), table B of this chapter.
The survey shall distinguish among the heritage trees to be preserved,
transplanted, or destroyed. Groups of trees which are less than three feet (3')
apart may be designed by clumps, provided that all heritage trees and all other
trees with a dbh of twelve inches (12") or greater shall be individually
depicted on the TPP.
         b.   The Building Officer in consultation with the Village Arborist
may permit the TPP to exclude areas of the site from the tree survey if he
determines that the proposed construction or other activity will not impact
those areas.
         c.   The TPP shall include a maintenance plan for all heritage trees,
consistent with the forestry practices found in subsections
4-6-8(C), table C and (D), table D of this chapter, to ensure the protection of
the trees for a period of at least three (3) growing seasons from the issuance
of an occupancy permit, if one is required.
      2.   Non-Construction Permit: When no building permit is required, the
applicant shall submit the following with his application for a tree removal
permit ("TRP"):
         a.   Site plan that depicts the area of the tree removal, the heritage
trees to be removed, and all other heritage trees whose minimum root zone is
within the tree removal area. All heritage trees shall be identified by
location, species, dbh, and condition as rated in accordance with the standards
in subsection
4-6-8(B), table B of this chapter.
         b.   Reasons for removing the heritage trees, including reports or
studies, if any, indicating that the trees should be removed.
      3.   Application Review: Upon receipt of a completed application
including the TPP and the required fee, the Building Officer shall review the
application, which, if deemed necessary, may include a site inspection by the
Village Arborist.
   (E)   Escrow:
      1.   If tree replacement is required by this chapter, then as a condition
of the TRP, the applicant shall place into escrow with the Village an amount of
money in cash equal to the tree replacement value, as determined by the Village
Arborist. In the event the tree replacement value is greater than one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00) a bond in a form acceptable to the Village, may
be utilized in lieu of a cash escrow. The money shall be returned, or the bond
released, once the new tree(s) are planted. Failure to plant the tree(s) in
compliance with the TRP within one growing season shall result in forfeiture of
the escrow or bond, which shall then be used by the Village to plant as
required by the TRP. Access to the applicant's property shall be granted for
such work to be completed in accordance with the TRP. The Village Arborist
shall maintain a current schedule of cost including planting expenses for
replacement of trees.
      2.   If it is determined that practices which violate any portion of the
village code have resulted in tree damage, then the village may require an
escrow payment or tender of a bond (if the amount at issue exceeds one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00)) in a form acceptable to the Village by made to
the village, equal to the replacement value of the damaged tree(s) as
determined by the Village Arborist. The cash escrow or bond shall be held by
the village for the purpose of assuring that all remedial actions required by
the village to restore the health of the tree(s) are taken, and/or for the
purpose of assuring the appropriate tree replacement should any damaged trees
die or show noticeable signs of decline as determined by the Village Arborist.
(Ord. 19-14, 7-22-2019; amd. Ord. 23-03, 4-24-2023)

   (A)   The Building Officer shall grant a TRP only if:
      1.   All reasonable efforts have been undertaken in the architectural
layout and design of the proposed construction or other activity to preserve
woodlands; or
      2.   The removal of the heritage trees is consistent with sound forestry
practice found in subsection
4-6-8(C), table C of this chapter or will result in the enhancement of the
woodland; and
      3.   The transplanting of the woodlands is not feasible.
   (B)   As a condition to granting a TRP, the applicant shall be required to
replace the heritage trees that will be destroyed in accordance with section
4-6-6 of this chapter with those tree species identified in subsection
4-6-8(A), table A of this chapter. Replacement trees shall be acquired and
planted in conformance with subsections
4-6-8(C), table C and (D), table D of this chapter.
   (C)   A TRP shall expire and become null and void if work authorized by the
TRP is not commenced within one growing season from the date of issuance of the
TRP or if such work, when commenced, is suspended or abandoned at any time for
a period of ninety (90) days.
   (D)   Except as set forth herein no certificate of compliance as required by
section
5-10-3 of this Code shall be issued until any required replacement of heritage
trees, as required by the TRP, has been completed and after three (3) growing
seasons, the final tree inspection approval has been given by the Building
Officer in consultation with the Village Arborist.
      1.   Exception: Upon good cause shown as to why the required replacement
of heritage trees has not been completed, the Building Officer may issue a
temporary certificate of compliance for a period of six (6) months until the
TRP has been completed, and final tree inspection conducted. In addition to the
loss of the cash escrow required by subsection
4-6-3(E) of this chapter, the failure to complete the TRP within the six (6)
month extension period shall result in a violation of this chapter, and shall
be subject to the general penalty procedures provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code.
   (E)   In the event the completion of the required TPP is prevented by
seasonal weather conditions, or availability of plant stock, the Building
Officer in consultation with the Village Arborist may extend the date of
completion by six (6) months into the next growing season.

conditions under which forestry activities are occurring on the site and any
other information that may assist in the identification of the TRP. (Ord. 19-
14, 7-22-2019)
4-6-5: CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
   (A)   During construction, the TPP shall be followed to prevent the
destruction or damaging of heritage trees including unless otherwise authorized
by the TPP, a fence erected and maintained so that no excess soil, additional
fill, equipment, liquids, or construction debris shall be placed within the
minimum root zone of any heritage tree, unless the addition of excess soil or
fill is required in order to comply with the Lake County Watershed Development
Ordinance found in section
4-2-10 of this title.
   (B)   Until the issuance of the certificate of compliance, the area of the
site included within a TPP shall not have other plantings or landscape
additions that prevent as determined by the Building Officer the planting of
the required replacement heritage trees.
   (C)   Heritage trees in a TPP that are removed or receive major damage as
determined by the Building Officer in consultation with the Village Arborist
shall be required to be replaced by heritage trees of equal dbh in the
aggregate, in accordance with section
4-6-6 of this chapter, with those tree species identified in subsection
4-6-8(A), table A of this chapter. Replacement trees shall be acquired and

provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code, he shall plant, within the growing season, a replacement
tree or trees on the site within ninety (90) days of written notice from the
Village. The failure to plant the replacement trees shall constitute a
violation of this chapter and each day that the replacement tree is not planted
shall constitute a separate offense.
      2.   The replacement tree or trees required by this section shall be a
species listed in subsection
4-6-8(A), table A of this chapter and the replacement trees shall equal the
aggregate dbh of the damaged or removed heritage tree. Replacement trees shall
be acquired and planted in conformance with subsections
4-6-8(C), table C and (D), table D of this chapter.
      3.   Replacement trees required by this section shall be maintained alive
and healthy on the site for three (3) growing seasons. Methods should be used
as found in subsection
4-6-8(D), table D of this chapter to provide for protection of the replacement
trees from deer. Any replacement tree(s) which die or become severely damaged
before the end of the third growing season of planting upon written notice from

CHAPTER 7
NEW CONSTRUCTION/DEMOLITION
SECTION:
4-7-1: Authorization
4-7-2: Permit
4-7-1: AUTHORIZATION:
When specific circumstances exist which can allow for same, the Building and
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall be authorized to allow the continued occupancy
of an existing residential structure during construction of a new residential
structure on the same property. (Ord. 19-02, 1-28-2019)
4-7-2: PERMIT:
   (A)   Application: In addition to any permit required by section
4-1-2 of this title, the owner shall be required to apply for a new
construction/demolition permit when the owner seeks to continue to reside in an
existing residential structure during construction of a new residential
structure on the same property. In making such application, the owner shall
provide such plans as are required to establish the ability to retain an
existing residential structure without impeding the construction of a new
residential structure on the lot or impacting the safety of those living and/or
working on the lot.
      1.   Existing Occupancy: Occupancy of an existing residential structure
during construction of a new residential structure shall only be allowed to
occur for a period of nineteen (19) months, unless application is made to the
Building Department for an extension of time, and good cause is shown therefor.
For purposes of such extension, application must be made in writing to the
Building Department no later than thirty (30) days prior to last date allowed
for occupancy. The Building and Enforcement Officer may issue such extension
only in compliance with this chapter for the period deemed necessary to
accommodate the circumstance claimed, and upon payment of a fee of two hundred
dollars ($200.00) for purposes of the extension. No more than two (2) such
extensions can be granted.
      2.   Escrow:
         a.   As a condition of the grant of the new construction/demolition
permit, the applicant shall place into escrow with the Village an amount of
money in cash equal to the cost of demolition of the existing residential
structure, plus ten percent (10%). The Village shall place said sum into a non-
interest-bearing escrow account held by the Village for such purpose. Said
escrow sum shall be determined by the Building Department, based on the
applicant's tender to the Building Department of no less than two (2) estimates
for demolition of the structure. The escrowed funds shall be returned to the
applicant upon completion of the demolition to the requirements of the Village.
The escrow requirement may also be met by tender of a Letter of Credit of
Performance Bond for the same purposes and in the same amounts with the Village
in a form acceptable to the Village. Such escrow shall be available for use by
the Village to compel demolition of the existing structure, which shall include
but not limited to, payment of the Village's legal fees and court costs.
         b.   At the time of completion of the new residential structure, the
applicant may apply for a temporary occupancy permit to inhabit the new
structure, in accordance with the provisions of section
4-1-6 of this title. Within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the temporary
occupancy permit, the initial residential structure shall be demolished in
accordance with the provisions set forth in this chapter, and in compliance
with all other applicable Code requirements.
   (B)   Issuance Of Permit: No permit shall be issued unless the application
and supporting documentation are in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter and all other provisions of this Code and unless the applicable fee in
section
4-1-6 of this title has been paid. Cost of said permit shall be one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   (C)   Form Of Application: Application for such permit shall be made to the
Building Department with the number of copies from time to time required, upon
the form prepared by the Village.
   (D)   Decision On Application: The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall render his decision on the application within sixty (60) days of the date
it was submitted, unless the time becomes extended due to negotiations with the
applicant for changes to the application to bring it into compliance with this
chapter. In granting approval of the application, the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer may add any condition to the permit deemed necessary to
protect the owner and the Village during construction of the new residential
structure, and which is believed proper to ensure compliance with all other
sections of this Code. In the event the Building and Enforcement Officer

      1.   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date hereof, accessory parking and loading
facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the districts in
which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building permit has
been issued prior to the effective date hereof, and provided that construction
is begun within six (6) months of such effective date and diligently prosecuted
to completion, parking and loading facilities in the amount required for
issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different
amounts required by this zoning title.
      2.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking or loading facilities as required herein
shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. However, no building
or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the
effective date hereof shall be required to provide such additional parking or
loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units of
measurement shall equal not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the units of
measurement existing upon the effective date hereof, in which event, parking or
loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for the total increase;
provided, however, that in the case of the expansion or alteration of
residential buildings, required parking or loading facilities shall be provided
on the basis of the total required units of measurement for the entire capacity
of the building.

be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure was
erected prior to the effective date hereof, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the
new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to
the parking and loading provisions of this title.
   (B)   Existing Parking Facilities: Accessory off street parking facilities
in existence on the effective date hereof and located on the same lot as the
building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less
than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a similar new
building or use under the provisions of this title.
   (C)   Permissive Parking And Loading Facilities: Nothing in this title shall
be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings; provided,
that all regulations herein governing the location, design and operation of
such facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage Or Destruction: For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date hereof, which
subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or
other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off street
parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking or
loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this zoning title for equivalent new uses or
construction.
   (E)   Control Of Off Site Parking Facilities: In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either deed or long
term lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the zoning board of
appeals. The owner of the land on which the parking facilities are to be
located shall be bound by covenant filed on the record in the office of the
recorder of deeds or the registrar of titles of that county or counties in
which said land is situated, requiring such owner, his heirs and assigns, to
maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use
served or of the said lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
   (F)   Submission Of Plot Plan: Any application for a building permit, or for
a certificate of compliance where no building permit is required, shall include
therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any
parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this zoning
title. (Ord. 63-1, 4-1-1963)

and practices which will minimize light pollution and will conserve energy and
resources while maintaining nighttime health, safety, utility and security. It
is also intended for this section to provide regulations which will protect the
health and welfare of the general public and protect the ecological and natural
resources of the village, while preserving the ability to view the celestial
features of the night sky for present and future generations.
Village authorities recognize:
      1.   The need to safeguard the rural character, aesthetic value and the
unique quality of life that village residents enjoy by preserving and enhancing
the ability to view the night sky.
      2.   The night sky as a natural resource.
      3.   The need to define limits and protect residents from the trespass of
excessive and misdirected light from adjacent properties.
      4.   That proper direction and use of light minimizes the use of energy.
      5.   That excessive illumination may have a detrimental effect on
wildlife that depends on the natural cycle of the day and night for survival.
      6.   The importance to all of astronomical observations and the enjoyment
of the night sky.
   (B)   Definitions: Terms used in this section shall be defined as follows:
   BACK SIDE SHIELD: A device which is added or attached to a light fixture
made from an opaque material which prevents light from being emitted in certain
directions. Commonly applied to prevent light from entering an adjacent
property.
   DOORWAY: Any means of ingress or egress to any structure, limited to doors
and garage doors.
   DOORWAY LIGHTING: Light fixtures located within ten feet (10') of a doorway.
   ESSENTIAL LIGHTING: Light that is used for a specified period of time which
is necessary for a specific task or purpose while said task or purpose is
actively being performed.
   EXCESSIVE LIGHTING: Illuminance which exceeds the amount of light which is
needed to perform a visual task or purpose at night.
   EXTERIOR LIGHTING: Temporary or permanent lighting that is installed,
located or used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outdoors.
Fixtures which are located indoors, but which are intended to illuminate
something outside are considered exterior lighting for the purposes of this
section.
   FIXTURE, LIGHT FIXTURE (Also Called LUMINAIRE): The complete lighting
assembly (including the lamp(s), housing, ballasts, photocells, reflectors or
refractors, lenses, sensors and shields) less the support assembly or pole,
mounting bracket and base, consisting of one or more lamps together with the
parts designed to distribute light, position and protect the lamp, and connect
the lamp to a source of power. Light fixtures are evaluated for safety by
Underwriters Laboratories and are "rated" to certain wattage limits, as affixed
by a UL issued label.
   FOOT-CANDLE: A unit of measurement used to determine the amount of light
incident on a surface, also known as "illuminance". One foot-candle (1 fc) is
equivalent to one lumen evenly distributed over one square foot of surface area
at a distance of one foot (1'). Foot-candle measurements can be taken with a
handheld light meter.
   FULLY SHIELDED: A light fixture or luminaire designed, constructed and
installed in such a manner that all light emitted from the fixture, either
directly from the lamp(s) or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection
or refraction from any part of the fixture, is projected below the horizontal
plane through the fixture's lowest light emitting part.
   GLARE: A visual disturbance produced by a distinct light source within the
visual field that is sufficiently brighter than the level to which the eyes are
adapted.
   HOLIDAY LIGHTING: Temporary lighting installed in connection with a holiday
or religious observance and removed thereafter.
   ILLUMINANCE: The amount of luminous flux falling onto a unit of surface
area, correlating to the perception of brightness by the human eye. Illuminance
is typically measured in lumens per square foot (foot-candles) or lumens per
square meter (flux).
   LAMP: The source of light being emitted from a luminaire, such as a bulb.
   LANDSCAPE LIGHTING: Exterior lighting for the purpose of illuminating trees,
shrubbery, plants, flowerbeds, waterways, gardens and nonstructural, manmade
features, including, but not limited to, sculptures, fountains, trellises,
statuaries, tree houses and other features.
   LIGHT LEVEL: The illuminance as measured by a light meter as reported in
photometry.
   LIGHT OUTPUT: The amount of light which is emitted by a lamp or fixture.
   LIGHT POLLUTION: Any unnecessary or adverse effect of artificial light
including, but not limited to, glare, light trespass, excessive lighting,
uplighting and skyglow, and any artificial light that unnecessarily diminishes
the ability to view the night sky or is disruptive to the natural environment.
   LIGHT SOURCE OR SOURCE: The light emitting part or parts of a light fixture,
consisting of the lamp or lamps and any transparent or translucent covering
over the lamp, as well as any refractors, reflectors, prismatic lenses,
mirrors, or diffusers which emit or transmit light.
   LIGHT TRESPASS: Light that falls on neighboring properties or produces glare
or distraction for observers away from the area for which the light is
intended.
   LIGHTING: Any or all parts of a luminaire that function to produce light or
light produced by a manmade source, including, but not limited to, electric
lamps, gas lamps and solar lamps.
   LUMEN: The unit of measurement used to quantify the amount of light produced
by a lamp or emitted from a fixture (as distinct from "watt" which is a
measurement of the electrical power).
   LUMINAIRE: See definition of Fixture, Light Fixture (Also Called Luminaire).
   LUMINOUS FLUX: The power emitted from a source of electromagnetic radiation,
such as a light bulb or light transmitting elements, in the form of visible
light. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (flux) and is typically specified by
the manufacturer for a given lamp or fixture. Typical luminous flux values for
incandescent bulbs are one hundred (100) watts: one thousand five hundred fifty
(1,550) lumens; seventy five (75) watts: one thousand eighty (1,080) lumens;
sixty (60) watts: seven hundred eighty (780) lumens; and forty (40) watts: four
hundred fifty (450) lumens.
   MOTION SENSOR: A sensor which causes a luminaire to become illuminated
automatically upon the presence of motion or infrared radiation or a
combination thereof within its field of view.
   MOUNTING HEIGHT: The height above normal grade to the lowest light emitting
part of an installed fixture.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION: The construction of a new principal building on a "lot"
(as such terms are defined in section
5-2-1 of this title) or the expansion of an existing principal building on a
lot such that the resulting "floor area" (as defined in section
5-2-1 of this title) of such principal building is increased by more than fifty
percent (50%).

or purpose when said task or purpose is not being actively performed (e.g.,
parking lot illumination and wall mounted perimeter lights after business
hours).
   PHOTOMETRY: A technical test report that indicates light distribution and
performance of a fixture. A photometric plan may include candlepower
distribution data, cutoff classification, foot-candle chart, etc., some of
which are generally available directly from the manufacturer, and which may
have been produced by an independent laboratory.
   SEARCHLIGHT: Lighting installation, either ground or vehicle mounted,
designed to project a high intensity beam of light that is typically used to
sweep the sky for promotional purposes.
   SECURITY LIGHTING: Exterior lighting installed primarily for personal safety
or emergency purposes that is attached to a structure or used to illuminate a
walk or driveway and is fully shielded. Any lighting identified by the
Barrington Hills police department as serving a security function will also be
classified as security lighting.
   SHIELD OR SHIELDED: When applied to lighting, an opaque barrier which does
not allow light to be transmitted in certain directions.
   SKYGLOW: The brightening of the night sky or the overhead glow from
artificial light that is directed upward or reflected off moisture and dust
particles in the atmosphere, reducing the ability to view the natural night
sky.
   SPECIAL EVENT LIGHTING: Lighting approved by the village for use at a
temporary special event.
   SPORTS LIGHTING: Light fixtures used to illuminate courts, arenas, riding
arenas, fields, tracks and other recreational areas generally utilizing high
light output fixtures, higher light levels and are mounted on higher than
average freestanding poles.
   UL RATING: A reference to "Underwriters Laboratories" (or other recognized
testing laboratory), a commercial agency that certifies the maximum safe
wattage for fixtures and other electrical devices. A UL label indicating the
maximum safe wattage is affixed or imprinted on all light fixtures which are
offered for sale.
   UNIFORMITY RATIO: A ratio that describes uniformity of illuminance across an
area.
   UNSHIELDED: The luminaire only incorporates clear glass, which permits all
light to escape.

5-6-12: NONRESIDENTIAL LIGHTING STANDARDS:
Two (2) types of light sources or luminaries are available. One is a fixture
having no cutoff, directing the light to limit view of the light source or
luminaire. The second is a cutoff fixture, shielding the light source from
view.
All business district property shall meet the following lighting standards:
   (A)   Type Of Fixture: All fixtures shall be cutoff fixtures that prevent
the light source to be visible at the property line, except that decorative
pedestrian lighting may be permitted subject to subsection (B) of this section.
   (B)   No Cutoff Lights: The actual light source for no cutoff decorative
lighting shall be no more than 100 watt incandescent luminaire per fixture.
   (C)   Maximum Illumination Cutoff Luminaries: The maximum illumination from
cutoff luminaries at a property line with abutting residential shall be one-
tenth (0.1) foot-candle. On abutting nonresidential properties or public
streets the maximum illumination at the property line shall be two (2) foot-
candles. Where residential is across a street the maximum illumination at the
use's boundary shall not increase the ambient light on centerline of the
street. The maximum illumination at any one point shall not exceed forty (40)
foot-candles.
   (D)   Maximum Illumination No Cutoff Luminaries: The maximum illumination
from no cutoff luminaries at a distance ten feet (10') in from a property line
with abutting residential shall be one-tenth (0.1) foot-candle. On abutting
nonresidential properties or public streets the maximum illumination at the
property line shall be three (3) foot-candles. Where residential is across a
street the maximum illumination at the use's boundary shall be one foot-candle.
The maximum illumination at any one point shall not exceed fifteen (15) foot-
candles.
   (E)   Maximum Height: Any lighting fixture or luminaire that exceeds twenty
feet (20') in height or proposes more than 400 watts or more than three (3)
luminaries per pole shall be approved as a special use and reviewed for impact
on all surrounding uses.
   (F)   Floodlights: The use of floodlights or other lighting that is in
excess of these standards may be requested as a special use permit.
      1.   The lighting shall be necessary for safety or health requirements.
      2.   The applicant shall have to demonstrate that buffer yards are in
place that screen neighboring residential properties from glare reaching their
windows.
Shielded spots shall be screened by evergreen landscaping, walls, berms, or
cutoff shielding so the light source is not visible off site. In most cases, a
combination of cutoff shielding and a landscape or other feature will be needed
to provide the necessary screening.
   (G)   Hours: The lighting shall be extinguished between the hours of ten
o'clock (10:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. except that lighting may be
allowed to remain on for one-half (1/2) hour after the end of an event in the
building but not later than one minute past twelve o'clock (12:01) A.M.,
provided a permit has been issued in advance of such event by the zoning
enforcement officer. The enforcing officer may permit security lighting or
lighting for maintenance or other after hours employees, provided such lighting
shall be on separate circuits and the areas to remain lighted must be located
or screened in such a way to reduce impact substantially from the normal
lighting. (Ord. 04-01, 2-23-2004)
5-6-13: DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR BP DISTRICT:
No subdivision shall be approved under title 6 of this code nor shall any
building permit be issued until a development plan is approved as provided in
this section.
The owner or owners of any tract of land within the BP district shall submit to
the president and board of trustees a plan for the use and development of all
the tract of land. The proposed development plan shall first be submitted in
preliminary form. The preliminary development plan shall be referred to the
plan commission for study, public hearing, and report. The plan commission,
upon receipt of the preliminary development plan, shall set a day certain for a
public hearing thereon. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing
shall be published at least once, not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than

Upon approval by the plan commission of the preliminary development plan, after
a public hearing thereon, the applicant shall, within one hundred twenty (120)
days thereof, present to the plan commission a final development plan which
shall not vary materially from the approved preliminary plan, for final
approval by the plan commission.
The plan commission shall within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the final
plan make its report and recommendations to the president and board of trustees
with such additional conditions as are, in its opinion, necessary to fulfill
the objectives of this chapter; provided, however, that if the preliminary plan
had received the approval of the plan commission, the final plan shall be so
approved, with or without conditions, if the final plan is substantially the
same as the preliminary plan, and the planned uses shall be consistent with the
permitted and special uses (if a special use permit has been issued) in the BP
district.
In its consideration of the preliminary development plan, the plan commission
shall require evidence that:
   (A)   The plan complies with the requirements of this title, including,
section
5-6-14 of this chapter;
   (B)   The property in the general vicinity of the area included in the plan
will not be adversely affected;
   (C)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of the zoning
regulations of the village to promote public health, safety, and welfare;
   (D)   The planned use shall form a compatible, harmonious community group or
groups;
   (E)   The development plan provides for a uniform quality of buildings
pursuant to a village approved architectural covenant, requiring, at a minimum,
permitted materials and harmony between buildings; and

be utilized in the determination of the common land, if any be provided, shall,
upon the recommendation of the plan commission, be designated as such on the
plan and conservation area established by conveyance or easement to the village
or other not for profit entity approved by the village to ensure the continued
existence and maintenance of said area. (Ord. 04-01, 2-23-2004)
5-6-14: BP DISTRICT SITE DESIGN:
The following standards shall apply to all development plans submitted pursuant
to section
5-6-13 of this chapter:
   (A)   Parking Lot Landscaping: For every three (3) spaces there shall be at
least one canopy tree planted. The trees shall be planted in islands between
parking spaces, at the ends of aisles, or between aisles. The minimum width of
a planting island shall be five feet (5') of pervious material suitable as a
planting medium.
   (B)   Street Landscaping: For each one hundred feet (100') of street, four
(4) canopy trees shall be planted on each side of the street.
   (C)   Lot Landscaping: For each acre of land not covered by pervious
surfaces (roads, parking, buildings, or walks) there shall be six (6) canopy
trees, and six (6) understory or evergreen trees planted per a landscape plan
approved by the plan commission.
   (D)   Trees: All canopy trees shall be three inch (3") caliper. Understory
trees shall be two inch (2") caliper, and evergreens seven (7) to eight feet
(8') in height.
   (E)   Loading, Truck Access, And Waste Storage: Where loading and truck
access is in the yard between residential uses or vacant land that is zoned for
residential use or faces a public street, the area shall be enclosed. If the
wall or berm options are used, the plan commission may require additional
landscape planting to further screen the area.
   (F)   Accessory Waste Or Trash Storage: Where dumpsters or common waste
storage facilities are used they shall be located to be screened from view from
public roads or residential areas. The area where a dumpster and/or garbage
cans are stored shall be fully enclosed with a wood or masonry fence (or other
durable low maintenance materials approved by the plan commission) or berms.
The gates shall be kept closed. The area shall be landscaped, with hedges
planted to screen the wall and one canopy, understory, or evergreen tree per
fifty feet (50') of perimeter wall or berm.
   (G)   Building Materials: The following are approved building materials:
masonry (brick or stone), curtain walls (except reflective glass), and wood.
Metal sided buildings are prohibited. Concrete block (but not concrete brick or
concrete curtain wall) is prohibited. The prohibited materials may be permitted
only if the plan commission finds the buildings to have sufficient
architectural detailing so as to be of the same architectural quality and
character as buildings built with the permitted materials. Reflective glass is
prohibited to ensure that reflected rays from the sun do not create glare
visible in residential areas. Where a building is in a wooded area that screens
all residential uses, the plan commission may, upon consideration of such
effect, permit the use of reflective glass.
   (H)   Sign Package: All signage proposed for the development shall be
described in a sign package, including such detail as may be required by the
plan commission. (Ord. 04-01, 2-23-2004)

5-6-14-3: VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Where the plan commission finds that extra hardships or particular
difficulties may result from strict compliance with the development plan
regulations under this section or section
5-6-13 or
5-6-14 of this chapter, the plan commission may recommend variations or
exceptions to such regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured. Such variations or exceptions shall not, however, have
the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this title. The plan
commission shall not recommend variations or exceptions to the development plan
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented in
each specific case that:
      1.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable, generally, to other property;
      3.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase the economic return from the development of the property;
      4.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to public
health, safety or general welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;
      5.   The special circumstances or conditions have not resulted from any
act of the applicant subsequent to the effective date hereof, whether or not in
violation of any portion thereof;
      6.   The variation granted is the minimum adjustment necessary for the
reasonable use of the land; and
      7.   The aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variation;
there must be deprivation of beneficial use of land.
   (B)   The plan commission shall submit a report to the board of trustees
regarding the basis and justification for any variations recommended. (Ord. 04-
01, 2-23-2004)

or, if in discrete pulses, are more than one hundred (100) per minute. Impact
vibration, that is, discrete pulses which do not exceed one hundred (100)
impulses per minute shall not cause in excess of twice the displacements
stipulated.
5-7-7: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, SMOKE AND PARTICULATE MATTER:
   (A)   Use, Lot and Bulk Regulations (Performance Standards, Smoke and
Particulate Matter):
      1.   Any use established in the Light Industrial District after April 1,
1963 shall be so operated as to comply with the performance standards governing
smoke and particulate matter set forth hereinafter. No use lawfully established
on April 1, 1963 shall be so altered or modified as to conflict with, or
further conflict with, the performance standards governing smoke and
particulate matter established hereinafter. Any use lawfully established on
April 1, 1963 shall be permitted to be altered, enlarged, expanded or modified;
provided, that new sources of smoke and/or particulate matter conform to the
performance standards established hereinafter. The total emission weight of
particulate matter from all sources within the boundaries of the lot shall not
exceed the net amount permitted after such alteration, enlargement or
modification.
      2.   In addition to the performance standards specified hereinafter, the
emission of smoke or particulate matter in such manner or quantity as to be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort or welfare is
hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall henceforth be unlawful.
      3.   For the purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann
Chart, published and used by the United States Bureau of Mines, shall be
employed. The emission of smoke or particulate matter of a density greater than
No. 2 on the Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times, except as otherwise
provided hereinafter.
      4.   The emission, from all sources within any lot area, of particulate
matter containing more than ten percent (10%) by weight of particles having a
particle diameter larger than forty four (44) microns is prohibited.
      5.   Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such
sources as storage areas, yards, roads and so forth, within lot boundaries,
shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling or other
acceptable means. Emission of particulate matter from such sources in excess of
the weight limitations specified hereinafter is prohibited.
   (B)   Light Industrial District (Performance Standards, Smoke and
Particulate Matter):The emission of more than ten (10) smoke units per hour per
stack is prohibited, including smoke of a density in excess of Ringelmann No.
2. However, once during any six (6) hour period each stack may emit up to
twenty (20) smoke units, not to exceed Ringelmann No. 2, when blowing soot or
cleaning fires. Only during fire-cleaning periods, however, shall smoke of
Ringelmann No. 3 be permitted, and then for not more than four (4) minutes per
period.
The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of one pound per acre of
lot area during any one hour, after deducting from the gross hourly emission
per acre the correction factor set forth in the following table:
   Allowance for Height of Emission*
 
Height of Emission Correction
Above Grade (Feet) (Pounds Per Hour Per Acre)
50                 0.01
100                0.06
150                0.10
200                0.18
300                0.30
400                0.50
 
*Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within
the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
      1.   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source
of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area, thereby
obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre.
      2.   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in subsection 1
above, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of
emission set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission.
      3.   Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in
subsection 2 above, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources
of emission within the boundaries of the lot. Such total shall not exceed one
pound per acre of lot area during any one hour.

CHAPTER 8
PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION:
5-8-1: Purpose and Intent
5-8-2: Procedure
5-8-3: Preliminary Development Plan
5-8-4: Final Development Plan
5-8-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The planned development is intended to permit, in accordance with the master
plan, the development of areas containing not less than sixty (60) contiguous
acres under one ownership or control, whereby the location of all residential,
commercial, industrial and governmental uses, school sites, parks, playgrounds,
recreation areas, parking areas and other open spaces shall be controlled in
such a manner as to permit housing accommodations and land uses in orderly
relationship to one another. Such planned developments, when approved, shall
constitute a part of the master plan of the Village as a whole, and the
consideration of such planned developments by the Plan Commission shall be
based on recognition of this requirement.
Such planned developments are intended to conserve local areas of natural
beauty, to add to the sense of spaciousness, to achieve better design in
buildings and to help promote the public health, safety, morals and welfare of
the people residing therein and nearby, and to aid in stabilizing and improving
property values.
It is intended that this Chapter on Planned Developments superimposes the
requirements of this Zoning Title upon the underlying district without changing
the fundamental intent of the underlying district requirements as to the land
use and density of said use. There shall be no minimum lot size, no minimum lot
width and no minimum setback lines, except there shall be a building setback
line of one hundred feet (100') from the boundary lines of any such planned
development.
No planned development shall be permitted in R1 or R2 Districts.
5-8-2: PROCEDURE:
The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising an area of not less than
sixty (60) acres may submit to the President and Board of Trustees a plan for
the use and development of all the tract of land. The proposed development plan
shall first be submitted in preliminary form. The preliminary development plan
shall be referred to the Plan Commission for study, public hearing and report.
The Plan Commission, upon receipt of the preliminary development plan, shall
set a day certain for a public hearing thereon. Notice of the time and place of
such public hearing shall be published at least once, not less than fifteen
(15) days nor more than thirty (30) days before the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village.
Upon preliminary approval by the Plan Commission of the preliminary development
plan, after a public hearing thereon, the applicant shall, within one hundred
twenty (120) days thereof, present to the Plan Commission a final development
plan which shall not vary materially from the preliminary plan, for final
approval by the Plan Commission.
The Plan Commission shall, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the
final plan, make its report and recommendations to the President and Board of
Trustees with such additional conditions as are, in its opinion, necessary to
fulfill the objectives of this Chapter; provided, however, that if the
preliminary plan has received the approval of the Plan Commission, the final
plan shall be so approved if the final plan is substantially the same as the
preliminary plan, and the planned use shall be consistent with the underlying
zoning district.
In its consideration of the preliminary development plan, the Plan Commission
shall require evidence that:
   (A)   The property in the general area of the area included in the plan will
not be adversely affected;
   (B)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of the zoning
regulations of the Village to promote the public health, safety and welfare;
   (C)   The planned use shall form a compatible, harmonious community group or
groups;
   (D)   Any open space, tree cover, recreational area, scenic vista or other
authorized land use whose acreage shall be utilized in the determination of the
common land, if any be provided, shall, upon the recommendation of the Plan
Commission, be conveyed in fee simple title by the owner to a not-for-profit,
Illinois corporation with an agreement and restrictive covenants to insure the
continued existence and maintenance of said area.
5-8-3: PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
The preliminary development plan shall consist of:
   (A)   An overall development plat showing the use or uses, dimensions and
locations of proposed structures, parking space, if any, location of streets,
location of parks, open space, tree cover and all other common land, if any.
   (B)   Topographic survey.
   (C)   Proposed covenants and agreements insuring the continued existence and
maintenance of all common lands and the development of the site in accordance
with the plan.
   (D)   Engineering reports showing types and locations of wells, sanitary
systems and water drainage, within the development, including the effects on
wells, sanitary systems and water drainage in surrounding areas within the
Village.
   (E)   Such other pertinent information as may be necessary to a
determination that the contemplated arrangement for uses makes it desirable to
apply regulations and requirements different from those ordinarily applicable
under the zoning regulations of the Village.
5-8-4: FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
The final development plan shall consist of:
   (A)   A final plat which shall conform to the subdivision regulations of the
Village 1 , and in addition thereto shall show the location of all buildings
and structures to be erected in the planned development and a statement of the
restrictions, covenants and agreements running with the land.
   (B)   Topographic survey.
   (C)   Covenants, agreements and restrictions insuring the continued
existence and maintenance of all common lands and the development of the site
in accordance with the plan, executed in triplicate by the owner or owners and
mortgagee, if any; provided, however, the mortgagee may, in lieu of executing
said documents, present a good and sufficient subordination agreement.
   (D)   Final engineering reports showing types and locations of wells,
sanitary systems and water drainage within the development, including the
effects on wells, sanitary systems and water drainage in surrounding areas
within the Village.
   (E)   Such other documents as may be required by the Plan Commission which
would be consistent with the purpose of this Chapter.
The corporate authorities shall, within seventy (70) days after the receipt of
the recommendations of the Plan Commission, either adopt the recommendations of
the Plan Commission and approve the planned development, or reject the
recommendations of the Plan Commission and disapprove the planned development.

God to the extent that the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was
before the occurrence shall exceed fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the
restoration of the entire building new, shall not be restored, except as
required by law, unless said building or structure and the use thereof shall
conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is located.
In the event such damage or destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of the
cost of restoration of the entire building new, no repairs or reconstruction
shall be made unless such restoration is started within one year from date of
the partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
      2.   Building or Structure Designed or Intended for a Permitted Use: A
building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or

the regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event such
damage or destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
restoration of the entire building new, no repairs or reconstruction shall be
made unless such restoration is started within one year from date of the

regulations of the district in which it is located.
      2.   In Building or Structure Designed or Intended for a Permitted Use:
If a nonconforming use of a building or structure, all or substantially all of
which building or structure is designed or intended for a use permitted in the
district in which it is located, is discontinued for a period of six (6)
consecutive months, it shall not be renewed and any subsequent use of the
building or structure shall conform to the use regulations of the district in

Use: The nonconforming use of a building or structure, all or substantially all
of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in
which it is located may not be changed to another nonconforming use, but may be

5-10-2: ZONING CERTIFICATES:
Except as hereinafter provided, no permit pertaining to the use of land or
buildings shall be issued by any officer, department or employee of the village
unless the application for such permit has been examined by the enforcing
officer and has affixed to it a certificate of the enforcing officer indicating
that the proposed building or structure complies with all of the provisions of
this title. Any permit or certificate of compliance issued in conflict with the
provisions of this title shall be null and void.
Every application for a building permit shall be accompanied by:
   (A)   A plat in triplicate of the piece or parcel of land, lot, lots, block
or blocks, or parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale showing the actual
dimensions and certified by a land surveyor or civil engineer licensed by the
state of Illinois as a true copy of the piece or parcel, lot, lots, block or

such land; and
   (B)   A statement showing the name of the owner and applicant, the legal
description of the property, a statement and description of the uses to be

enforcing officer for the proper enforcement of this title.
One copy of each of the two (2) plats shall be attached to the application for
a building permit when it is submitted to the enforcing officer for a zoning
certificate and shall be retained by him as a public record.
The enforcing officer shall issue a written permit or a denial thereof with
reasons in writing, within fifteen (15) days from the date of the acceptance of
the application. In the event the permit or denial thereof is not issued within
fifteen (15) days, the applicant may appeal directly to the zoning board of
appeals, which shall order the issuance of the permit or the denial thereof
with reasons in writing.
Except where an extension has been obtained in writing from the enforcing
officer, permits heretofore and hereafter issued shall expire within ninety
(90) days if a substantial beginning has not been made in the construction or
establishment of the use applied for and within one year, if not completed. All
fees shall be as established by resolution of the board of trustees. (Ord. 63-
1, 4-1-1963)
5-10-3: COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES:
No building, or addition thereto, constructed after the effective date hereof,
and no addition to a previously existing building shall be occupied, and no
land vacant on the effective date hereof shall be used for any purpose, until a
certificate of compliance has been issued by the enforcing officer. No change
in a use other than that of a permitted use shall be made until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the enforcing officer. Every certificate of
compliance shall state that the use or occupancy complies with all the
provisions of this title.
   (A)   Application For Compliance Certificate: Every application for a
building permit shall be deemed to be an application for a compliance
certificate. Every application for a compliance certificate for a new use of
land where no building permit is required shall be made directly to the
enforcing officer.
   (B)   Issuance Of Compliance Certificate: No compliance certificate for a
building or addition thereto constructed after the effective date hereof shall
be issued until construction has been completed and the premises inspected and
certified by the enforcing officer to be in conformity with the plans and
specifications upon which the building permit was based. No compliance
certificate for a building or addition thereto, constructed after the effective
date hereof shall be issued and no addition to a previously existing building
shall be occupied until the premises has been inspected and certified by the
enforcing officer to be in compliance with all the applicable performance
standards of the zoning district in which it is located and all violations of
this code have been resolved and all fines and penalties assessed against the
owner or the property under any of the provisions of this code have been paid
in full. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary certificate
may be issued, to be valid for a period not to exceed six (6) months from its
date during the completion of any addition or during partial occupancy of the
premises.
A compliance certificate shall be issued, or written notice shall be given to
the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued, not later
than fourteen (14) days after the enforcing officer is notified in writing that
the building or premises is ready for occupancy.
   (C)   Penalty: Any person who occupies or uses a building or structure
without the issuance of a certificate of compliance shall be liable for a fine
of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). Each day such violation
continues shall be deemed a separate offense. (Ord. 13-09, 6-24-2013)
5-10-4: VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Purpose: The zoning board of appeals, after a public hearing, may
determine and vary the regulations of this title in harmony with their general
purpose and intent, only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth, where
the board makes findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter
prescribed, and further finds that there are practical difficulties or
particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this title, relating to the use, construction or alteration of
buildings or structures or the use of each portion of land.
   (B)   Application For Variation And Notice Of Hearing: An application for a
variation shall be made by the owner of the subject property, or if by another
person having an interest therein, with the written concurrence of the owner of
the subject property. An application for a variation shall be filed in writing
with the enforcing officer. The application shall contain such information as
the zoning board of appeals may from time to time, by rule, require. Notice of
the time and place of such public hearing shall be published at least once, not
less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the village. The published notice may be supplemented by such
additional form of notice as the board, by rule, may require.
   (C)   Standards For Variations: The zoning board of appeals shall not vary
the regulations of this title, as authorized in subsection (A) of this section,
unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
      1.   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the district for which it is zoned; and
      2.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
      3.   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality.
The zoning board of appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon
the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the
standards established in this subsection (C) to reduce or minimize the effect
of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to better carry
out the general intent of this title. If the petitioner is in violation of any
provision of this code or is subject to any fines or penalties imposed under
any provision of this code, the zoning board of appeals may condition the
granting of any variation upon the petitioner first correcting or curing any
such violation or paying any such fines or penalties.
   (D)   Authorized Variations: Variations from the regulations of this title
shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the
standards established in subsection (C) of this section, and may be granted
only in the following instances and in no others:
      1.   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback required
by the applicable regulations.
      2.   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots but in no
event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than
ninety percent (90%) of the required area and width.
      3.   To permit the same off street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses provided the substantial use of
such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week.
      4.   To reduce the applicable off street parking or loading facilities
required by not more than one parking space or loading space or twenty percent
(20%) of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater.
      5.   To increase by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use
served.
      6.   To vary the regulations as set forth in the Sign Regulations,
Chapter 5-11, by no more than twenty percent (20%) for any of the following:
gross area of any sign; height above grade at the location of the sign; and/or
setback.
      7.   To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum gross
floor area of any use so limited by the applicable regulations.
      8.   To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this
subsection, when a lot of record or a zoning lot, vacant or legally used on
April 1, 1963, is, by reason of the exercise of the right of eminent domain by
an authorized governmental body or by reason of a conveyance under threat of an
eminent domain proceeding, reduced in size so that the remainder of said lot of
record or zoning lot or structure on said lot does not conform with one or more
of the regulations of the district in which said lot of record or zoning lot or
structure is located.
      9.   To permit increases in the height of fences and walls permitted as
obstructions in required yards.
      10.   To permit the location of a satellite antenna, private, on a lot or
lots where it would otherwise be prohibited solely because of insufficient
screening, but in no event shall the requirement for screening be waived along
the front yard line.
The concurring vote of five (5) members of the zoning board of appeals shall be
necessary to grant a variation. No order of the zoning board of appeals
granting a variation shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months
from the date of such order unless a building permit is obtained within such
period and the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is
commenced within such period. The zoning board of appeals may, upon application
made within said six (6) months, for good cause, extend said time an additional
six (6) months; provided, that said time limit shall not apply and there shall
be no fixed time limit in cases where the variation granted is a variation as
to the area or width of a lot or lots granted under subsection (D)2 of this
section, if a plat containing the lot or lots in question, utilizing the said
area or width variation as granted, and conforming to law, including the
Barrington Hills subdivision ordinance (if applicable), shall be recorded in
the office of the recorder of deeds or (if applicable) registered in the office
of the registrar of titles, within two (2) years of the date of the order of
the zoning board of appeals granting said variation. (Ord. 13-09, 6-24-2013;
amd. Ord. 20-07, 3-24-2020)
5-10-5: APPEALS:
   (A)   Scope Of Appeal: An appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals
by any person aggrieved by a decision of the enforcing officer made pursuant to
this title or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the village in
respect of this title. Such appeal shall be taken within forty five (45) days
of the action complained of, by filing with the enforcing officer a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The enforcing officer shall forthwith
transmit to the zoning board of appeals all of the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. (Ord. 89-18, 12-18-1989)
   (B)   Findings On Appeals: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the enforcing officer certifies
to the zoning board of appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed with
him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the zoning board of appeals or by a court of record on application
on notice to the enforcing officer and on due cause shown.
The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the
appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a written
decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay. The board may affirm or may,
upon the concurring vote of five (5) members, reverse, wholly or in part, or
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, as in its opinion

   (B)   Initiation of Amendment: Amendments may be proposed by a Trustee, the

   (F)   Findings of Fact and Recommendations of the Zoning Board of Appeals:
Within a reasonable time after the close of the hearing on a proposed
amendment, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make written findings of fact and
shall submit same together with its recommendation to the Board of Trustees of
the Village. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to
change the zoning classification of particular property, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case with respect to the following matters:
      1.   Existing uses of property within the general area of the property in
question.
      2.   The zoning classification of property within the general area of the
property in question.
      3.   The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted
under the existing zoning classification.
      4.   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which may have taken place
since the day the property in question was placed in its present zoning
classification.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed
amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the
public interest and is not solely for the interest of the applicant. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may recommend the adoption of an amendment changing the zoning
classification of the property in question to any higher classification than
that requested by the applicant. For the purpose of this paragraph the R1
District shall be considered the highest classification and the Light
Industrial District shall be considered the lowest classification.
   (G)   Action by the Board of Trustees:
      1.   The Board of Trustees of the Village shall not act upon a proposed
amendment to this Title until it shall have received a written report and
recommendation from the Zoning Board of Appeals on the proposed amendment.
      2.   In cases where the Zoning Board of Appeals recommends that a
proposed amendment not be adopted or in case of written protest against any
proposed amendment signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) of the property proposed to be altered or by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) of the property adjacent to the property proposed to be altered, and
filed with the Clerk of the Village, such amendment shall not be passed except
by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members of the Board of
Trustees.
      3.   If an application for a proposed amendment is not acted upon finally
by the Board of Trustees of the Village within sixty (60) days of the time of
receipt of the Zoning Board of Appeals' recommendations, it shall be deemed to
have been denied.
   (H)   Minimum Size of Parcel: A lot, lots or parcel of land shall not
qualify for a zoning amendment unless it possesses a minimum of one hundred
fifty feet (150') of frontage and contains a minimum of forty thousand (40,000)
square feet of area, or adjoins a lot, lots or parcel of land which bears the
same zoning district classification as the proposed zoning amendment.
5-10-7: SPECIAL USES:
   (A)   Purpose: The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based
upon the division of the Village into districts, within which districts the use
of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot
be properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public or private need for the particular use at the particular
location. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. (Ord. 63-1, 4-1-63)
   (B)   Initiation of Special Use: An application for a special use may be
made by the owner of the subject property, or by another person having an
interest therein with the written concurrence of the owner thereof, to use said
property for one or more of the special uses provided for in this Zoning Title
in the zoning district in which the land is situated. (Ord. 72-3, 3-27-72)
   (C)   Application for Special Use: An application for a special use shall be
filed in writing with the Enforcing Officer. The application shall contain such
information as the Zoning Board of Appeals may from time to time, by rule,
require. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be published
at least once, not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days
before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village. The
published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the
Board, by rule, may require. (Ord. 77-17, 9-26-77)
   (D)   Authorization: For each application for a special use the Zoning Board
of Appeals shall report to the Board of Trustees of the Village its findings
and recommendations, including the stipulations of additional conditions and
guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest.
The Board of Trustees may grant or deny any application for a special use;
provided, however, that in the event of written protest against any proposed
special use, signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of
the property adjacent to the property proposed for a special use, and filed
with the Village Clerk, such special use shall not be granted except by the
favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all the members of the Board of Trustees.
   (E)   Standards: No special use shall be recommended by the Zoning Board of
Appeals unless said Board shall find:
      1.   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
      2.   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
      3.   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      4.   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
      5.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets
and roads.
      6.   That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the board of trustees pursuant
to the recommendation of the zoning board of appeals.
   (F)   Conditions And Guaranties: Prior to the granting of any special use,
the zoning board of appeals may recommend, and the board of trustees shall
stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed necessary
for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the
standards and requirements specified in subsection (E) of this section. In all
cases in which special uses are granted, the board of trustees shall require
such evidence and guaranties as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied
with.
   (G)   Effect Of Denial Of A Special Use: No application for a special use
which has been denied wholly or in part by the board of trustees shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial,
except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to
be valid by the zoning board of appeals and the board of trustees. (Ord. 63-1,
4-1-1963)
   (H)   Revocation: In any case where a special use has not been established
within six (6) months after the date of granting thereof, then without further
action by the zoning board of appeals or the board of trustees, the special use
authorization shall be null and void. The zoning board of appeals may, upon
application filed within said six (6) months, and for good cause, extend said
time an additional six (6) months. (Ord. 77-17, 9-26-1977)
   (I)   Special Uses On Historical Sites: An applicant may request as a unique
historical use any permitted and/or special use allowed in any zoning district
to be allowed in any other zoning district, subject to compliance with the
following conditions:
      1.   Proof that the subject property or the improvements thereon are of
historic value or significance and that preservation of the same will be
enhanced, maintained or assisted by permitting the unique use as proposed.
      2.   Proof that permitting the unique use will be of some affirmative
benefit, from a land use or preservation standpoint, to the subject property,
the surrounding properties and neighborhood, and the village.
      3.   The application shall have the burden of presenting clear and
convincing proof that the unique use is justified and proper. (Ord. 79-5, 2-26-
1979)
5-10-8: FEES:
Any application for an amendment, appeal, special use or variation shall be
accompanied by a fee. The fee shall be established by resolution of the board
of trustees. All fees shall be paid to the village clerk. There shall be no
such fee, however, in the case of applications filed in the public interest by
members of the zoning board of appeals, board of trustees or the enforcing
officer. (Ord. 06-11, 6-26-2006)
5-10-9: PENALTIES:
Any person or agents, employees or contractors of such person, who shall
violate, disobey, omit, neglect or refuse to comply with, or who shall resist
enforcement of any provisions of the zoning regulations of the village shall be
subject to the penalty provisions under section
1-4-1 of this code. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense. (Ord. 63-1, 4-1-1963; amd. 1977 Code)

conditions and restrictions upon the territory to be disconnected as it may
deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the
Village residents, including, but not limited to, the requirement of
recordation of restrictive covenants regarding future use, density of
development, required yards and conservation easements.

general area of the territory proposed for disconnection;
      5.   The trend of development outside of the Village in the general area
of the territory proposed for disconnection;
      6.   The need for the anticipated use in Barrington Hills;
      7.   The extent to which property values in the Village may be diminished
by the disconnection and anticipated future use of the territory;
      8.   The extent to which such diminution of property values promotes the
public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the residents of the
Village;
      9.   The relative gain to the residents of Barrington Hills as compared
to any hardship to the property owner(s); and
      10.   Such other matters as may be deemed relevant to a particular
application.
The ZBA shall not recommend the granting of a petition for disconnection unless
it finds that such disconnection and anticipated future use of the territory is
in the public interest and is not solely for the interest of the petitioner.
The ZBA may recommend the imposition of such conditions and restrictions upon
the territory to be disconnected as it may deem necessary to protect the public
health, safety, morals and welfare of the Village residents, including, but not
limited to, the requirement of recordation of restrictive covenants regarding
future use, density of development, required yards, and conservation easements.
   (K)   Action by the Board of Trustees:
      1.   The Board of Trustees shall not act upon a petition for
disconnection until it shall have received a written report and recommendation
from each of the Plan Commission and the Zoning Board of Appeals on the
proposed disconnection.

Appeals recommends denial of a petition for disconnection, or in case of a
written protest against a proposed disconnection signed and acknowledged by the
owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the property adjacent to the
territory proposed to be disconnected is filed with the Village Clerk, such
petition shall not be granted except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3)
of all members of the Board of Trustees.
      3.   In granting a petition for disconnection, the Board of Trustees may
impose such conditions and restrictions upon the territory to be disconnected
as it may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, morals and
welfare of its residents, including, but not limited to, the requirement of
recordation of restrictive covenants regarding future use, density of
development, required yards and conservation easements.
      4.   Action by the Board of Trustees on a petition for disconnection
shall be by resolution. Such resolution, by its terms, shall not take effect
until and unless all review fees incurred by the Village have been reimbursed
by the petitioner and all conditions to approval (such as recording of
restrictive covenants) have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Village
Attorney or Special Counsel.
   (L)   Appeal to Circuit Court: Actions against the Village pertaining to the
validity of this Section or any part thereof, or any application thereof, shall
be brought in Cook County, as the county in which the Village's principal

6-3-4: INCREASED FACILITIES:
Where storm sewers, sanitary sewers or water facilities are made larger than is
immediately required to serve the land described in the final plat, due to the
necessity of serving adjacent and/or presently vacant property as it shall be
developed in the future by others, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for such
additional cost on the following terms and conditions:
   (A)   The Village Engineer shall determine the cost of such storm sewer,
sanitary sewer and/or water facilities as are required to serve only the
immediate needs of the property described in the plat. The Village Engineer
will also determine the cost of such facilities actually required to serve the
plat in question and the adjacent land when developed. The cost determined in
this Section shall be the cost at the time of installation.
   (B)   The difference in cost in the above determinations shall be paid to
the original developer by the developers of adjacent properties. At the time
the adjacent properties are submitted for subdivision, the Village Engineer
shall apportion the benefit received by the adjacent property developer by
reason of the increased facilities. The adjacent property developer shall pay
the sum of money equal to his proportionate share of the cost of the increased
facilities.
   (C)   The Village may, as determined by the Board of Trustees, act as the
collecting agent in regard to increased facility sharing. In such cases, an
administrative handling charge of five percent (5%) shall be applied to the
adjacent developer's share and retained by the Village. Upon receipt of such
proportionate share payment by the adjacent property developer, the Village
shall reimburse the developer who originally installed the increased
facilities. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-93)
6-3-5: VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Where the Plan Commission finds that extra hardships or particular
difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, the Plan
Commission may recommend variations or exceptions to the regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Such
variations or exceptions shall not, however, have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this Title. The Plan Commission shall not recommend
variations or exceptions to the regulations of this Title unless it shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented in each specific case that:
      1.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable, generally, to other property;
      3.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property;
      4.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to public
health, safety or general welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;
      5.   The special circumstances or conditions have not resulted from any
act of the applicant subsequent to the effective date hereof, whether or not in
violation of any portion thereof;
      6.   The variation granted is the minimum adjustment necessary for the
reasonable use of the land; and
      7.   The aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of any
reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variation;
there must be deprivation of beneficial use of land.
   (B)   The plan commission shall submit a report to the board of trustees
regarding the basis and justification for any variations recommended.
   (C)   In accordance with the provisions and standards of this section, the
board of health shall recommend and the board of trustees shall grant, grant
subject to conditions, or deny requests for variations from strict compliance
with the provisions of section
4-2-7 of this code, "the private sewage disposal code"; provided, however, that
no variance shall be granted to subsection
4-2-7(D)3 of this code. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-1993)
6-3-6: VACATION OF PLATS AND PUBLIC STREETS:
   (A)   In cases where an application is made to the board of trustees to
vacate any subdivision, or part thereof, prior to the sale of any lot in the
subdivision, the board of trustees may, by ordinance, order the vacation of all
or part of the said subdivision. When lots have been sold, the plat may be
vacated, providing all the owners in said plat join in the execution of said
application.
   (B)   In cases where an application is made to the board of trustees to
vacate any street, alley or public place, or part thereof, within the
jurisdiction of said board of trustees, the board of trustees may in such cases
order the street, alley or public place, or part thereof, vacated and received
from the owner or owners of property abutting on such street, alley or public
place or part thereof so vacated, compensation in an amount which, in the
judgment of such board of trustees shall be equal to the benefits which will
accrue to the owner or owners of such abutting property by reason of such
vacation to the extent owned by the village, provided that such order of
vacation shall be passed by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3)
of the members of the board of trustees.
   (C)   In all cases where application for vacation of any subdivision or any
public street, or part thereof, is made to said board of trustees, such
application shall be referred to the village engineer, who shall make an
investigation of the premises described in such application. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-
1993)
6-3-7: RESUBDIVISIONS:
A resubdivision, following all procedures otherwise required herein for
approval of a subdivision, shall be required for any proposed change to a
previously recorded plat of subdivision or portion thereof (other than a
vacation of a previously recorded plat of subdivision or public street),
including, but not limited to, changes in lot lines, building lines, drainage
easements, conservation easements and utilities easements. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-
1993)
6-3-8: ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC USE:
Where a proposed public park, playground, school site or other public use area,
as determined by the plan commission and the board of trustees, is located on
the "official map" in whole or in part within a subdivision, the subdivider
shall set aside such lands for such public purposes to be purchased or
condemnation proceedings commenced by the appropriate public agency within a
period not to exceed one year from the date of approval of the final plan.
(Ord. 93-5, 5-24-1993)
6-3-9: EQUESTRIAN TRAILS:
When the plan commission determines, in consultation with the equestrian
commission, that an equestrian trail(s) exists on property proposed for
subdivision, an easement for equestrian trails shall be provided along the
perimeter of the entire subdivision area or at such other locations on the
property as may be recommended by the plan commission to the village board.
Where there is no existing equestrian trail(s) on property proposed for
subdivision, the equestrian commission shall determine whether or not any
equestrian trail(s) should be created and shall make its recommendation on such
to the plan commission and the plan commission may require an easement for
equestrian trails be provided along the perimeter of the entire subdivision or
at such other locations as may be recommended by the plan commission to the
village board. The designs and specifications for such recommended equestrian
trail(s) will be determined by the plan commission in consultation with the
equestrian commission and village engineer based on the anticipated area and
subdivision site conditions. The dedication of easements for equestrian trails
shall require the approval of the village board upon recommendation by the plan
commission. The requirement of the dedication of easements for equestrian
trails as herein provided may be satisfied, at the recommendation of the plan
commission and approval by the village board, by easements granted to such
private, not for profit entities that operate and maintain equestrian trails
within the village, as may be approved by the village board. Should any
easements for an equestrian trail(s) be provided on the final plat, the
following certification shall appear on the final plat:
   A [BLANK] wide easement for an equestrian trail is hereby reserved for and
granted to the Village of Barrington Hills for use by the public. No buildings,
structures or obstacles shall be placed, constructed or maintained on, across,
over or through said easement, nor shall trees, shrubs, bushes or other
vegetation be planted or removed without the written authority of the Village
of Barrington Hills. Use of the equestrian trail is limited to equestrian
activities, and no vehicles of any kind shall be permitted to use the easement
except for maintenance.

6-4-3: STREETS:
   (A)   General Criteria And Standards: The current edition of "Transportation
And Land Development" by the Institute of Transportation Engineers is hereby
incorporated into this section and made part hereof by this reference in order
to provide direction as to the criteria which should enter into the selection
of the design standards for all improvements.
      1.   All improvements required by this section shall be constructed in
accordance with the standards herein and in accordance with the latest edition
of the following Illinois department of transportation specifications:
         a.   "Standard Specifications For Road And Bridge Construction".
         b.   "Standard Specifications For Traffic Control Items".
         c.   "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices For Streets And
Highways".
         d.   "Highway Standards".
      2.   Convenient access to all property within the subdivision shall be
afforded by either a dedicated public street or a private street or private
access connecting with a public or private street. Public streets will usually
be required in all subdivisions over ten (10) lots in size. Private streets may
be considered by the plan commission depending on site suitability, provided
that a binding agreement contained in the plat or other recorded or registered
document shall assure the continued existence and maintenance of said street or
access.
      3.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to the Barrington Hills Road Network Map and shall be
considered by the Plan Commission in relation to: existing and planned streets;
reasonable circulation of traffic within the development; topography; storm
water drainage; public convenience and safety; and their appropriate
relationship to uses in the area to be served.
         a.   The type of street cross-section selected for each improvement
required by this Section shall depend on the site conditions identified in the
preliminary analysis and inventory prepared by the applicant and shall conform
to Village approved design standards on file with the Village Clerk. A
residential street cross-section may be used to limit the extent of disturbance
on forested areas or where continuous ditches would be subject to erosion.
Either a residential or rural street cross-section may be used in areas that
can accommodate such improvements. Intermingling the two (2) types of street
cross-sections in a start-and-stop fashion is prohibited.
         b.   A residential street cross-section shall consist of a paved
surface with a curb and gutter section and a four foot (4') shoulder along each
side. The shoulder shall slope toward the curb in cut sections and away from
the curb in fill sections. Storm sewers shall be utilized to provide drainage.
         c.   A rural street cross-section shall consist of a paved surface
with two foot (2') shoulders and a drainage ditch along each side.
         d.   All curb and gutter systems required by this Section shall be
constructed in accordance with the residential street cross- section, rural
street cross-section and combination curb and gutter cross-section standards
adopted by the Board of Trustees and on file with the Village Clerk.
      4.   Minor streets shall be so aligned that their use by through traffic
shall be discouraged.
      5.   Where, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, it is desirable to
provide for street access to adjoining property, the proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property.
      6.   Where deemed necessary for the purpose of providing adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic, the Plan Commission may recommend access streets be required to
service areas fronting on major streets.
      7.   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment or continuation of
existing streets already named shall bear the name of such existing streets
whether in the Village or in unincorporated areas. In no case shall the names
for proposed streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use
of a suffix (such as street, road, boulevard, drive, place or court, etc.) or
an abbreviation thereof. Street names shall be approved by the Plan Commission
which shall keep a list of all street names in the Village.
      8.   No permanent building or structure or permanent improvement of any
type shall be erected within the extension of street rights of way indicated on
the Official Map of the Village.
   (B)   Right of Way:
      1.   The minimum width of right of way of any classification of street
shall be as follows:

Minor                  50 or 66'
Min. cul-de-sac radius 50', 60' or 70'
 
      2.   When any subdivision or part of a subdivision is adjacent to only
one side of an existing right of way, which is less than the required width,
the subdivider shall dedicate additional right of way to meet the requirement
in accordance with this regulation. Half-streets in new subdivisions are not
permitted.
   (C)   Block Standards:
      1.   Block lengths and widths shall be coordinated with the development
of the land and shall be provided in a manner that will allow proper traffic
flow including fire fighting equipment and pedestrian use; and pedestrian
accessways within the blocks to schools, parks or other destinations may be
required by the Plan Commission.
      2.   A subdivision containing interior open space, parks, playgrounds or
school sites, will be acceptable when such plans include adequate rights of way
for pedestrian access to the interior open space. Such developments shall
provide acceptable agreements as to development and maintenance of these areas.
   (D)   Public Street Design Standards:
      1.   Street Grades: The grades of collector streets shall not exceed six

Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways" and the "Standard
Specifications for Traffic Control Items".
   (J)   Special Soil Regulations for Streets:
      1.   Organic Soils: If the construction of proposed streets or roads in a
subdivision is through organic soils, all organic materials shall be removed to
solid subsoil in the area of the proposed street or road and replaced with fill
materials that allow movement of ground water in its natural state through the
fill and provide the required structural support for the roadway. All such
streets shall be elevated above the expected high water in the area, as
determined by the Soils Map, so as to provide a minimum of two feet (2')
between the pavement surface and the water. In no instance shall the pavement
base course be constructed within six inches (6") of the expected high water,
as determined by the Soils Map.
      2.   Wet Soils: If the construction of proposed streets and roads in a
subdivision are to go through wet soils, positive ground water control must be
achieved. The surface of all roads shall be constructed at an elevation so as
to provide a minimum of two feet (2') between the pavement surface and expected
high ground water or free water surface. In no instance shall the pavement base
course be constructed within six inches (6") of expected high water, as
determined by the Soils Map. All designs shall insure that natural drainage is
maintained. In no instance shall movement of ground water be impeded so as to
promote build-up of hydrostatic pressure on one side or the other of a proposed
roadway. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-93)
6-4-4: STORM WATER MANAGEMENT:
Storm water management for all subdivisions shall comply with the following
standards. Special attention shall be given to avoiding changes in storm water
runoff onto adjacent properties. Final storm water management design shall not
increase the runoff or peak discharge or decrease the time of concentration of
storm water leaving the development.
   (A)   Runoff Calculations:
      1.   For areas, including all tributary areas, less than twenty- five
(25) acres or less in size, the Rational Method may be used to calculate
discharges but may not be used for determining detention storage requirements.
      2.   For areas, including all tributary areas, over twenty-five (25)
acres in size and for areas less than twenty-five (25) acres but which require
the determination of detention storage requirements, the TR-55 Method shall be
used for determining discharges and detention storage requirements.
      3.   The determination of design rainfall shall use the "Frequency
Distribution and Hydroclimatic Characteristics of Heavy Rainstorms in
Illinois," Bulletin 70, 1989, prepared by the Illinois State Water Survey.
      4.   Runoff calculations for tributary areas shall be based on
anticipated future land use conditions or existing land use conditions,
whichever yields the greater runoff. Anticipated future land use of undeveloped
areas shall be based on development of the area using the current zoning.
      5.   All existing or natural detention basins will be maintained within a
development and their area specifically preserved for that use. The volume of
detention storage required for the development shall be in addition to the
existing storage.
   (B)   Release Rates and Discharges:
      1.   The release rates for the developed site shall be the lesser of the
following:
         a.   Ninety percent (90%) of the storm water runoff for the site in
its existing condition for storms of all durations;
         b.   The downstream storm water transport rate; or
         c.   The proportionate share for the site of the available downstream
storm water transport rate based on the total tributary area.
      2.   All storm water discharges leaving a site must be conveyed into a
well-defined receiving channel with adequate downstream capacity.
      3.   All areas of the development must be provided an emergency overflow
path that will pass the 100-year flow without damage to structures or property.
   (C)   Detention Basins:
      1.   All detention basins shall be provided with an emergency overflow
structure capable of passing the 100-year inflow rate without damage to
structures or property.
      2.   All detention basins shall be developed to fit the site and provide
a natural appearance. Restoration of the detention basin shall include the
planting of trees and bushes and be in accordance with Section
6-4-9 of this Chapter.
      3.   Single pipe outlets shall have a minimum inside diameter of ten
(10") inches. If design release rates require smaller outlets, structures such
as perforated risers or flow control orifices shall be used.
   (D)   Ditches: Ditches shall be constructed on both sides of the roadway
outside of the shoulder line. Ditches shall have a minimum depth of two feet
(2') below the edge of the roadway surface with maximum side slopes of four to
one (4:1) on the roadway side and two to one (2:1) on the property side.
Maximum ditch gradient without erosion protection shall be two percent (2%). If
a ditch gradient exceeds two percent (2%), the ditch shall be protected from
erosion by means of sodding, ditch checks, storm sewers or combinations
thereof, as deemed necessary by the Village Engineer. Other creative means of
erosion control will be considered on an individual basis. Minimum ditch
gradient shall be three-tenths of one percent (0.3%). If this gradient cannot
be maintained, storm sewers shall be installed.
   (E)   Driveway Culverts: Prior to acceptance of the street improvement or
the issuance of any building permits, the applicant shall submit to the Village
an overall map of the subdivision showing the proper size culvert for each lot,
as determined from hydraulic calculations.
   (F)   Storm Sewers and Culverts:
      1.   Storm sewers shall be installed to drain all roads with curbs and
gutters and on slopes where continuous ditches would be subject to erosion. The
minimum internal diameter of a storm sewer shall be ten inches (10"). All storm
sewers shall be concrete.
      2.   Minimum culvert sizes shall be twelve inches (12") for driveways and
fifteen inches (15") for roadway crossings. At roadway crossings, a minimum
depth of six inches (6") shall be maintained between the top of the pipe and
the finished roadway subgrade.
      3.   All storm sewers and roadway culverts shall be fitted with end
sections or headwalls and shall extend a sufficient distance beyond the
shoulder line to fit the ditch side slope.
      4.   Special consideration shall be given to the end treatment of storm
sewers and culverts thirty-six inches (36") in diameter or larger to assure
compatibility with the surrounding environment.
      5.   Storm sewers, culverts and related structures shall be designed in
accordance with current standards of the Illinois Department of Transportation
for such drainage structures using the following design storms:
         a.   For developments of twenty-five (25) acres or less, including all
tributary areas, a ten (10) year storm frequency shall be used.
         b.   For developments of more than twenty-five (25) acres but less
than one hundred (100) acres, including all tributary areas, a twenty-five (25)
year storm frequency shall be used.
         c.   For developments of one hundred (100) acres or more, including
all tributary areas, a fifty (50) year storm frequency shall be used.
   (G)   Positive Drainage: All streets shall be designed so as to provide
positive drainage that will alleviate any flooding in excess of six inches (6")
over the street crown.
   (H)   Drainage Calculations: The applicant's engineer shall provide the
Village Engineer with copies of all calculations required to design the storm
drainage system for the proposed subdivision. The computations shall include
data for the entire area tributary to the development. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-93)
6-4-5: PUBLIC UTILITIES:
   (A)   All telephone, cable television, electric and gas service lines shall
be placed underground throughout the entire subdivision area. All conduits or
cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner
which will not conflict with other underground service. All such telephone,
electric and gas service lines shall be located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. Above ground structures identified with said
underground service facilities shall be located so as not to be unsightly or
hazardous to the public and shall be landscaped.
   (B)   Where no alleys are provided, there shall be dedicated appropriate
utility easements of not less than ten feet (10') in width, where necessary to
provide a proper continuity for such utilities from lot to lot and from block
to block. No structures shall be constructed upon the easements. Additional
easements shall be provided for utilities, drainage and other public services
and requirements in order to provide proper operation and maintenance of said
facilities. (Ord. 93-5, 5-24-93)
6-4-6: PRIVATE SEWAGE TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:
   (A)   Private Sewage Treatment And Disposal Systems:
      1.   General: The village board may, when it deems necessary for the
health, comfort, safety and general welfare of the present or future population
of the area and necessary to the conservation of water supplies and drainage
sources, prohibit the subdivision of land requiring the use of septic tank and
effluent disposal systems for the disposal of sanitary wastes. If a septic tank
system is permitted, every lot in a subdivision shall have a suitable area of
sufficient size to accommodate a septic system equivalent to two (2) times the
disposal requirements of a five (5) bedroom home, as provided in section
4-2-7-1, appendix G, exhibits A and B of this code.
      2.   Soil Investigation: A minimum of one observation pit at each
intersection of a two hundred foot (200') grid is required with intermediate
observations at critical soil boundaries so as to allow intensive mapping of
soil characteristics applicable to the design of private sewage disposal
systems. At least one observation point shall be located on each proposed lot.
      3.   Groundwater Table: The anticipated groundwater and seasonal high
water table as interpreted from soil classifications shall be indicated for all
lots within the subdivision. Special engineering solutions will be required on
those lots where a seepage field does not clear the groundwater level by four
feet (4') and the limiting layer by two feet (2') when normal cut and cover
construction methods are used.
      4.   Unsuitable Lots: Those lots which contain soil types with very
severe limitations as to their use for the installation of subsurface seepage
fields as described in chapter 7, exhibits A, B, C, and D of this title will be
considered unsuitable for installation of said systems. An engineering solution
for upgrading each lot to a usable level shall be submitted to the village for
approval and record. Engineering solutions shall not violate any laws or
ordinances relative to natural drainage or floodplains and must meet the
requirements of section
4-2-7 of this code.
If a proposed lot cannot be upgraded sufficiently for installation of
subsurface disposal system, the lot shall be dropped from the plat and the area
distributed among adjacent suitable lots.
All lots containing unsuitable soils or water problems for installation of
subsurface seepage fields shall be recorded on the final plat of subdivision as
such.
   (B)   Special Soil Regulations For Private Sewage Treatment And Disposal
Systems:
      1.   Wet Soils:
         a.   The installation of subsurface sewage waste disposal systems in

approval or acceptance of the improvements by the Board of Trustees of the
Village.
      4.   Insufficient Fund Balance: If, at any time before the construction
of all required improvements has been completed, the balance of funds remaining
undisbursed under said escrow account or letter of credit is not sufficient, in
the sole judgment of the Village Engineer, to cover the cost of construction of
said improvements and all engineering costs including the engineering and
inspection fees of the Village or if by reason of any order, decree or writ of
any court, or for any other reason, the said undisbursed balance of funds shall
be withheld, diminished or otherwise unavailable for the purposes provided
herein, the owner agrees to cause the balance to be increased to such amount as
shall be required by the Village for such purposes, in the exercise of its
judgment, or shall provide such other guarantee of performance as may be
required by the Village.
   (C)   Performance Guarantee for Subdivisions Outside the Village Limits:
Option 1, 2 or 3 above will not be required by the Village for a subdivision or

10-1-1: DRIVEWAYS, DEFINITIONS AND PURPOSE:
Driveways are privately owned roads which connect residences, buildings,
parking lots and other areas with public roads and highways. Although driveways
are essential to provide access to these facilities,, they can produce
hazardous roadway conditions. Engineering studies show that as residential and
commercial development expands along public roadways, accident rates increase.
The purpose is to review the design and frequency of driveways in order to
minimize the incidence of accidents and thereby maintain a reasonable and safe
traffic flow along the Village roadways. (Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996)
10-1-2: PERMIT REQUIRED:

   (D)   The construction of any access driveway or the revision of any
existing driveway within the right of way along a Village roadway, if such
driveway can not meet the general design criteria described herein.
   (E)   Temporary Driveways. Temporary driveways will only be issued if deemed
necessary by the Village Engineer. Temporary driveways may be approved as part
of a building permit, a separate temporary driveway permit would not be
required. (Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996; amd. Ord. 21-20, 12-16-2021)
10-1-2-1: PERMIT GENERAL CONDITIONS:
The permit will be issued by the Village Engineer. All construction work
performed is subject to any imposed conditions of the permit with accompanying
approved plans, drawings, sketches or other attachments. A guide called "Policy
on Permits for Access Driveways to State Highways" has been published by the
Illinois Department of Transportation. The design standards from this
publication are discussed in the following sections of this Chapter. The
provisions of this publication should be used along with other engineering
considerations to guide the owners (applicants) and the Village in its review
of permit applications. (Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996)
10-1-2-2: OBTAINING PERMITS, FEES, PENALTY:
   (A)   Each application for permit required under the provisions of this

A sketch or plan of the proposed driveway(s) shall be submitted showing the
location of the driveway and adjacent uses including other driveways within
five hundred feet (500').
   (B)   Upon receipt of the plan, the Village Engineer will review the
proposal and either issue a permit or explain reasons for denial of a permit.
   (C)   A fee in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) will be required
upon submission of the application for permit.
   (D)   If a property owner does not first obtain a driveway permit under the
provisions of this Chapter, as specified, he shall be denied use of the
illegally installed access and such access may be closed by the Village. (Ord.
96-4, 4-22-1996; amd. Ord. 21-20, 12-16-2021)
10-1-3: DESIGN CRITERIA:
Driveways accessing major arterials require more stringent requirements than
those accessing collector or local roads. Standards for all driveways, however,
should minimize potential accidents and conflicts between through vehicles and
those entering and leaving the driveway. The objectives to be achieved through
the use of proper driveway spacing criteria include, but are not limited to:
   (A)   Minimize the speed differential between through vehicles and those
using the driveway.
   (B)   Eliminate encroachment of turning vehicles on adjacent lanes.
   (C)   Prohibit motorists from using driveways as a cut through to avoid
roadway construction.
   (D)   Provide sufficient space between driveways to reduce interference from
traffic using adjacent driveways.
   (E)   Discourage motorists from parking on roads or backing out onto the
highway or road.
   (F)   Preserve the original intent of the roadway, pedestrian walkway and
drainage facilities.
   (G)   Provide adequate sight distance of oncoming traffic for motorists
exiting the driveway. (Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996)
10-1-4: DESIGN STANDARDS, RESIDENTIAL:
The following minimum design standards shall be required:
   (A)   Width Of Drive: All permitted residential, noncommercial or
noninstitutional driveways should have a width between ten feet (10') and
twenty-four feet (24') with appropriate flares at the curb or pavement edge.
   (B)   Flare Radii: The recommended radii for residential driveways is five
feet (5') at minimum and fifteen feet (15') maximum.
   (C)   Angle Of Driveway: The driveway centerline should generally be at a
right angle (90°) to the pavement edge and follow this angle from the roadway
to the right of way line, or to a minimum distance of forty feet (40') from the
edge of the pavement.
   (D)   Drainage: Each driveway approach shall be installed to such a slope or
height and such slope or height shall be thereafter maintained, so as not to
interfere with the drainage from the crown of the public road or the shoulder
of the roadbed toward the nearest downstream ditch or storm drain opening, as
may be necessary to accommodate the flow of surface water now existing along
such road at its present grade. Each driveway so designed shall include the
prevention of any erosion(s) or transfer of sediment or material from the
owner's property onto the village roadway(s). (Ord. 04-16, 12-20-2004; amd.
Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996; Ord. 21-20, 12-16-2021)
10-1-5: DESIGN STANDARDS, INSTITUTIONAL AND COMMERCIAL:
The following minimum design standards shall be required:
   (A)   Width Of Driveway: All commercial and institutional driveways are
limited to a maximum width of thirty-five feet (35') measured at right angles
(90°) to the centerline of the driveway, exclusive of flares. The maximum
opening along the pavement should be no more than forty feet (40'), measured
six feet (6') back from the pavement edge.
   (B)   Flare Radii: The radii should be between ten feet (10') and twenty
five feet (25').
   (C)   Angle Of Driveway: Generally, the driveway should be at a right angle
(90°) to the roadway. The angle can be reduced to sixty degrees (60°) for two-
way driveways or forty five degrees (45°) for multiple (one-way) entrances.
(Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996; amd. Ord. 21-20, 12-16-2021)
10-1-6: DESIGN STANDARDS, GRADES:
Driveways should have a grade that slopes away from the roadway surface at a
rate equal to the slope of the shoulder but not less than three-sixteenths inch
(3/16") nor greater than one inch (1") per foot. The slope should continue for
a distance equal to the shoulder width. Beyond the shoulder the driveway grade
should not exceed ten percent (10%). (Ord. 96-4, 4-22-1996)
10-1-7: DESIGN STANDARDS, SPACING:
Unless conditions indicate otherwise, only one driveway will be permitted for
each residential, commercial, or institutional property. Pursuant to the design
criteria of this chapter, commercial property may be allowed a maximum of two
(2) driveways. A minimum distance of four hundred forty feet (440'), and
preferably six hundred sixty feet (660'), shall be required between the
centerlines of commercial entrances and similar developments that generate high
traffic volumes. However, service driveways into these centers, which are not
used by the general public, may be closer than four hundred forty feet (440')
as long as they do not encroach on turning lanes. The minimum distance of four
hundred forty feet (440') is also desirable between major commercial entrances
and the nearest public roadway. For residential driveways requiring a permit,
the minimum distance between the driveways and the nearest public roadway
should be fifty feet (50').
If two (2) or more property owners have a legal agreement describing their
joint right to property access, they may be allowed access from the same
location as long as all other provisions of this title are followed. (Ord. 96-
4, 4-22-1996)
