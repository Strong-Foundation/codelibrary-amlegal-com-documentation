hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings

frame otherwise indicated.

percent (8%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.

the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 2001-1,
1-9-2001)
1-10-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure

1-10-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 2001-1, 1-9-2001)

The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns

the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 2001-1, 1-9-2001)
1-10-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 2001-1, 1-9-2001)
1-10-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 2001-1, 1-9-2001)
1-10-17: LIENS:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
2001-1, 1-9-2001)
1-10-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling. (Ord. 2001-1, 1-9-2001)
1-10-19: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, paragraph or provision of this chapter shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of
such section, paragraph or provision shall not affect any of the remaining
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2001-1, 1-9-2001)

on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials
used, labor or service of the costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case
credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid.
"Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each
channel termination point within a municipality that has imposed a tax under
this chapter and charges for the portion of the interoffice channels provided
within that municipality. Charges for that portion of the interoffice channel
connecting two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is
located within the jurisdictional boundary of such municipality, shall be
determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge
for the interoffice channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional
boundary of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number
of channel termination points connected by the interoffice channel. However,
"gross charge" shall not include any of the following:
   (A)   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this chapter, 2) the tax imposed by the
telecommunications excise tax act, 3) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the
internal revenue code, 4) 911 surcharges, or 5) charges added to customers'

in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under

between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service;

sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under

be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);
   (H)   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication
devices;
   (I)   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act; or
   (J)   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate or
terminate outside this state.
INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.

corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or
permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this chapter, "private line" means
a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 2005-2, 3-8-2005)

against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent
of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax.

constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the

   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2005-2, 3-8-2005)

chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be

application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2005-

unincorporated Champaign County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village of St. Joseph, or that may be annexed into the
Village of St. Joseph, shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in
the flood insurance study of Champaign County prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated October 2, 2013. (Ord. 2013-08, 9-24-2013; amd.
Ord. 2017-3, 3-28-2017)
4-2A-4: DUTIES OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR:
The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the general administration of
this chapter and ensure that all development activities within the floodplains
under the jurisdiction of the Village of St. Joseph meet the requirements of
this chapter. Specifically, the Zoning Administrator shall:
   (A)   Process development permits in accordance with section
4-2A-5 of this chapter;
   (B)   Ensure that all development in a floodway (or a floodplain with no
delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of section
4-2A-6 of this chapter;
   (C)   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to section
4-2A-7 of this chapter are met and maintain a record of the “as built”
elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   (D)   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
section
4-2A-8 of this chapter;
   (E)   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public
health standards of section
4-2A-9 of this chapter;
   (F)   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of section
4-2A-11 of this chapter are met and maintain documentation of any variances
granted;
   (G)   Inspect all development projects and take any and all penalty actions
outlined in section
4-2A-13 of this chapter as necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
   (H)   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, State, and Federal permits;
   (I)   Notify IDNR/OWR and any neighboring communities prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse;
   (J)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
   (K)   Cooperate with State and Federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
   (L)   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps,
copies of State and Federal permits, and documentation of compliance for
development activities subject to this chapter;
   (M)   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   (N)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 2013-08, 9-24-2013; amd. Ord. 2017-3, 3-
28-2017)
4-2A-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator
shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet
the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      4.   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section
4-2A-7 of this chapter; and
      5.   Cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed engineer
or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Zoning
Administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that is shown by survey elevation to
be below the current base flood elevation is subject to the provisions of this
chapter. In addition, any development located on land shown to be below the
base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but not
identified as floodplain on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to
the provisions of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and
which has not been filled after the date of the site’s first flood insurance
rate map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
The Zoning Administrator shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site’s first flood insurance rate map
identification.
The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant
copies of all other Federal, State, and local permits, approvals or permit not
required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The Zoning
Administrator shall not issue a permit unless all other Federal, State, and
local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 2013-08, 9-24-2013; amd. Ord. 2017-3,
3-28-2017)
4-2A-6: PREVENTING INCREASED FLOOD HEIGHTS AND RESULTING DAMAGES:

and exit of floodwaters. Designs must either be certified by a licensed
professional engineer or by having a minimum of one permanent opening on each
wall no more than one foot (1') above grade with a minimum of two (2) openings.
The openings shall provide a total net area of not less than one square inch
for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base
flood elevation.
         (d)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored,
designed, and certified so as to minimize exposure to hydrodynamic forces such
as current, waves, ice, and floating debris.
         (e)   All structural components below the flood protection elevation
shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage.
         (f)   Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines,
submersible pumps, and other service facilities may be located below the flood
protection elevation provided they are waterproofed.
         (g)   The area below the flood protection elevation shall be used
solely for parking or building access and not later modified or occupied as
habitable space, or
         (h)   In lieu of the above criteria, the design methods to comply with
these requirements may be certified by a licensed professional engineer or
architect.
      3.   The building may be constructed with a crawl space located below the
flood protection elevation provided that the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
         (b)   Any enclosed area below the flood protection elevation shall
have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. A minimum of one opening on each wall having a
total net area of not less than one square inch per one square foot of enclosed
area. The openings shall be no more than one foot (1') above grade.
         (c)   The interior grade of the crawl space below the flood protection
elevation must not be more than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent
exterior grade.
         (d)   The interior height of the crawl space measured from the
interior grade of the crawl to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed
four feet (4') at any point.
         (e)   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable
period of time after a flood event.
         (f)   Portions of the building below the flood protection elevation
must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, and
         (g)   Utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above
the flood protection elevation.
   (C)   Nonresidential buildings may be structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu
of elevation) provided a licensed professional engineer or architect certifies
that:
      1.   Below the flood protection elevation the structure and attendant
utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the
base flood.
      2.   The building design accounts for flood velocities, duration, rate of
rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and the
impact from debris and ice.
      3.   Floodproofing measures will be incorporated into the building design

3-28-2017)
4-2A-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for a variance. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
applicant’s request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may attach such conditions to granting
of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   Conditions: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   Notification: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall notify an
applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building
protection standards of section
4-2A-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic Structures:
      1.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
4-2A-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or “historic structure” as defined
herein, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
sections
4-2A-6 and
4-2A-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         (a)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         (b)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building’s
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and
wet floodproofed:
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section
4-2A-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
4-2A-7 of this chapter. All of the building’s structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
4-2A-7 of this chapter.
      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection
4-2A-7(B) this chapter.
      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
4-2A-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      8.   Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 2013-08, 9-24-2013; amd. Ord. 2017-3, 3-28-2017)
4-2A-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the Village of St. Joseph or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 2013-08, 9-24-2013; amd. Ord. 2017-3,
3-28-2017)
4-2A-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Village President may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Village President shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days’ notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The Village of St. Joseph shall make application to the Circuit
Court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such
other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this

be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The Village of St. Joseph shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   (B)   The Village President shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The Village President is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension
of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate
the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to
resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village of St. Joseph from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.
2013-08, 9-24-2013; amd. Ord. 2017-3, 3-28-2017)

the date such notice is sent. The village president may, for purposes of this
section, appoint a village official, employee or committee member to act in his
place.
   (B)   Appeal: The person who owns or controls any property, after being
notified by the village president that a violation exists on his/her property,
may appeal that determination in the manner set forth herein. Appeal of such
determination shall be taken by filing a written appeal not more than fifteen
(15) days following the date of mailing of the notice of the violation provided
for in subsection (A) of this section. The appeal shall be addressed to the
board of trustees, through the office of the village clerk. The board of
trustees shall schedule a hearing date for not less than ten (10) days and not
more than thirty (30) days after receiving such notice of appeal, and shall
notify the person appealing of the date and time of their consideration of the
appeal and such person may appear and be heard by the board of trustees.

      1.   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid or gas.
      2.   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a
hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance or create any hazard in
the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant.
      3.   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment
and personnel of the sewage works.
      4.   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operation of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes,
cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar,
plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole
or ground by garbage grinders.
   (D)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters or wastes, if it appears likely in the
opinion of the inspector that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage
treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream,
or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming his/her opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes,
the inspector will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, maximum limits established by regulatory agencies, and other
pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
      1.   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred
fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) (65°C).
      2.   Any water or waste containing toxic or poisonous materials; or fats,
wax, grease, oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred
milligrams per liter (100 mg/l) or containing substances which may solidify or
become viscous at temperatures between thirty two degrees (32°) and one hundred
fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) (0° and 65°C).
      3.   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths (3/
4) horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and

      4.   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes, or
concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.
      5.   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and
similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive
chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the inspector for such materials.
      6.   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the inspector as necessary, after treatment of the composite
sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other public
agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
      7.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentrations as may exceed limits established by the inspector in compliance
with applicable state or federal regulations.
      8.   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
      9.   Any mercury or any of its compounds in excess of 0.0005 mg/l as Hg
at any time except as permitted by the inspector in compliance with applicable
state and federal regulations.
      10.   Any cyanide in excess of 1.2 mg/l at any time except as permitted

not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues), or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate).
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
         (c)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
         (d)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein.
   (E)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
   (F)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the judgment of
the inspector may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the inspector may:
      1.   Reject the wastes;
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      4.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of
subsection (L) of this section.
If the inspector permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the inspector and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
   (G)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or
other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the inspector and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (H)   Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his/her/its expense.
   (I)   When required by the inspector, the owner of any property serviced by
a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the inspector.
The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his/her/its expense, and shall
be maintained by him/her/it so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (J)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type, and frequency of
laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the
village, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete
analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that
compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are being met. The
owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the
village at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the village. The
owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting
required by the village. At such times as deemed necessary the village reserves
the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside
laboratory service.
   (K)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The Examination Of
Water And Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls, whereas
pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.
   (L)   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor by
the industrial concern. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)
7-1-6: DAMAGE TO SEWAGE WORKS:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, wilfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the municipal sewage works. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-
2006)
7-1-7: RIGHT OF ENTRY:
   (A)   The inspector and other duly authorized employees of the village, the
Illinois environmental protection agency, and U.S. environmental protection
agency, bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, and testing in accordance with provisions of this chapter. The
inspector or his/her representatives shall have no authority to inquire into
any processes including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper,
or other industries beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste
treatment.
   (B)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in subsection (A) of this section, the inspector or duly authorized employees
of the village, the Illinois environmental protection agency, and the U.S.
environmental protection agency shall observe all safety rules applicable to
the premises established by the company.
   (C)   The inspector and other duly authorized employees of the village
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all
private properties through which the village holds a duly negotiated easement
for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurements,
sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying
within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement,
shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)
7-1-8: VIOLATION:
   (A)   Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter, except
section
7-1-6 of this chapter, shall be served by the village with written notice
stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for
the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of
time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations. The village may
revoke any permit for sewage disposal as a result of any violation of any
provision of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the village for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the
village by reason of such violation. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)

There is hereby established an executive department of the Village to be known
and designated as the Sewerage Department of the Village, and there shall be
placed in charge of the general management and control thereof a
Superintendent, who shall be appointed by the President and the Village Board
of Trustees, it being hereby determined and declared that the establishment of
said department and the appointment of a Superintendent thereof is necessary
and expedient for the best interests of the Village. Said Superintendent shall
qualify for office in the same manner as any elective official of the Village
and shall post such bond in such amount as may be determined by the President.
All necessary employees of said department shall likewise be appointed by the
President with the approval of the Village Board of Trustees. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-
8-2006)
7-2-2: RATES, CHARGES:
There shall be and there are hereby established rates and charges for the use
of and for the services supplied by the sewerage system of the Village as
follows:
   (A)   Sewer Charges (Per 1 Month Billing Cycle): As used herein, one unit of
use is one hundred (100) cubic feet (750 gallons) of water used. The unit
charge is based on domestic strength concentration of two hundred milligrams
per liter (200 mg/L) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), two hundred fifty
milligrams per liter (250 mg/L) total suspended solids (TSS), twenty three
milligrams per liter (23 mg/L) ammonia (NH3-N), and four milligrams per liter
(4 mg/L) total phosphorous (TP).
      1.   Residential:
         (a)   Inside Village limits:
With metered water:
$15.00 minimum rate for up to 2 units used which shall be increased annually as
follows:
2020 $17.50
2021 20.00
2022 20.40
2023 20.80

2030 18.00
2031 18.90
2032 19.90
2033 20.90
 
Without metered water:
Flat charge of $54.00 per month for billing years 2019 through 2025 and $75.00
per month for billing years 2026 through 2033.
   (b) Outside Village limits:
With metered water:
Minimum rate for up to 2 units used shall be 150 percent of the metered water
rates inside of Village limits.
Rate per unit (or part thereof) for all additional water used shall be 150
percent of the metered water rates inside Village limits.
Without metered water:
Flat charge of $200.00 per month
      2.   Surcharge For Industrial And Other Nondomestic Strength Usage: All
rates for industrial and other nondomestic strength users will be established
by the Superintendent based on concentration and quantity of sewage. The bill
for flow will be the same as for domestic users. Nondomestic users with
wastewater discharged to the sewer system at concentrations greater than
domestic concentrations, as described above, in addition to charges for flow
will have additional surcharges based on strength (mass load). The user shall
be required to provide analysis and sampling as determined necessary by the
Superintendent in order to establish the concentration and amount of discharge
into the Village sewer system.
A surcharge for nondomestic strength discharge shall be charged on the
following basis:
 
BOD      $0.40 per pound
   TSS0.75 per pound
   NH30.80 per pound
   TP 7.50 per pound
 
      3.   Water Meters: Water usage shall be based upon meter readings
provided to the Village by the current water utility company. Users may receive
adjustments to their user charge bills for metered water not entering the
Village's sewer collection system by installing appropriate sewer or water
meters or negotiation with the Board of Trustees for a straight percentage
credit. Responsibility for initiating negotiations and studies for such a
credit rests entirely with the user.
      4.   Users Without Meters: All users not having a water meter or other
acceptable device for determining usage shall be subject to a fixed base user
charge in an amount determined by the Village. The Village shall consider
charges imposed on users having similar water use and wastewater
characteristics in determining said base user charge. The Village, at its
direction and discretion, may require a user receiving all or part of its water
from a private well or other source not metered by the current water utility
company or other public or private supplier of potable water to install at the
user's expense an appropriate metering device for the purpose of determining
usage.
   (B)   Multiple Occupancy: Provided further, in addition to the minimum and
flat charges stated above, an additional monthly charge of thirty dollars
($30.00) shall be made for each apartment, flat, place of business or family
unit exceeding one, in all buildings with only one meter, but containing two
(2) or more apartments, flats, places of business or family units, provided
that no additional charge shall be made for any vacant apartment, flat or place
of business which is vacant during an entire two (2) month period.
   (C)   Application For Service: No sewer connection shall be made to any
premises until an application therefor in writing has been made for that
purpose and filed with the Sewer Superintendent of the Village, stating the
purpose for which the services are to be used.
   (D)   Connection Fee: There is hereby established a sewer service connection
fee of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for residential users and
six hundred seven dollars ($607.00) per PE (population equivalent) for
commercial and industrial (nondomestic) users.
For a proposed connection that will generate one thousand five hundred (1,500)
gallons per day or more of wastewater, a connection permit from the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) must be issued before the Village of St.
Joseph can issue a connection permit.
The fee for any connection that requires an IEPA connection permit shall be the
calculated population equivalence stated in the IEPA permit application times
the connection fee per PE.
For nonresidential buildings, the connection fee shall be the highest of the
calculated population equivalence for design average flow (based upon 100
gallons of sewage per day), five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand (based upon
0.17 pounds per day) or suspended solids (based upon 0.20 pounds per day),
times the connection fee per PE. The minimum connection fee for nonresidential
buildings shall be based upon 2.5 PE.
The sewer connection fee shall be due prior to connection, and in the case of
new building construction, the fee shall be due and payable at the time the
application for building permit is filed, and said sewer connection must be
completed within twelve (12) months of payment of the fee or any additional
time approved for applicable building permit.
   (E)   Payment: All charges must be paid on or before the date due, to the
Village Clerk at the St. Joseph Municipal Building.
   (F)   Review Of Rates: Rates shall be reviewed annually by the Board of
Trustees and as otherwise deemed appropriate to determine if the rates will
provide sufficient funds to pay future costs of operation, maintenance and
replacement, and to determine that the rates charged users are in proportion to
the costs of the services provided. If the funds are not sufficient or the rate
does not maintain proportionality as determined by the review, revised rates to
accomplish the same shall be adopted by the Board of Trustees by ordinance and
published and thereafter be in effect. User charge rates so enacted by the
Village by ordinance shall remain in effect until modified or rescinded by a
subsequent duly passed ordinance.
The users of wastewater treatment services may be notified periodically, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation,
maintenance and replacement.
A Depreciation Fund shall be established and funds collected for replacement
shall be sufficient to replace sewerage system facilities and equipment
necessary to assure its continued efficient performance and to maintain the
capacity for which it was designed and constructed and unless otherwise
directed by the Board of Trustees, five percent (5%) of gross revenues shall go
into the Depreciation Fund. The Village shall maintain a depreciation
replacement schedule of all personal and real property, including residual
asset value, estimated remaining service life and the total annual replacement
costs. This schedule shall be evaluated as deemed appropriate. (Ord. 2019-1, 4-
9-2019)
7-2-3: LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT:
The owner of the premises and the occupant thereof and the user of sewerage
service, shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service on said
premises, and the service is furnished to the premises by the Village only upon
the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the service,
are jointly and severally liable therefor to the Village. Bills shall be
rendered to the user at the end of each two (2) month period and shall be
payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the original bill. For any
bills not paid by said due date, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount
of the charges for current services shall be added and become due. (Ord. 2006-
9, 8-8-2006)
7-2-4: APPEALS:
The method for computation of rates and service charges established for user
charges in section
7-2-2 of this chapter shall be made available to a user or owner within ten
(10) days of receipt of a written request for such. Any error in the method
used or in the computations thereof shall be remedied by the Village Clerk
within ten (10) days after notification of a formal written appeal outlining
the discrepancies. In the event the Clerk and the user or owner cannot resolve
the disagreement, the Board of Trustees shall review said matter and render its
determination at the next available Board meeting. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)
7-2-5: DELINQUENT PAYMENTS:
   (A)   Lien: In the event charges for sewerage service, including any penalty
then due, are not paid within thirty (30) days after the rendition of the bill
for such service, such charges and penalties shall be deemed and are hereby
declared to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquencies shall become and
constitute a lien upon the real estate for which such services are supplied.
Statements rendered for such user charge shall be deemed notice to the owner of
the property served and shall state that charges not paid within said thirty
(30) days may result in a lien being filed on said real estate pursuant to 65
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-141-7. The claim for lien shall be made in the
form of a sworn statement setting out: 1) a description of the real estate,
sufficient for the identification thereof, upon or for which the sewerage
service was supplied, 2) the amount or amounts of money due for such sewerage
service, and 3) the date or dates when such amount or amounts became
delinquent. In all cases where the user charge has become delinquent and the
Village elects to file a notice of lien therefor in the Office of the Recorder
there shall be added in addition to the amount due the Village such charges and
expenses as are necessary and required to verify the legal description of the
parcel to which the lien is to attach, plus a sum determined by the Board of
Trustees as sufficient to cover the cost of preparation of such notices and
forms required. In each instance, the Clerk of the Village shall be authorized
and directed to include such additional costs in the amount claimed due the
Village in the notice of lien. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)
   (B)   Enforcement: The Village shall be empowered to prosecute an action in
chancery to foreclose any lien filed pursuant to this chapter, or in the
alternative, resort to an appropriate action at law to collect unpaid user
charges, penalties charged under this chapter, interest thereon, as provided by
statute, and attorney fees incurred by the Village and court cost taxed by the
court, in each such action. The Village reserves the right to disconnect the
sanitary sewer serving the property for which the user charge bill has become
delinquent, or direct the water company to shut off the supply of water to said
premises, regardless of the action taken by the Village to collect said
delinquent bill, until the delinquent bill has been paid to the Village's
satisfaction. (Ord. 2011-11, 11-8-2011)
7-2-6: DISCONTINUE SEWER/WATER SERVICE:
   (A)   Disconnection: Anything in this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding, the board of trustees shall have the right to revoke sanitary
sewer connection permits and/or direct the water company to shut off the supply
of water to designated premises in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. Such disconnection and/or shutoff may be accomplished prior to or
subsequent to the filing of the lien set forth above. Said lien may be filed
before or after disconnection of sewer service, revocation of connection permit
or shutoff of water supply. The clerk may order sewer service to be
disconnected or water supply shut off to any user in accordance with the
following procedures:
      1.   Bills not paid within thirty (30) days of billing date shall result
in a late payment penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the charges for
current services and a notice of delinquency will be sent by first class mail.
      2.   If not paid within thirty (30) days, then a second notice of
delinquency will be sent to the user and owner by first class mail and
certified mail advising of disconnection of sewer service and/or shutoff of
water supply unless past due amount and penalty is paid, or unless user or
owner requests a hearing within twenty (20) days of the date of second notice
of delinquency, or unless an extended payment agreement is entered into between
the village and the user or owner.
      3.   If past due amount plus penalty is not paid and no hearing is
requested within twenty (20) days of notice of violation, and no extended
payment agreement is agreed upon, then a notice of disconnection and/or water
supply shutoff may be sent, at any time thereafter, by first class mail to the
user and owner advising of the date after which disconnection and/or shutoff
will occur unless payment is received. Said notice shall also be hung on the
front door of the building located on said property.
      4.   In the event a hearing is requested, the user and owner shall be
notified of the hearing date by first class mail no less than ten (10) days
prior to the date of the hearing before the board of trustees.
      5.   At the hearing, the user and/or owner may present evidence disputing
the charges or the record of payments. The trustees shall make findings as to
the amount owed by the user and owner and shall set a date, no less than ten
(10) days after the hearing, by which said amount must be paid unless an
extended payment agreement is approved by the board of trustees.
      6.   If said amount is not paid by the required date, sewer service may
be disconnected or water shut off at any time thereafter without further
notice, or in the event an extended payment agreement was approved by the board
and payment is not received by the village in accordance with said agreement,
then a notice of sewer disconnection and/or water shutoff will be sent by first
class mail to the user and owner advising of the date after which disconnection
and/or shutoff will occur unless payment is received.
   (B)   Reconnection: All amounts charged under this chapter are due and shall
continue to be due hereunder, whether or not said sewer is disconnected and/or
water supply is shut off, and no sewer shall be reconnected or water supply
turned on until the village is paid in full all amounts due it including
charges owed by the village to the water company related to the water supply
shutoff, together with a one thousand five hundred dollar ($1,500.00) fee for
reconnecting the sewer (if the sewer was disconnected), and in addition, there
shall be paid to the village a deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first
sewer reconnection or turn on of water supply, and one hundred dollars
($100.00) for any subsequent reconnection or water supply turn on. (Ord. 2011-
11, 11-8-2011)
   (C)   Responsibility To Ascertain Charges: The nonreceipt by any parcel
owner of a bill or statement for user charges shall not be an excuse for
nonpayment or entitle the user to request an extension or deferment of the date
upon which payment is due or to avoid inclusion of penalties and interest. The
owner of the property against which a notice of lien has been recorded pursuant
to the terms of this chapter shall be deemed to have notice of the existence of
the charge and shall be responsible for ascertaining from the village all
amounts, if any, due as provided in this chapter and the payment thereof. (Ord.
2006-9, 8-8-2006)
7-2-7: CLERK TO RENDER BILLS:
It is hereby made the duty of the village clerk to render bills for sewerage
service and all other charges in connection therewith, and to collect all
monies due thereon, and it is hereby made the duty of all officials of the
village to enforce payment of all unpaid bills and penalties in the manner,
form, time and procedure under the laws of the state of Illinois thereunto
enabling. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)
7-2-8: FUNDS KEPT SEPARATE:
All revenues and monies derived from the operation of the sewerage system shall
be held by the village clerk separate and apart from the clerk's private funds
and separate and apart from all other funds of the village, and all of said
sums, without any deductions whatsoever, shall be delivered to the village
treasurer not more than ten (10) days after the receipt of the same, or at such
more frequent intervals as may from time to time be directed by the village
board of trustees. (Ord. 2006-9, 8-8-2006)
7-2-9: SEWERAGE FUND:

7-4-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this storm water management chapter is to help guide the
attempts of developers to control the transportation or movement of storm water
and reduce damage to property and protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
7-4-2: INTENT:
The intent of this storm water management chapter is to require temporary
storage of storm water runoff, to control the rate of release of storm water
runoff, provide for adequate drainage of development sites and surrounding
areas, and protect existing agricultural drainage systems. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-
1999)
7-4-3: SCOPE OF APPLICATION:
   (A)   Reviewing Authority: For the purpose of this chapter the reviewing
authority shall be the village planning commission with final approval by the
village board of trustees for storm water management plans submitted in
connection with a subdivision plat. After initial hearing, further modification
may be approved by the board of trustees only. If no subdivision is involved,
the reviewing authority shall be the board of trustees only. (2005 Code)
   (B)   Applicability: The requirements of this chapter shall apply to the
following:
      1.   All subdivisions which require the approval of the village board of
trustees. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
      2.   Any development of land within the village unless expressly exempted
herein. For purposes of this chapter, "development" shall mean building of any
structures or covering the ground with any material or adding, removing or
movement of soil which significantly changes the runoff pattern of surface
water.
   (C)   Exemptions:
      1.   This policy shall not apply to completed development or completed
construction which has occurred on sites located in subdivisions which were
developed and approved prior to November 9, 1999. (2005 Code)
      2.   Development of a single-family or duplex residential home and
accessory buildings on a lot of less than one-half (1/2) acre in an R-1 or R-
2 residential zoning district. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
7-4-4: DRAINAGE PLAN:
   (A)   A storm water drainage plan including a combination of storm water
storage and controlled release shall be required of all development of land
which is subject to the provisions of this chapter. Such storm water drainage
plan must be approved by the village board of trustees after review and
recommendation of the planning commission before development may begin.
   (B)   If it is determined by the board of trustees that said plan does not
meet the requirements of this chapter, or that the village storm water system
does not have adequate capacity to accept storm water from the development
site, then the development plan shall not be approved. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
7-4-5: DRAINAGE SYSTEM COMPONENTS:
   (A)   Minor: The minor drainage component of the drainage system shall
consist of storm sewers, street gutters, small open channels, and swales
designed to store and convey the runoff from the 10-year recurrence interval
precipitation event utilizing the Illinois state water bulletin for rainfall
depths. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999; amd. 2005 Code)
   (B)   Major: The major drainage components shall be designed to store and
convey storm water flows beyond the capacity of the minor drainage component.
Information depicting storm water flow paths (including cross sectional data),
velocities, rates, and elevations and maps of flooding shall be included in the
submittal. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
7-4-6: DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Design Methods:
      1.   Calculation Of Drainage Capacity: The rational method may be used to
size the components of the proposed storm sewer system.
      2.   Calculation Of Required Storage (Watershed Area Less Than Or Equal
To 2,000 Acres): The volume of required storm water storage shall be based on
the following criteria:
         (a)   First flush storm event (0.75 inch rainfall depth). The
detention pond shall be designed to detain the first flush storm event for a
period not less than twenty four (24) hours. The required storage volume for a
first flush storm event shall be calculated as follows:
   Vff = 2,722.5 * C * A
Where:
   C   =   Developed runoff coefficient
A   =   Developed area (in acres)
   Vff   =   First flush volume (in cubic feet)
A restriction shall be designed to limit the first flush storm discharge to a
rate such that the pond will completely discharge in the required time period.
         (b)   2-year storm event. The detention pond shall be designed to
discharge a maximum of 0.04 cfs/developed acre during the 2-year storm event. A
restriction shall be designed to limit the 2-year storm discharge rate. The 2-
year storm restrictor shall be placed at an elevation equal to the first flush
storage elevation.
         (c)   50-year storm event. The detention pond shall be designed to
discharge a maximum of 0.20 cfs/developed acre during the 50-year storm event.
A restriction shall be designed to limit the 50-year storm discharge rate. The
50-year storm restrictor shall be placed at an elevation equal to the 2-year
storage elevation.
      3.   Storm Water Routing Methodologies: The required storage volume and
detention pond routing calculations shall be prepared using a generally
accepted storm water routing analysis, such as HEC-1, HEC-HMS, TR-55, TR-20,
PondPak, or XP-SWMM. Alternate methods of analysis may be considered if their
technical validity and accuracy is demonstrated.
The 10-year high water level shall be calculated using the above methodology
and used to establish the downstream boundary condition for the hydraulic grade
line calculations.
The Huff 3rd quartile 24-hour duration rainfall distribution shall be used for
the 2-year and 50-year detention pond routing calculations.
      4.   Required Freeboard; Detention Pond: A minimum of one vertical foot
of freeboard shall be provided above the 50-year peak water surface elevation.
No building shall be constructed within the proposed storm sewer system with a
first floor elevation less than two (2) vertical feet above the 50-year peak
water surface elevation.
      5.   Off Site Runoff: If storm water runoff enters the proposed
development from another parcel, it shall be demonstrated how this runoff is to
be collected and conveyed. It will be the responsibility of the developer to
provide an adequate and safe flow path for off site runoff.
      6.   Outlet Certification: When a proposed detention pond outlets to an
existing pipe, stream, river, or other drainage facility with a history of
flooding problems, it shall be demonstrated that the water levels in the
receiving system will not adversely affect the hydraulic performance of the
proposed detention pond. If necessary, the proposed detention pond may need to
be raised to a higher elevation so as to avoid the impacts of downstream
hydraulic restrictions.
      7.   Emergency Overflow: An emergency overflow path shall be provided for
each storm water detention facility. This overflow structure shall be
constructed to function without special maintenance and shall not increase the
risk of erosion or endangering public safety. It shall be demonstrated that
discharge from the emergency overflow will have adequate conveyance downstream
of the development.
      8.   Calculation Of Required Storage (Watershed Area Greater Than 2,000
Acres): In the event of a large development (larger than 2,000 acres), the
total area shall be divided into manageable subwatersheds for the purpose of
establishing individual storm water management zones. Each subwatershed shall
be subject to the above storm water conveyance and detention pond sizing
requirements. The size and layout of proposed subwatersheds are subject to
village approval.
   (B)   Storm Water Storage Areas:
      1.   Wet Bottom Detention Pond: The use of wet bottom detention ponds is
recommended, as they help to minimize storm water pollution and provide
positive site amenities. The following requirements shall apply to the design
and construction of wet bottom detention basins:
         (a)   The water surface area of the permanent pool shall not exceed
one-fifth (1/5) of the area of the tributary watershed, or as approved by the
reviewing authority.
         (b)   Minimum normal water depth (excluding safety ledges and side
slopes) shall be eight feet (8') provided, however, that if fish are to be
maintained in the pond at least one-quarter (1/4) of the pond area shall be a
minimum of ten feet (10') deep.
         (c)   Measures shall be included in the design to minimize pond
stagnation and to help ensure adequate aerobic pond conditions.
         (d)   Storage facility side slopes shall provide a safety ledge below
the normal water elevation which shall not exceed a slope of six to one (6:1)
(6 horizontal units to 1 vertical unit) to a point at which the normal water
depth is no less than five feet (5'). Below a normal depth of five feet (5'),
side slopes shall not exceed the stable angle of repose under saturated
conditions of the soil material of the basin.
         (e)   Detention pond discharge pipes less than twelve inches (12") in
diameter shall not be allowed. Multiple discharge pipes from a storm water
storage area are discouraged.
         (f)   It shall be demonstrated that the detention pond discharge pipe
will adequately connect to a receiving system and that the receiving system has
adequate capacity to convey the 50-year peak discharge rate of 0.20 cfs per
developed acre.
         (g)   Warning signs shall be placed at appropriate locations to warn
of deep water, possible flood conditions during storm periods, and other
dangers that exist to pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      2.   Dry Bottom Detention Pond: A dry bottom detention pond may be
considered only when the construction of a wet detention pond is demonstrated
to be infeasible. Dry bottom detention ponds shall be designed in compliance
with all applicable requirements which govern the construction of wet bottom
detention basins. The following requirements shall apply to the design and
construction of dry bottom detention basins:
         (a)   Dry bottom storm water storage facilities should be designed
where possible to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space, or
similar types of uses which will not be adversely affected by occasional
intermittent flooding and will not interfere with storm water management.
         (b)   Minimum grades for turf area within the basin shall be two
percent (2%) (50 units horizontal to 1 unit vertical) except that the minimum
grade shall be one percent (1%) (100 units horizontal to 1 unit vertical) if
tile underdrain is adequately installed underneath the turf areas. Storage
facility side slopes shall not exceed three to one (3:1) (3 units horizontal to
1 unit vertical), shall provide for the reasonably safe approach of persons and
reasonably safe maintenance practices. Side slopes steeper than three to one
(3:1) may be allowed upon a determination by the reviewing authority that
adequate precautions are taken to avoid unreasonable hazard. Storage basin
excavations shall follow the natural land contours as closely as practicable.
The geometry of dry bottom storm water storage basins shall be approved by the
reviewing authority.
         (c)   Temporary seeding, sodding or other soil stabilization measures
as directed by the reviewing authority shall be established in the storm water
storage basin and excess storm water passageway immediately following the
construction or reconstruction of these facilities. During the construction of
the overall development, it is recognized that a limited amount of sediment
buildup may occur in the storm water storage facility due to erosion. In no
case shall the volume of the storage basin be reduced to less than ninety
percent (90%) of the required volume during the construction phase of the
development. Basins may be over excavated to provide additional storage volume
for anticipated sedimentation during construction activities.
         (d)   Permanent erosion control measures such as hydroseeding,
conventional seeding, nurse crops, fertilizing, or sod installation and
associated stabilization techniques such as mulching shall be utilized to
control soil movement and erosion within the storage area and excess storm
water passageway. These measures shall conform to the guidelines established in
the "Procedures And Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control
In Illinois". The installation of these permanent measures shall take place
only after the majority of construction and other silt and sediment producing
activities have been completed. Prior to the establishment of permanent erosion
control measures, the required capacity of the storm water storage area and the
excess storm water passageway shall, if necessary, be restored by excavation of
deposited material to provide one hundred percent (100%) of the required
storage volume. Upon completion of construction activities the storage volume
shall be certified in writing by an Illinois registered professional engineer.
The specific erosion control measures to be employed shall be included in an
erosion control plan to be approved by the reviewing authority.
         (e)   The outlet control structure shall be provided with an
interceptor for trash and debris, and it shall be designed and constructed to
minimize soil erosion and not to require manual adjustments for its proper
operation. The control structure shall be designed to operate properly with
minimal maintenance or attention. The control structure shall be provided with
safety screens for any pipe or opening, other than a weir, to prevent children
or large animals from crawling into structures. The control structure shall be
constructed to allow access to it at all times, including times of flood flow.
         (f)   Paved low flow conduits shall be provided in storm water storage
basins. These conduits shall be so constructed that they will not unnecessarily
interfere with any secondary use of the storage area and will reduce the
frequency of time that the storage area will be covered with water. These
conduits shall facilitate dewatering of the soils in the storm water storage
area to avoid saturated soil conditions. Low flow conduits shall facilitate
complete interior drainage of the storm water storage area. Tile underdrain
systems may be combined with the low flow conduits or channel systems.
         (g)   Pipe outlets of less than twelve inches (12") in diameter shall
not be allowed unless specifically approved by the reviewing authority.
Multiple outlet pipes from a storm water storage area shall be avoided.
         (h)   Warning signs shall be placed at appropriate locations to warn
of deep water, possible flood conditions during storm periods, and of other
dangers that exist to pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      3.   Alternative Storm Water Storage Areas: The use of the storm water
storage facilities as described in this chapter are the preferred means of
storm water storage. The following alternative means of storm water storage may
be used on development sites under two (2) acres in area or where practical
necessity makes the use of conventional storm water storage facilities
infeasible. The use of such alternative storm water storage areas is only
permitted upon the approval of the reviewing authority. Storage of storm water
runoff in public streets will not be allowed.
         (a)   Paved Storm Water Storage: Design and construction of the
pavement base must ensure that there is minimal pavement damage due to
flooding. Control structures in paved areas must be readily accessible for
maintenance and cleaning. Flow control devices will be required unless
otherwise approved by the reviewing authority.
         (b)   Rooftop Storm Water Storage: Rooftop storage of excess storm
water shall be designed and constructed to provide permanent control inlets and
parapet walls to contain excess storm water. Adequate structural roof design
must be provided to ensure that roof deflection does not occur which could
cause the roofing material to fail and result in leakage. Overflow areas must
be provided to ensure that the weight of storm water will never exceed the
structural capacity of the roof. Any rooftop storage of excess storm water
shall be approved only upon submission of building plans signed and sealed by
an Illinois licensed structural engineer or architect attesting to the
structural adequacy of the design.
         (c)   Automobile Parking Lot Storage Areas: Automobile parking lots
may be designed to provide temporary detention storage on a portion of their
surfaces. Automobile parking facilities used to store excess storm water may be
constructed having a maximum depth of stored storm water of 0.6 foot; and these
areas shall be located in the most remote, least used area of the parking
facility. Parking lot storm water detention shall not be permitted in areas
containing handicapped parking areas. Design and construction of automobile
parking in storm water areas must ensure that there is minimal damage to the
parking facility due to flooding, including minimal damage to the subbase.
Warning signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn of possible
flood conditions during storm periods.
         (d)   Underground Storm Water Storage: Underground storm water storage
facilities must be designed for easy access in order to remove accumulated
sediment and debris. These facilities must be provided with a positive gravity
outlet unless otherwise approved by the reviewing authority. (2005 Code)
7-4-7: PROTECTING EXISTING DRAINAGE:
   (A)   Natural Drainage:
      1.   Existing perennial streams shall not be modified to accommodate on
site flows of storm water. Stream banks may be modified, however, incident to
the installation of an excess storm water runoff outfall, necessary to ensure
safety or bank stabilization, and/or for the improvement of aquatic habitats.
      2.   Other natural drainage features such as depressional storage areas
and swales shall be incorporated into the drainage system.
   (B)   Agricultural Drainage Improvements:
      1.   The outlet for existing agricultural drainage tile will be located
and the capacity of the outlet shall be maintained for the watershed upstream
of the development area.
      2.   Existing easements for any agricultural drainage tile located
underneath areas that will be developed shall be preserved. If no easement
exists an easement shall be granted for access and maintenance as provided in
this chapter. Such easements shall be of sufficient width and located to
provide for continued functioning and necessary maintenance of drainage
facilities. No buildings or permanent structures including paved areas but
excluding streets, sidewalks, or driveways, which cross the easement by the
shortest possible route may be located within the easement without the consent
and approval of any public body to which the easement is granted.
      3.   All agricultural drainage tile located underneath areas that will be
developed shall be replaced with nonperforated conduit to prevent root blockage
provided, however, that drainage district tile may remain with the approval of
the drainage district.
      4.   Agricultural drainage tile which, due to development, will be
located underneath roadways, drives, or parking shall be replaced with ductile
iron, or reinforced concrete pipe or equivalent material approved by the
reviewing authority as needed to prevent the collapse of the agricultural
drainage conduit.
      5.   Agricultural drainage tile may be relocated within development areas
upon approval of the reviewing authority. Such relocation shall maintain
sufficient slope and capacity to prevent sedimentation and to prevent an
increase in scouring or structural damage to the conduit. Such relocation shall
only be with the consent and approval of the drainage district, which is
responsible for maintaining the tile. If the tile is not under the authority of
a drainage district the reviewing authority shall consider the interests of
those landowners who are served by the tile.
      6.   No storm sewer inlet, outlet, or detention basin outlet shall be
connected to farm drainage tile unless flow is restricted to an amount equal to
or less than the discharge capacity of the tile. Such connection shall only be
made with the consent and approval of the drainage district responsible for
maintaining the tile. If the tile is not under the authority of a drainage
district the reviewing authority shall consider the interests of those
landowners who are served by the tile.
      7.   No fill shall be placed nor grade altered in such a manner that it
will cause surface water upstream of the development to pond or direct surface
flows in such a way as to create a nuisance.
      8.   All surface runoff water shall exit the development at such a
velocity which will not cause erosion. All subsurface flows shall exit the
development at such a velocity so as to prevent an increase in scouring or
structural damage to off site tile drains.
      9.   Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance and exit losses
as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert. (Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
7-4-7-1: EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL:
   (A)   The developer shall take such steps as necessary to minimize soil
erosion during and after construction. If there is a threat of erosion, the
village may require an erosion control plan to be submitted with engineering
plans. The erosion control plan shall conform to all applicable portions of the
latest edition of "Procedures And Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And
Sedimentation Control In Illinois". A copy of this publication is available for
inspection at the office of the village engineer. Further, the following
factors shall always be observed during any phase of development construction:
      1.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left
undisturbed whenever possible.
      2.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
      3.   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development in
accordance with this chapter.
      4.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development. (2005 Code)
7-4-8: EASEMENTS:
Easements to the village, drainage district or other public authority to
provide for maintenance of public drainage facilities which serve the site and
which are or are to be dedicated to, owned by, or under the control of such
public authority shall be granted to further this policy when the need for such
facility is in whole or in part specifically and uniquely attributable to the
proposed development. All known agricultural drainage tile located underneath
areas to be developed shall be granted an easement if no written easement
exists prior to development. Such easement shall be approved in writing by the
public body to which they are granted and recorded in the Champaign County
recorder's office before the reviewing authority issues any final approval
except in the case of subdivisions where such easements are shown on the plat.
(Ord. 99-11, 11-9-1999)
7-4-9: RULE OF CONSTRUCTION:
These policy guidelines shall be construed liberally in the interests of the
public so as to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. (Ord. 99-11,
11-9-1999)
7-4-10: VARIANCES:
The granting of variances is not consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
It is, therefore, essential that every effort be made to comply with the
requirements contained in this chapter.
   (A)   Only the board of trustees may grant a variance. When, in the opinion
of a developer, the standards of this chapter place an undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply for a variance. The
village engineer shall review the applicant's request, prepare a recommendation
and a public hearing before the planning commission shall be scheduled on the
matter in a manner prescribed by the board of trustees. The board of trustees
shall rule on the variance at its earliest convenience, after the hearing.
   (B)   A variance may be granted by the board of trustees if the applicant
demonstrates all of the following:
      1.   The property cannot yield a reasonable return if the variance is not
granted;
      2.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      3.   There will be no threat to public health and safety or to beneficial
stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation of a
nuisance;
      4.   There will be no additional public expense such as for flood
protection, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to streambeds and
banks, roads, utilities, or other public facilities;
      5.   The applicant's circumstances are unique such that the proposed
variance will not serve as a special privilege, but will alleviate a
demonstrable hardship not shared by other property;
      6.   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved including existing stream uses;
      7.   All other agency permits have been obtained;
      8.   The applicant did not know or deliberately place himself or herself
in the position of hardship;
      9.   Such other considerations applicable to the particular property as
determined by the board of trustees.
   (C)   The village may require an independent study and report by a qualified
professional engineer or other appropriate qualified professionals, the cost of
which shall be paid by the applicant for the variance. The purpose of the study
shall be to provide evaluations of the applicant's proposed development as they
may affect stream flows and hydraulic characteristics of the watercourse and to
also evaluate possible alternatives to the applicant's proposal. (Ord. 99-11,
11-9-1999)
7-4-11: SUBMITTALS:

frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Electric Distribution Systems: The wireless provider shall not
collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of
an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker
safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Public Safety: The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility
pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in
place on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located
within three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or
wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         (b)   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in the Village zoning ordinance.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right- of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   (E)   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing
utility poles or wireless support structures.
      2.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      3.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      4.   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with subsection (C)2(a)(4) of this section; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (F)   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this section authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this section do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: a) to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this section.
   (G)   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this section.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village
makes available under this section for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the Village
that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement
remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the Village's
utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before the
wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this
paragraph.
   (H)   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after
the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent
to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   (I)   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells or
transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider.
   (J)   Dispute Resolution: The Circuit Court of Champaign Illinois shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for
collocation of small wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the
right-of-way, the Village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on
its poles at annual rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per
year per Municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final
resolution of the dispute.
   (K)   Indemnification: A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the
Village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or
property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use
or occupancy of the Village improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this section and the
Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall
further waive any claims that they may have against the Village with respect to
consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the
theory of liability.
   (L)   Insurance: The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless
provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance:
      1.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      2.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      3.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to
the collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage limits required by the Village. (Ord. 2018-9, 7-24-2018,

   (A)   Existing Illegal Structures And Uses: A structure or use that is
illegal at the time of the adoption of, but is made legal by the provisions of

      1.   If a structure or land is used in a manner that was classified as a
permitted use prior to the effective date of this title, and now that use is
classified as a special use as of the effective date of this title, that use is
deemed a lawful special use. Any subsequent addition, enlargement or expansion
of that use must conform to the procedural and substantive requirements of this
title for special uses.
      2.   If a structure or land is used in a manner that was classified as a
special use prior to the effective date of this title, and that use is now

the effective date of this title was a conforming lot before the effective date
of this title, but such lot does not meet all standards set forth in this title
in the zoning district in which it is located, that lot is deemed a
nonconforming lot of record and is controlled by the provisions of Chapter 10-

completed in accordance with the plans on the basis of which the building
permit was issued and may, upon completion, be occupied under an occupancy
permit for the use originally intended.

variations granted prior to the effective date of this title, except as deemed
permitted or legal by this title, remain in full force and effect. The
recipient of the special use or variation may proceed to develop the property
in accordance with the approved plans and all applicable conditions. However,
if the recipient has failed to act on the special use or variation before the
approval expires, including any periods of extension granted, the provisions of
this title will govern.
   (G)   Previous Adopted Zoning Ordinances: Existing structures and uses that
were in compliance with previous Zoning Ordinances or previously permitted, and
not in compliance with current Zoning Ordinance, shall be grandfathered in
under new Zoning Ordinances, until such time that property owner requests or
proposes changes to property dimensions, zoning district, structure, land use,
setbacks, or variances. At such time of request, proposed modifications shall
follow current title version. Existing structures or uses that were not
previously in compliance with past Zoning Ordinances or previously permitted,
except for subsection (A) above, shall remain out of compliance with new Zoning
Ordinances.
   (H)   Pending Applications: An application that has been deemed complete and
scheduled for a public hearing or meeting, as applicable, is subject to the
title requirements in effect on the date the application was deemed complete.

extended height over one hundred fifty five feet (155') shall include a shadow
flicker study. The applicant has the burden of providing evidence that the
shadow flicker will not have significant adverse impact. Using available
software, the applicant shall show calculated locations of shadow flicker
caused by the wind energy system and the expected duration in total number of
hours per year of the flicker cast upon adjacent dwellings and within the
boundary of adjacent residentially zoned lots. Potential shadow flicker must be
addressed either through siting or through other approved mitigation measures.
         (j)   Sound Level Limitations: No wind energy system or combination of
wind energy systems on a single lot shall create noise that exceeds the
regulatory standards set by the Illinois EPA Pollution Control Board at any
property line where the wind energy system is located. Measurement of sound
levels shall not be adjusted for, or averaged with, non-operating periods. Any
wind energy system exceeding this level shall immediately cease operation upon
notification by the Village Board and may not resume operation until the noise
levels have been reduced in compliance with the required standards and verified
by an independent third-party inspector, approved by the Village, at the
property owner's expense. Only upon Village Board review and acceptance of the
third-party noise level report, may the wind energy system resume operation.
   (J)   Additional Permit Application Requirements: In addition to the
requirements established in chapter 10-10 for a zoning permit application and

the customer's intent to install an interconnected customer-owned generator.
Off-grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
      5.   Such evidence and documentation as required verifying that the wind
energy system meets all other zoning ordinance requirements.
   (K)   Maintenance: All wind energy systems shall be maintained in good
condition and in safe working order throughout the life of the system. If the
system is not maintained in operational condition and/or poses a potential
safety hazard, the owner shall immediately correct the situation at the expense
of the owner. Any wind energy system found to be unsafe by the Village Board or
appointed designee, must stop operation immediately upon notification. If the
owner fails to correct the unsafe condition, the Village Board may remove or
cause to be removed, altered or repaired, at cost to the owner, an unsafe wind
energy system immediately and without notice, if, in his/her opinion, the
condition of the system is such as to present an immediate threat to the safety
of the public.
   (L)   Removal of an Inoperable Wind Energy System: The Wind Energy
Conversion System or individual turbine is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance if it has been inoperable or has not been operated to generate any
electricity for one hundred eighty (180) or more consecutive days. If a wind
energy system is derelict for one hundred eighty (180) or more consecutive
days, the owner shall be notified that they must, within six (6) months of
receiving the notice, restore their system to operating condition. If the owner
(s) fails to restore their system to operating condition within the six (6)
month period, then the owner shall be required, at the expense of the owner, to
remove the wind energy system. Removal of a wind energy system that constitutes
a public nuisance shall include removal of the turbines, tower, and any above
ground improvements, including fencing. If the owner fails to remove the wind
energy system within one month, the Village Board or appointed designee shall
send a notice that the wind energy system is in violation of the Zoning
Ordinance and subject to a daily fine as provided for in this title.
   (M)   Violation: Should a wind energy system or any part thereof violate the
requirements of this section, the owner shall cease operations immediately.
Upon receipt of a complaint or the notice of a complaint from the owner, the
Village Board shall make a determination as to whether there is a violation
requiring the immediate cessation of operation. The system may resume operation
once the violation(s) have been remedied.
   (N)   Pre-Existing Wind Energy Systems:
      1.   Pre-existing wind energy systems shall be allowed to continue.
Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such pre-existing systems.
      2.   A zoning permit and any other necessary zoning and development
approvals shall be obtained to alter, enlarge, extend, replace or relocate a
pre-existing wind energy system.
      3.   If a pre-existing wind energy system is nonconforming with this
Section, it shall not be altered, enlarged, extended or relocated such that the
nonconformity of the system is increased.

In computing the number of required off street parking spaces, the following
rules shall apply:
   (A)   Floor area shall mean the gross floor area of the specified use,
excluding any floor or portion thereof used for parking, as herein defined.
   (B)   Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be
the nearest whole number.
   (C)   In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the
sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
   (D)   Whenever a building or use constructed or established after 2005 is
changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling
units, seating capacity or otherwise, parking spaces shall be provided on the
basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use existing prior
to 2005, is reconstructed or is enlarged to the extent of twenty percent (20%)
or more in floor area, said building or use in its entirety shall then and
thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth herein. Any
enlargement or change in use of less than twenty percent (20%) of the gross
floor area shall be provided with additional parking based on the enlargement
or change. (Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)
10-7-3: LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES:
All parking spaces required herein shall be located as follows:
   (A)   Parking In Front Yards: Parking in required front yards is permitted
in accordance with the following regulations. All parking shall be upon an
approved surface as defined in section
10-7-5 of this chapter.
      1.   In any residential district or agricultural district, parking in the
front yard is required to be located directly in front of the garage door(s),
when present, to minimize paving of the front yard. Provided that such area
devoted to parking and access thereto shall not exceed forty five percent (45%)
of total lot width.
Parking spaces provided in this manner shall not be enclosed, covered, or
otherwise obstructed. Any truck of over ¾ ton capacity shall not be parked in
such spaces.
      2.   In the Downtown Commercial District, General Commercial, or
Industrial Districts, parking spaces may be situated in a required front yard
provided that the parking lot meets the design standards for parking lots in
this chapter and provided that for such properties located on Warren Street or
Main Street, no parking space shall be permitted where the existing vehicle
must be backed into or out of said public streets.
   (B)   Parking in Side or Rear Yards: Parking in required side or rear yards
is permitted on an approved surface as defined in section
10-7-5 of this chapter.
   (C)   Recreational Vehicles, Watercraft, And Commercial Vehicles: In
residential districts, the following shall regulate the parking of recreational
vehicles, watercraft, and off the road vehicles:

         (c)   Outside in the front yard at least five feet (5') from the front
lot line provided:
            (1)   Said parking is for loading and unloading operations
completed within a twenty four (24) hour period; and
            (2)   Space is not available in the side yard, or there is no
reasonable access to either the side yard or rear yard. A lot shall be deemed
to have reasonable access to the rear yard if terrain permits and access can be
had without substantial damage to existing large trees or landscaping. A corner
lot shall be deemed to have reasonable access to the rear yard.
      3.   The length of the watercraft for the purpose of this Subsection (C)
shall not include any portion of any trailer used for transporting the
watercraft that extends beyond the watercraft itself.
      4.   No more than two commercial vehicles shall be parked on the lot at
any onetime. Commercial vehicles stored outside must be parked on an approved
driveway or parking space. Such commercial vehicles shall not exceed ¾ ton
capacity and shall be used by an occupant of the dwelling for personal or
business transportation. Commercial vehicles engaged in a lawful construction
or service operation on the site are exempt from this requirement.
   (D)   Parking Facilities Off Site; Permitted Locations:
      1.   Required off street parking facilities for residential uses must be
provided on the same lot where the residential use is located, except as
provided under special use provisions for R-3 and R-4 Districts.
      2.   Any off street parking facilities that are not provided on the same
lot as the principal use, other than single-family or two-family residential
uses in a residential zoning district, can be located by right in the same
zoning district as the principal use except that off street parking facilities
for nonresidential uses in residential zoning districts shall only be allowed
by special use permit. These lots may be located immediately adjacent to the
use or within three hundred feet (300') of the principal use.
      3.   If the principal use is or becomes a nonconforming use, expansion of
the off street parking facilities which are not located on the site of the
principal use is not permitted.
      4.   The distance specified herein and the distances specified in the
district use regulations shall be measured from the nearest point of the
parking facility to the nearest point of the lot occupied by the building or
use that such facility is required to serve.
   (E)   Required Covenants For Off Site Parking: When off street parking
facilities are provided on a lot other than the lot upon which the building or
use requiring such facilities is located, the owner of the lot upon which the
principal use is located and the owner of the lot upon which parking is
provided, shall execute a written covenant containing at least the following
terms:
      1.   In consideration of the issuance of a zoning permit for the
principal use, the lot or portion of the lot on which the parking facility is
located will be used and maintained solely for off street parking purposes for
such principal use, describing the premises for which said parking is provided.
      2.   Such covenant shall be in effect so long as the structures
comprising such principal use continue to exist without sufficient parking
elsewhere or upon the lot with the principal use.
      3.   The parking lot or portion of the parking lot shall contain
appropriate signage to indicate that certain parking spaces are reserved for
the use herein described.

10-11-5: VARIANCES:
   (A)   A variance is a relaxation of the requirements of this title that are
applicable to a particular lot or structure.
   (B)   A so-called "use variance" that would allow a use that is neither a
permitted nor a special use in the district in question is not a variance, but
it is an amendment. Amendment requests shall be addressed only as provided for
in section
10-11-7 of this chapter.
   (C)   Application: Every application for a variance shall be filed with the
Village Office on a prescribed form. A fee for a variance application as

      3.   Brief description of adjacent lots, structures, and/or uses;
      4.   Brief description of the problems/circumstances engendering the

subject property;
      2.   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
village; and
      3.   By first-class mail to record owners of property located within two
hundred fifty feet (250') of the subject property.
   (E)   Standards For Variances:
      1.   The PZC shall not recommend any variance unless they find that the
proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of this title, and
that the strict application of the district requirements would result in great
practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant. More specifically, the PZC
shall not decide upon a variance unless they determine, based upon the evidence
presented to them, that:
         (a)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
that zone;
         (b)   The plight of the owner is due to peculiar circumstances; and
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.

regulations imposed by this title to permit:
         (a)   The reduction of the depth or width of a required yard specified
in the chapter 10-3 district standards, or if not specified in chapter 10-3,
the reduction of the depth or width of a required yard by not more than twenty
five percent (25%) of the depth or width required by this title; and
         (b)   In the General Commercial District, to permit a reduction in the
number of off-street parking spaces required about or in connection with a use,
and for the same district to permit greater coverage than required by the
applicable regulations and to permit the use of a lot for a use otherwise
prohibited solely because of the insufficient area of the lot.
   (F)   PZC Recommendation To Village Board:
      1.   The PZC findings of fact shall clearly indicate the PZC's reasons
for recommending that a requested variance be granted or denied.
      2.   Following a public hearing at the PZC, the Village Clerk shall

access ways;
         (k)   Identification and location of all existing or proposed
utilities, whether public or private;
         (l)   Location of any signs; and
         (m)   Other pertinent information.

Village Board and listed in the Village Schedule of Permits and Fees must
accompany each special use permit application.
   (C)   Public Hearing, Notice: The PZC Chair shall fix a reasonable time for
the public hearing on each special use permit request upon the submittal of a
completed special use permit application. At the hearing, any interested party
may appear and testify, either in person or by duly authorized agent or
attorney.
The Village Board shall arrange for notice of the public hearing, indicating
the time, date, and place of the hearing, and the nature of the requested

village; and
      3.   By first class mail to the record owners of property located within
two hundred fifty feet (250') of the subject property.
   (D)   Special Use Permit Standards: Following public input received at the
public hearing, the PZC shall make Findings of Fact with regard to each special
use permit request considered. The PZC may recommend and the Village Board, in
turn, may impose such conditions as will, in the judgement of each respective
body, with regard to and to ensure that:
      1.   The proposed special use permit is necessary for the public
convenience at that location.
      2.   The proposed design, location, and manner of operation of the
special use permit requested will adequately protect the public health, safety,
and welfare, and the physical environment.
      3.   The intensity of the proposed development does not impose any
adverse effects on surrounding property, public utilities and on the traffic
circulation on nearby streets.
      4.   The proposed special use permit is compatible with surrounding land
use.
      5.   The proposed special use permit requested conforms to the intent,
regulations, and standards of and preserves the essential character of the
district in which it is proposed to be located.
   (E)   PZC Findings Of Fact And Recommendation To Village Board:
      1.   The PZC findings of fact shall clearly indicate the PZC's reasons
for recommending that a requested special use permit be granted or denied.
      2.   Following a public hearing at the PZC, the Village Clerk shall
provide the PZC recommendation to the Village Board on the special use permit
request along with the written statement of the PZC Findings of Fact on which
the recommendation is based.
      3.   The PZC may recommend and the Village Board may prescribe special
conditions for a special use to preserve the general public health, safety and
welfare, and these terms and conditions of the special use (if any) shall be
specified in one statement.
   (F)   Village Board Decision:
      1.   The Village Board, upon receiving a the PZC Findings of Fact and
recommendation, shall act upon said recommendation within a reasonable period
of time and shall either accept or reverse the recommendation in whole or in
part or return the request to the PZC for further study.
      2.   It shall require two-thirds vote of all Village Board members to
reverse a recommendation of denial received from the PZC.
      3.   A copy of the Village Board decision shall be transmitted to the
applicant or appellant. (Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)

CHAPTER 12
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
10-12-1: General Applicability
10-12-2: Nonconforming Use
10-12-3: Nonconforming Structure
10-12-4: Nonconforming Lot Of Record
10-12-5: Nonconforming Signs
10-12-1: GENERAL APPLICABILITY:
   (A)   Authority To Continue: Any structure, lot, or use that lawfully
existed as a nonconformity as of the effective date of this title, and any
lawfully existing structure, lot, or use that has been made nonconforming as of
the effective date of this title and any subsequent amendments, may continue
subject to the provisions of this chapter so long as it remains otherwise
legal. A structure, lot, or use that is illegal as of the effective date of
this title, remains illegal if it does not conform to every requirement of this
title.
   (B)   Burden on Property Owner: The burden of establishing the legality of
nonconformity under the provisions of this title is the responsibility of the
property owner of the nonconforming structure or lot, or the operator of the
use.
   (C)   Safety Regulations: All police power regulations enacted to promote
public health, safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all building,
fire and health codes apply to nonconformities. (Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)
10-12-2: NONCONFORMING USE:
   (A)   Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed
on a structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use,
provided it does not create any new nonconformity or increase the intensity of
the nonconformity.
   (B)   Structural Alterations: No structural alterations are permitted on any
structure devoted to a nonconforming use, except in the following situations:
      1.   When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore
the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with
protecting public safety,
      2.   When the alteration is for the purpose of bringing about a
conforming use, or
      3.   When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or
increase the intensity of any existing nonconformity.
   (C)   Expansion: A nonconforming use of a structure of land cannot be
expanded, extended, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited
activity includes additions or enlargements of any structure devoted entirely
to a nonconforming use, and any expansion, extension, or relocation of a
nonconforming use to any other structure, any portion of the floor area, or any
land area currently not occupied by such nonconforming use.
   (D)   Relocation: A nonconforming use of a structure or land cannot be
relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot or
parcel. The nonconforming use may only be relocated to another structure or lot
if the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is
relocated.
   (E)   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use cannot be changed to any use other
than one allowed within the zoning district where it is located. When a
nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part, to an allowed use, the
whole or part that conforms cannot be changed back to a use that is not allowed
in the district. A change of use occurs when an existing nonconforming use has
been terminated and another use has commenced. Any change in use in violation
of this title is deemed an abandonment of the previously existing nonconforming
use.
   (F)   Discontinuation Or Abandonment: If a nonconforming use is
discontinued, or the structure that it occupies becomes vacant and remains
unoccupied for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180) days, the
nonconforming use is deemed abandoned and cannot be reestablished or resumed
regardless of intent. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure
must comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which the structure
or land is located. A period of discontinuance caused by acts of God or other
events without any contributing fault by the user are not included in
calculating the length of discontinuance for this section.
   (G)   Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part
to a nonconforming use is structurally damaged or destroyed through no fault of
the property owner or tenant, the nonconforming use may be re-established
provided that no new nonconformities are created and the degree of the previous
nonconformity is not increased.
      2.   If the structure containing the nonconforming use is a nonconforming
structure, the structure may only be rebuilt, restored, repaired, or
reconstructed in accordance with the provisions of section
10-12-3 (Nonconforming Structure). (Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)
10-12-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE:
   (A)   Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed
on any nonconforming structure. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that
would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously
existing nonconformity.
   (B)   Structural Alterations: No structural alterations are permitted on any
nonconforming structure, except in the following situations:
      1.   When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore
the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with
protecting public safety;
      2.   When the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity; or
      3.   When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or
increase the degree of any existing nonconformity. For example, if a structure
is nonconforming in terms of the required front setback (i.e., does not meet
the required minimum), the structure may add a rear addition if it meets all
other bulk and setback requirements of the district.
   (C)   Relocation: A nonconforming structure cannot be relocated, in whole or
in part, to any other location on the same lot unless such relocation would
make the structure conforming. A nonconforming structure may be relocated to
another lot if the structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district
where it is relocated.
   (D)   Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   In the event that a nonconforming structure is structurally damaged
or destroyed by the fault of the property owner or tenant, the structure, as
restored or repaired, must comply with all requirements of this title.
      2.   Damage To Nonconforming Structure Exceeding Sixty Percent (60%) Of
Replacement Value Through No Fault Of Property Owner Or Tenant: In the event
that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, through no fault of
the property owner or tenant, to the extent of sixty percent (60%) or more of
its replacement value at the time, then the structure may not be restored or
rebuilt unless the structure, including the foundation, conforms to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located; provided however
that a legally nonconforming residential dwelling may be rebuilt and used as a
residential dwelling if restoration is completed and occupancy taken within two
(2) years from the date of damage. In such an event, a zoning permit must be
obtained to rebuild, restore, repair, or reconstruct the legally nonconforming
residential dwelling.
      3.   Damage To Nonconforming Structure Of Less Than Sixty Percent (60%)
Of Replacement Value Through No Fault Of Property Owner Or Tenant: When a
nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, through no fault of the
property owner or tenant, to the extent of less than sixty percent (60%) of the
replacement value at the time, it may be repaired and reconstructed provided
that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree of the
nonconformity is not increased. A zoning permit must be obtained for such
rebuilding, restoration, repair, for reconstruction within one year of the date
of damage or destruction. In the event that the zoning permit is not obtained
within one year, then the structure cannot be restored unless it conforms to
all regulations of the district in which it is located.
      4.   The replacement value of the structure is based on:
         (a)   The sale of that structure within the previous year or, if that
is not applicable;
         (b)   An appraisal within the last two (2) years or, if that is not
available;
         (c)   The amount for which the structure was insured prior to the date
of the damage or destruction; or,
         (d)   An alternative method determined acceptable by the Village
Board.
   (E)   Removal And Replacement Exception: A legally nonconforming residential
dwelling may be removed and replaced with a new comparable nonconforming
residential dwelling upon granting of a variance by the Village Board after a
public hearing before the PZC, if the following conditions are determined by
the Village Board to exist:
      1.   That due to old age, dilapidated, or dangerous condition of the
existing structure, said structure has an adverse effect on the neighborhood
and owner, and repairs and restoration would be difficult, impractical and/or
not cost effective; and
      2.   The Village Board determines that to allow such removal and
replacement would not significantly impact the growth and development plans of
the Village as established in the Village comprehensive plan; and
      3.   Failure to receive a variance to remove and replace the said
structure would cause an undue hardship on the owner.
The removal and replacement of said structure shall be completed within one
year of the date of the granting of the variance or the variance shall be void.
(Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)
10-12-4: NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD:
   (A)   Definition: A nonconforming lot of record is a lot of record that
lawfully conformed to the lot dimension requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located, but because of subsequent amendments to this title no
longer conforms to the applicable lot dimensions.
   (B)   Use: Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
title, a nonconforming lot of record may be used for a permitted or special use
within the zoning district.
   (C)   Development: Development of a nonconforming lot of record must meet
all applicable public health and safety provisions of Title 7, and dimensional
or bulk regulations of the district in which it is located with the exception
of the lot dimension requirement that renders it nonconforming.
   (D)   Common Ownership Limitation: If two (2) or more lots of record have
contiguous frontage in common ownership as of the effective date of this title
and one or more of the lots does not meet the requirements for lot dimensions
as established by this title, the lots involved are considered to be a single
lot for the purposes of this title. No division of the lot is permitted that
creates a nonconforming lot and/or renders the remaining lot(s) nonconforming.
No zoning permit will be issued for the use of any lot or portion of a lot,
transferred or conveyed in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)
10-12-5: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
   (A)   Any sign lawfully existing or under construction on the effective date
of this title that does not conform to one or more of the provisions of this
title may be continued in operation and maintained indefinitely as a
nonconforming sign subject to compliance with this title.
   (B)   Routine maintenance of nonconforming signs is allowed, including
changing of copy, necessary non-structural repairs, and incidental alterations
that do not expand, extend or enlarge the nonconforming features of the sign.
However, no structural alteration, enlargement, or expansion may be made to a
nonconforming sign unless the alteration, enlargement, or expansion will result
in the elimination of the nonconforming features of the sign.
   (C)   Removal Or Modification Of Nonconforming Sign:
      1.   A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be
removed or modified to comply with these regulations if:
         (a)   The structure to which it is accessory is demolished or
destroyed to an extent exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the structure's
assessed value;
         (b)   The sign and sign structure is demolished or destroyed to an
extent exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost; or
         (c)   If the business or use on the property ceases to operate for a
continuous period of three months or more.
      2.   Such nonconforming sign and sign structure subject to removal under
this paragraph must be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner or lessee
of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the Zoning
Administrator must give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of
this subsection and the sign must be removed within thirty (30) days of such
notice.
      3.   If such sign is not removed or modified after the 30-day period, the
Village Board may take action to authorize the removal of the sign and sign
structure at the expense of the owner, agent, or person having beneficial
interest in the building or premises on which the sign is located. In addition,
the Village is authorized to institute and pursue all other available remedies
and penalties under the law. (Ord. 2021-04, 6-22-2021)

the Village comprehensive plan and applicable Municipal development plans, or
parts thereof.
An area general plan may be prepared and submitted by the subdivider, for
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission, prior to the submission of the
initial preliminary plat. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine if
either of the following conditions exists to warrant requirement of preparation
and submission of an area general plan:
   (A)   The parcel initially proposed for platting constitutes a portion of a
larger tract of land owned, or under option to purchase by the subdivider. If
the parcel of land proposed for platting exceeds five (5) acres, an area
general plan shall be required. If the parcel of land proposed for platting
does not exceed five (5) acres, an area general plan may be required if deemed
appropriate by the Planning and Zoning Commission or Board.
   (B)   The parcel initially proposed for platting constitutes a portion of a
larger land area, the development of which will be complicated by unusual
problems of drainage, street layout, utility services, land usage, or land
ownership pattern. An area general plan may be required if deemed appropriate
by the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board. (2005 Code; amd. Ord. 2017-
2, 3-28-2017, eff. 4-8-2017)

installation, all in accordance with the requirements of this title. Upon
approval of the improvements, or arrangements therefor, the final plat shall be
submitted in accordance with the provisions and requirements of chapter 4 of
this title. No plat or replat shall be filed for record or recorded in the
Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Champaign County, Illinois, unless and until
the approval of the Board is endorsed thereon by the Village Clerk, and no lot
shall be sold from such plat or replat unless and until approved by the Board
and filed for record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in Champaign
County, Illinois, as herein provided. (2005 Code)
11-2-4: SUBDIVISION RESTRICTIONS:
Any subdivision plat approved by the Board shall contain the following
language:
In the event any restriction imposed by the subdivider on the subdivision land
at the time of the platting is changed by the consent of the required number of
owners owning the lots of said subdivision, then such change shall be
ineffective until approved by the Board of Trustees of the Village of St.
Joseph if said change concerns easements, drainage, stormwater management,
utilities, annexation, or other matter of concern to or involving the Village.
In the event such subdivision restrictions fail to contain the aforesaid
language, then by operation of law in accordance with this section,
restrictions imposed upon said subdivision shall include the above language and
no subdivision restrictions may be changed or altered in any way without the
consent of the Board. (2005 Code)
11-2-5: MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS:
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in this title would result in real
difficulties or substantial hardship or injustice, the Board, after report by
the commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider may
develop his/her/its property in a reasonable manner, but so that, at the same
time, the public welfare and interests of the Village and surrounding area are
protected and the general intent and spirit of this title preserved. The
granting of variances is not consistent with the purpose of this title. It is
therefore essential that every effort be made to comply with the requirements
contained in this title. (2005 Code)

other physical features of the property and shall meet the following
requirements and standards:
   (A)   Relation To Adjoining Street System: The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the existing streets
in adjoining areas (or their proper projection where adjoining land is not
subdivided) insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public requirements.
The street and alley arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing
convenient access to it. Offset streets shall be avoided. The angle of
intersection between minor streets and major streets shall not vary by more
than ten degrees (10°) from a right angle. Streets obviously in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Proposed street
names that are in conflict with existing street names shall not be approved.
   (B)   Street And Alley Width:
      1.   The minimum right of way width for arterial streets shall be eighty
feet (80'), with a minimum surface width of thirty six feet (36') between the

engineering study to determine appropriate road geometry and cross section, the
cost of which shall be borne by the developer and which traffic engineering
study shall be prepared by the village engineers or other firm approved by the
village.
      6.   The village may modify requirements for surface width upon results
of traffic analysis on the village engineer's recommendation.
      7.   When a street adjoins an unsubdivided property, a half street of at
least thirty feet (30') in width shall be dedicated and whenever the property
being subdivided adjoins a half street, the remainder of the street shall be
dedicated.
      8.   Alleys may be provided in a residential block and, where provided,
shall have a dedicated width of at least sixteen feet (16'). Alleys are
required at the rear of all commercial lots unless other adequate provisions
are made for service and deliveries, and shall be at least twenty feet (20')
wide.

dedicated on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where
necessary, for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water or
other utilities. Easements of greater width may be required along or across
lots where necessary for the extension of main sewers or other utilities or
where both water and sewer lines are located in the same easements.
   (D)   Blocks:
      1.   No block shall be longer than one thousand three hundred twenty feet
(1,320'). Where blocks are over seven hundred fifty feet (750') in length, a
walkway with a right of way of at least ten feet (10') in width may be required
through the block near the center of the block.
      2.   Courts, dead end streets or other street space may be provided if
proper access is given to all lots from a dedicated street or court. All dead
end streets shall terminate in a circular dedicated street space having a
minimum radius of sixty feet (60') with minimum surface radius of fifty feet
(50'), or other satisfactory arrangement for turning of vehicles. Dead end
streets shall not exceed seven hundred fifty feet (750') in length. A dead end
street shall be measured from the far edge of the pavement at the dead end, to
the near edge of the first intersecting street with two (2) directions of
departure (straight ahead counts as 1 direction of departure).
   (E)   Lots:
      1.   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and to the character of surrounding development.
      2.   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines except where a variation of this rule
will provide a better street and lot layout. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
      3.   No lot shall have a depth of less than one hundred feet (100') or a
depth in excess of three (3) times its width unless approved by the board. No
lot shall have an area or width less than that required by any zoning ordinance
or resolution in effect within the area.

establishment of front building lines on both the adjoining streets.
      5.   Lots at arterial and collector street intersections and at acute
angle intersections of less than eighty five degrees (85°) shall have a radius
of twenty feet (20') at the street corner. On commercial lots, a chord may be
substituted for the circular arc.
   (F)   Easements Along Streams: Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in an area being subdivided, the subdivider shall
provide an adequate easement along each side of the stream for the preservation
of the stream and its associated floodplain. Such easement shall be dedicated
to the village or other appropriate public agency. Said easement does not
relieve the developer, its successors or assigns, from the obligation of long
term maintenance of the stream or drainage course. (2005 Code)

title to be built by subdivider shall be constructed as required in this title.
"Subdivision improvement" is any and all improvements required to be
constructed by this title or as a condition of final plat approval of the
subdivision.
         (b)   The subdivider shall complete construction of all subdivision
improvements in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
village engineer within two (2) years of the date the village approves the
final plat of the subdivision. At the subdivider's request, the board may
extend the time period in which to complete the construction for an additional
two (2) years if the board finds that such an extension is consistent with the
public welfare.
         (c)   This surety shall be one of the following:
            (1) Corporate surety bond as approved by village attorney.
            (2) Cash, held without interest; or if requested by developer, an

number, and developer to pay all costs of establishing and maintaining said
account.
            (3) Irrevocable letter of credit as approved by village attorney.
The amount of the performance guarantee and surety shall be based on the
estimated value of the improvements at the time of approval of the subdivision,

performance bond and surety shall be as follows:
   A. If the improvements are one percent (1%) to seventy five percent (75%)
completed, one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of
completing the remaining improvements, but in no case shall the bond and surety

improvements.
   B. If the improvements are more than seventy five percent (75%) completed,
two hundred percent (200%) of the estimated cost of completing the remaining
improvements, but in no case shall the bond and surety be less than fifteen
percent (15%) of the cost of all the public improvements.
Upon substantial completion of major segments of public improvements with
appropriate documentation submitted by the developer's engineer, and after
initial tentative acceptance of the completed improvements by the village, the
amount of the performance guarantee may be reduced in stages to reflect the
segments completed, but in no case shall the remaining bond be less than
fifteen percent (15%) of the cost of completing the entire improvements, all
upon approval by the board.
         (d)   (1) Upon completion of construction of all subdivision
improvements, the subdivider shall seek final acceptance of the improvements by
submitting written request for acceptance to the board.
            (2) If the board finds that all required improvements are completed
and in conformance with the requirements of this title and that all tests and
plans required to be submitted by the subdivider have been received and are
acceptable in accordance with the requirements of this title, the board shall
issue to the subdivider, written notice of the acceptance of the improvements
by the village.
            (3) Use of the improvements by the public or maintenance of the
improvements by any public entity, including, but not limited to, the village,
shall not constitute acceptance of any or all of the required improvements.

the township road district if the subdivision involves dedication of new
township streets or roadways, unless said roadways are the subject of an
annexation agreement with the village.
      12.   Maintenance, Bond:
         (a)   The subdivider shall maintain all subdivision improvements free
from defects for a period of two (2) years after the date the village engineer
issues a written notice of acceptance of all the subdivision improvements.
         (b)   If the village accepts part but not all of the subdivision
improvements, the part accepted must be maintained free of defects until the
expiration of the maintenance period for all subdivision improvements.
         (c)   A defect, as determined by the board with advice of its
engineer, for which the village may require repair is any:
            (1) Failure of a subdivision improvement to operate in conformance
with this title or construction plans, specifications or agreements during the
maintenance period; or
            (2) The appearance of any defect in a subdivision improvement which
is discovered during an inspection of the improvement made by village personnel
within a reasonable period of time after the subdivider's request for the
release of the maintenance bond or at any time prior to that inspection; or
            (3) The failure to design and construct a subdivision improvement
required by this title and not previously waived, the need for which is
discovered prior to the end of the maintenance period.
"Free from defects" means that all subdivision improvements are functioning in
accordance with the purpose for which they were designed and that the
improvements have not deteriorated other than to the extent of normal wear.
Nondesigned cracks on pavement or sidewalk shall not be considered normal wear.
         (d)   For a period of two (2) years after acceptance in writing of all
the subdivision improvements by the village engineer, the subdivider shall
maintain the subdivision improvements free from defects. The subdivider shall
promptly correct any defect of which the subdivider has notice or which the
village discovers, which defect occurs prior to the release of the maintenance
bond. The village engineer shall notify the subdivider of any defects
discovered by the village which occurred during this period and the subdivider
shall promptly remedy the same.
         (e)   Prior to acceptance of all completed subdivision improvements by
the board, the subdivider shall execute and provide a maintenance performance
bond in a form approved by the board, in the amount of fifteen percent (15%) of
the total cost of construction of all subdivision improvements. Said
maintenance bond shall guarantee all maintenance requirements provided in this
title. Surety on said maintenance bond shall be by one of the methods provided
in this title and shall run for a period of no less than the longer of twenty
seven (27) months or three (3) months after the request for release of the
bond.
         (f)   After expiration of the two (2) year maintenance period and
satisfactory completion of all maintenance work on subdivision improvements
required by this title, upon request of the subdivider and approval by the
board, the village shall release the subdivision maintenance performance bond
and its security in its entirety. The release of the bond and its security
shall be in writing on forms approved by the board.
      13.   Failure To Perform:
         (a)   Should the subdivider fail to perform the subdivider's
obligation to construct and maintain public improvements as required by this
title, the village may liquidate any performance security in the Village's
possession and use the proceeds to construct or maintain the improvements in
whole or in part as the Village in its sole discretion deems appropriate.
         (b)   Notwithstanding the amount of the subdivision improvement or
maintenance performance bond, the subdivider of the subdivision shall pay all
costs the Village actually incurs in designing and constructing improvements or
correcting defects in any improvements that the subdivider is required to
install and maintain pursuant to this title but which the subdivider fails to
design, construct or maintain free from defects in accordance with this title.
If the amount of money received by the Village from the subdivision improvement
performance bond or maintenance bond and its security is insufficient to pay
all such costs, the subdivider shall reimburse the Village for the remainder
within twenty eight (28) days of the date that the Village mails to the
subdivider a bill for the balance due.
Should the Village be required to institute proceedings in court or other
enforcement action in order to collect any sum due under this section or to
enforce the provisions of the subdivider's subdivision improvement or
maintenance performance bond or to collect on the security pledged in support
of said bonds, the Village shall be entitled to collect from the subdivider
reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred by the Village. (2005 Code)

utility companies and all public or quasi-public agencies affected by the
proposed subdivision. The mailing documents must indicate that written comments
be submitted to the Village of St. Joseph not later than thirty (30) days
thereafter, and that no comment in the time specified shall be deemed no
adverse comment.
      9.   Ten (10) copies of a sketch drawing depicting the location of any
existing buildings, structures or manmade features on the proposed minor
subdivision at a scale not less than one inch equals one hundred feet (1" =

benefit from the review and recommendations of the Planning and Zoning
Commission on a proposed minor subdivision, the Board may refer the application
and plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission to first make its review and
recommendation to the Board of Trustees. (Ord. 2011-7, 7-26-2011; amd. Ord.
2017-2, 3-28-2017, eff. 4-8-2017)
      13.   In the event the Board of Trustees determines that the land
involved in the proposed subdivision involves a subdivision into only two (2)
resulting lots, does not require a subdivision plat pursuant to the Illinois
"Plat Act", 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 205/1 et seq., will not negatively
impact surrounding property in a manner significantly different than if the
property were not subdivided, no other significant public interest is involved,
and that the resulting lots will be in conformance with applicable zoning
regulations, then the Board of Trustees may waive the requirements of this
title, or may waive said requirements subject to stated conditions. (Ord. 2011-
7, 7-26-2011)
