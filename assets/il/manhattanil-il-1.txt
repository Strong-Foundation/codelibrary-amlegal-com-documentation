gifts and to prohibited political activities. However, any amendment that makes
its provisions optional for adoption by municipalities shall not be
incorporated into this section by reference without formal action by the
corporate authorities of the village.
   I.   If the Illinois supreme court declares the act unconstitutional in its
entirety, then this section shall be repealed as of the date that the Illinois

INVESTMENT POLICY
SECTION:
1-15-1:    Scope
1-15-2: Objectives
1-15-3:    Standards Of Care
1-15-4:    Safekeeping And Custody
1-15-5:    Suitable And Authorized Investments
1-15-6:    Investment Parameters
1-15-7:    Reporting
1-15-8:    Policy Considerations
1-15-1: SCOPE:
   A.   This policy applies to the investment of funds for the Village. This
policy does not include investment of employees' investment retirement funds
and proceeds from bond issues, which are restricted by bond indentures. In the
event this policy conflicts with any federal or state laws or regulations,
including, but not limited to, the Public Funds Investment Act (30 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 235/2.5), the federal and state laws or regulations shall
apply. In all other events, this policy shall apply.
   B.   Pooling Of Funds: Except for cash in certain restricted and special
funds, the Village will consolidate cash balances from all funds to maximize
investment earnings. Investment income will be allocated to the various funds
based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principals. (Ord. 1304-19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-2: OBJECTIVES:
The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be
safety, liquidity, and yield:
   A.   Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment
program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the
preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to
mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
      1.   Credit Risk: The Village will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss
due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by:
         a.   Limiting investments to the safest types of securities;
         b.   Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, brokers/dealers,
intermediaries, and advisers with which the Village will do business; and
         c.   Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on
individual securities will be minimized.
      2.   Interest Rate Risk: The Village will minimize the risk that the
market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general
interest rates by:
         a.   Structuring the investment portfolio so that investments mature
to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to
redeem/sell investments prior to maturity; and
         b.   Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities,
money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools.
   B.   Liquidity: The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to
meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is
accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that investments mature concurrent
with cash needs to meet anticipated demand. A portion of the portfolio also may
be placed in money market funds or local government investment pools which
offer same-day liquidity for short-term funds.
   C.   Yield: The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of
attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles,
taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return
on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity
objectives described above. The core of investments is limited to relatively
low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the
risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the
following exceptions:
      1.   A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss
of principal;
      2.   A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration
in the portfolio; and/or
      3.   Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
(Ord. 1304-19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-3: STANDARDS OF CARE:
   A.   Prudence:
      1.   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be
the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing
and overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written
procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from exceptions are reported in a
timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in
accordance with the terms of this policy.
      2.   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   B.   Ethics And Conflicts Of Interest: Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and
investment officials shall disclose any material interest in financial
institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any
personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the
performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain
from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with
whom business is conducted on behalf of the Village.
   C.   Delegation Of Authority: Authority to manage the investment program is
granted to the Finance Director, hereinafter referred to as Investment Officer.
Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby delegated
to the Investment Officer, who shall act in accordance with established written
procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment program
consistent with this investment policy. Procedures should include references
to: safekeeping, investment accounting, repurchase agreements, wire transfer
agreements, and collateral/depositary agreements. No person may engage in an
investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and
the procedures established by the Investment Officer. The Investment Officer
shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a
system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. (Ord.
1304-19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-4: SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY:
   A.   Authorized Financial Dealers And Institutions:
      1.   A list will be maintained of financial institutions authorized to
provide investment services. In addition, a list also will be maintained of
approved security broker/dealers selected by creditworthiness.
      2.   All financial institutions and/or broker/dealers who desire to
become qualified for investment transactions must supply the following upon
request:
         a.   Most recent audited financial statements upon request;
         b.   Proof of National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)
certification;
         c.   Proof of state registration;
         d.   Certification of having read and understood and agreeing to
comply with the Village's investment policy; and
         e.   Proof of participation in the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.
      3.   A periodic review of financial condition and registration of
qualified financial institutions and broker/dealers may be conducted by the
Investment Officer.
   B.   Internal Controls:
      1.   The Investment Officer is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of
the Village are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. The internal control
structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these
objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that (i) the
cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (ii)
the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by
management.
      2.   Accordingly, the Investment Officer shall establish a process for an
annual independent review by an external auditor to assure compliance with
policies and procedures. The internal controls shall address the following
points:
         a.   Control of collusion;
         b.   Separation of transaction authority from accounting and
recordkeeping;
         c.   Custodial safekeeping;
         d.   Avoidance of physical delivery securities;
         e.   Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members; and
         f.   Written confirmation of transactions for investments and wire
transfers. (Ord. 1304-19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-5: SUITABLE AND AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS:
   A.   Investment Types:
      1.   The following investments will be permitted by this policy and are
those defined by state and local law where applicable:
         a.   U.S. government obligations, U.S. government agency obligations,
and U.S. government instrumentality obligations, which have a liquid market
with a readily determinable market value;
         b.   Certificates of deposit and other evidences of deposit at
financial institutions;
         c.   Investment-grade obligations of state, provincial and local
governments and public authorities;
         d.   Repurchase agreements whose underlying purchased securities
consist of the foregoing;
         e.   Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and whose portfolios consist only of dollar-denominated
securities; and
         f.   Local government investment pools, either state- administered or
through joint powers statutes and other intergovernmental agreement
legislation.
      2.   Investment in derivatives of the above instruments shall require
authorization by the Village of Manhattan Board of Trustees.
   B.   Collateralization:
      1.   Where allowed by state law, collateralization will be required on
two (2) types of investments: certificates of deposit and repurchase
agreements. In order to anticipate market changes and provide a level of
security for all funds, the collateralization level will be one hundred two
percent (102%) of market value of principal and accrued interest.
      2.   The Village will only accept the following as collateral:
         a.   U.S. government obligations;
         b.   U.S. government agency obligations;
         c.   U.S. government instrumentality obligations, which have a liquid
market with a readily determinable market value; and
         d.   Letters of credit issued by a federal home loan bank. (Ord. 1304-
19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-6: INVESTMENT PARAMETERS:
   A.   Diversification: The Village will diversify its investments by security
type and institution. With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities and local
government pools, no more than sixty five percent (65%) of the Village's total
investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type or with a
single financial institution.
   B.   Maximum Maturities:
      1.   To the extent possible, the Village shall attempt to match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. The Village will not
directly invest/deposit funds with a maturity date of more than four (4) years
from the date of purchase or in accordance with state and local statutes and
ordinances.
      2.   Because of inherent difficulties in accurately forecasting cash flow
requirements, a portion of the portfolio should be continuously invested in
readily available funds such as money market funds or overnight repurchase
agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained to meet ongoing
obligations. (Ord. 1304-19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-7: REPORTING:
Methods: The investment officer shall prepare an investment report monthly. The
report will include the following:
   A.   Listing of individual investments held at the end of the reporting
period;
   B.   Average weighted yield to maturity of investments in the portfolio;
   C.   Listing of investment by maturity date; and
   D.   Location of investment. (Ord. 1304-19, 10-1-2019)
1-15-8: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   Exception: Any investment currently held that does not meet the
guidelines of this policy shall be exempted from the requirements of this
policy. At maturity or liquidation, such monies shall be reinvested only as
provided by this policy.
   B.   Amendments: Any changes must be approved by the Village of Manhattan
Board of Trustees, as well as the individual(s) charged with maintaining
internal controls. (Ord. 1304-19, 10-1-2019)

1-18-4: Administration Of The Program
1-18-5: Identity Theft Prevention Elements
1-18-6: Program Management And Accountability
1-18-7: Other Legal Requirements
1-18-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this identity theft prevention program (program) is to protect
customers of the village's utility services from identity theft. The program is
intended to establish reasonable policies and procedures to facilitate the
detection, prevention and mitigation of identity theft in connection with the
opening of new covered accounts and activity on existing covered accounts.
(Res. 430-09, 1-6-2009, eff. 2-1-2009)
1-18-2: SCOPE:
This program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying
information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the
village and all employees. This program does not replace or repeal any
previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all of the
activities that are the subject of this program, but rather it is intended to
supplement any such existing policies and programs. (Res. 430-09, 1-6-2009,
eff. 2-1-2009)
1-18-3: DEFINITIONS:
When used in this program, the following terms have the meanings set forth
opposite their name, unless the context clearly requires that the term be given
a different meaning:
   COVERED ACCOUNT: An account that the village offers or maintains, primarily
for personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to
permit multiple payments of transactions (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(i)). A utility
account is a "covered account". The term "covered account" also includes other
accounts offered or maintained by the village for which there is a reasonably
foreseeable risk to the village or its customers from identity theft (16 CFR
681.2(b)(3)(ii)).
   IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, social security number, date of birth, official state or
government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number.
Additional examples of "identifying information" are set forth in 16 CFR
section 603.2(a).
   IDENTITY THEFT: A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority (16 CFR sections 681.2(b)(8)
and 603.2(a)).
   RED FLAG: A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the FTC's identity theft rules (16 CFR part 681) or the fair
credit reporting act of 1970 (15 USC section 1681 et seq.), as amended by the
fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 passed into law on December
4, 2003 (public law 108-159). (Res. 430-09, 1-6-2009, eff. 2-1-2009)
1-18-4: ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM:
The initial adoption and approval of the identity theft prevention program
shall be by resolution of the village board of trustees. Thereafter, changes to
the program of a day to day operational character and decisions relating to the
interpretation and implementation of the program may be made by the finance
director who shall be the program administrator. Major revisions of this policy
shall be approved by the village board of trustees.
Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the program will
be the responsibility of the program administrator. The program administrator
will report at least annually to the village board of trustees regarding
compliance with this program.
Issues to be addressed in the annual identity theft prevention report include:
   A.   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk
of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts and
activity with respect to existing covered accounts.
   B.   Service provider arrangements.
   C.   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's
response.
   D.   Recommendations for material changes to the program, if needed, for
improvement. (Res. 430-09, 1-6-2009, eff. 2-1-2009)
1-18-5: IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION ELEMENTS:
   A.   Identification Of Relevant Red Flags: The village has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the FTC's
identity theft rules and has reviewed the village's past history with instances
of identity theft, if any. The village hereby determines that the following are
the relevant red flags for purposes of this program given the relative size of
the village and the limited nature and scope of the services that the village
provides to its citizens:
      1.   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers.
         a.   A consumer reporting agency alerts the village of a credit
freeze, address disparity, or that an account has been noted to have abusive or
fraudulent activity.
      2.   The presentation of suspicious documents.
         a.   Documents provided for ID do not appear to be genuine and
unaltered.
         b.   The photo or physical description is not consistent with the
appearance of the applicant.
         c.   Information given to open the account is not consistent with the
ID of the applicant.
      3.   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
         a.   Personal ID is of the same type associated with fraudulent
activity: fictitious address, mailbox drop, or prison or phone number is
invalid; it is associated with a pager or answering service.
         b.   Personal ID provided is associated with known fraudulent
activity.
         c.   Personal ID is inconsistent with utility records.
         d.   The customer fails to provide all needed personal ID upon
request.
      4.   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
         a.   The utility is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions
in connection with a customer's account.
         b.   Customer notifies utility that they are not receiving their bill.
         c.   Mail sent to customer is repeatedly returned.
         d.   Payments are made in a manner associated with fraud. For example,
a deposit or initial payment is made and no payments are made thereafter.
      5.   Notice of possible identity theft.
         a.   Utility is notified by law enforcement officials or others, that
it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
   B.   Detection Of Red Flags: The employees of the village that interact
directly with customers on a day to day basis shall have the initial
responsibility for monitoring the information and documentation provided by the
customer and any third party service provider in connection with the opening of
new accounts and the modification of or access to existing accounts and the
detection of any red flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that
all employees who might be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of
a new account or with modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are
properly trained such that they have a working familiarity with the relevant
red flags identified in this program so as to be able to recognize any red
flags that might surface in connection with the transaction.
An employee who is not sufficiently trained to recognize the red flags
identified in this program shall not open a new account for any customer,
modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer with access to
information in an existing account without the direct supervision and specific
approval of a management employee. Management employees shall be properly
trained such that they can recognize the relevant red flags identified in this
program and exercise sound judgment in connection with the response to any
unresolved red flags that may present themselves in connection with the opening
of a new account or with modifying or accessing of an existing account.
Management employees shall be responsible for making the final decision on any
such unresolved red flags.
The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy
setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may apply for
service, the information and documentation to be provided by the prospective
customer in connection with an application for a new utility service account,
the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer with the
application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in which the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third party
service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally consistent
with the spirit of the customer identification program rules (31 CFR 103.121)
implementing section 326(a) of the USA PATRIOT act but need not be as detailed.
The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy
setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
   C.   Response To Detected Red Flags: If the responsible employees of the
village as set forth in the previous subsection are unable, after making a good
faith effort, to form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a
customer attempting to open a new account or modify or otherwise access an
existing account based on the information and documentation provided by the
customer and any third party service provider, the village shall not open the
new account or modify or otherwise provide access to the existing account as
the case may be. Opening new accounts or the modification or access to existing
accounts will be on a nondiscriminatory basis based on the village's policies.
The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy
setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an unresolved red flag
situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating factors that may
heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that
results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a notice that a
customer has provided account information to a fraudulent individual or
website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity theft when a red
flag is detected include:
      1.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
      2.   Contacting the customer.
      3.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices
that permit access to a covered account.
      4.   Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
      5.   Not opening a new covered account.
      6.   Closing an existing covered account.
      7.   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a
covered account to a debt collector.
      8.   Notifying law enforcement.
      9.   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances. (Res. 430-09, 1-6-2009, eff. 2-1-2009)
1-18-6: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY:
   A.   Initial Risk Assessment; Covered Accounts: Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the FTC's identity theft rules. Therefore,
the village determines that with respect to its residential utility accounts it
offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The village also performed an initial
risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or maintains any other
accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or the
utility from identity theft. In making this determination the village
considered: 1) the methods it uses to open its accounts, 2) the methods it uses
to access its accounts, and 3) its previous experience with identity theft, and
it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such other covered
accounts.
   B.   Program Updates; Risk Assessment: The program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
program update include:
      1.   An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
      2.   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures.
      3.   Changes in methods of identity theft.
      4.   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
      5.   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   C.   Training And Oversight: All staff and third party service providers
performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to
be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. (Res. 430-09, 1-6-
2009, eff. 2-1-2009)
1-18-7: OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS:
Awareness of the following related legal requirements should be maintained:
   A.   31 USC 5318(g) - Reporting of suspicious activities.
   B.   15 USC 1681 c-1(h) - Identity theft prevention; fraud alerts and active
duty alerts - limitations on use of information for credit extensions.
   C.   15 USC 1681 s-2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to
consumer reporting agencies.
   D.   15 USC 1681 m - Requirements on use of consumer reports. (Res. 430-09,

provision imposing a penalty for the violation of any section of the codes or
ordinances of the village.

which establishes a series of actions to be taken and/or fines to be paid which
will avoid suspension or revocation at that time.

whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and
property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction

extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross
charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel
termination point within this municipality and charges for the portion of the
interoffice channels provided within this municipality. Charges for that
portion of the interoffice channel connecting two (2) or more channel
termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional
boundary of this municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by
multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the interoffice channel by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points
that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of this municipality and
the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points
connected by the interoffice channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include
any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this chapter, 2) the tax imposed by the
telecommunications excise tax act, 3) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the

222.1 of the public utilities act to the extent of such exemption and during
the period of time specified by the department of commerce and economic

in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under
the Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax act has already been

corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries
represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of
profit for the corporation rendering such service.
   G.   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made).
   H.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication
devices.
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act.
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
   INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate
or terminate outside this state.
   INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.
   PERSON: Any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership,

subdivision of this state.
   PURCHASE AT RETAIL: The acquisition, consumption or use of
telecommunications through a sale at retail.
   RETAILER: Every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as

application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer
not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction
of the department, furnishes adequate security to ensure collection and payment
of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect
the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in
the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining
a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the
department at its discretion.
   RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE (Or Any Like Term):
Any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a
subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales

or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or
other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether
such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.
   SALE AT RETAIL: The transmitting, supplying or furnishing of
telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection
therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state
governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a
parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
   SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by this act.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS: In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to the word, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this chapter, "private line" means
a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end
telecommunications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges
for use of intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the
subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this chapter,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 1076, 12-21-2010)
2-9-3: PREVENTION OF MULTISTATE AND MULTIMUNICIPALITY TAXATION:
   A.   To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or privilege of
originating or receiving intrastate telecommunications by a person, any
taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality
on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or
authorized by this chapter to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due
and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other municipal tax.
   B.   To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation of the act or
privilege of originating or receiving interstate telecommunications by a
person, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another
state or municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a credit
against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this chapter to the extent
of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax
properly due and paid in a municipality in this state which was not previously
allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state.
   C.   The tax imposed under this chapter is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by
municipalities in this state. (Ord. 1076, 12-21-2010)
2-9-4: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Retailers filing tax returns pursuant to this chapter shall, at the
time of filing such return, pay to the department the amount of the tax
collected, less a discount of one percent (1%) which is allowed to reimburse
the retailer for the expenses incurred in keeping records, billing the
customer, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to
the department upon request. No discount may be claimed by a retailer on
returns not timely filed and for taxes not timely remitted.
   C.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 1076, 12-21-2010)
2-9-5: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
On or before August 31, 2011, and on or before the last day of every month
thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on telecommunication retails
shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required by the
department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax
act 1  and any accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to
implement the Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax act. (Ord.
1076, 12-21-2010)
 
Notes
1 1. 35 ILCS 636/5-50.
2-9-6: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for tax authorized by the
Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax act on any of such
purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may
reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided hereinabove in this chapter, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 1076, 12-21-2010)

upon which to protest the taxes at the time of payment or if the taxpayer paid
the taxes under duress.
   B.   The statute of limitations on a claim for credit or refund shall be

as applicable, related interest on the amount overpaid; provided, however, that
there shall be no refund and only a credit given in the event the taxpayer owes
any monies to the village.
      2.   Within ten (10) days of the receipt by the local tax administrator
of any claim for a refund or credit, the local tax administrator shall either:
         a.   Grant the claim; or
         b.   Deny the claim, in whole or in part, together with a statement as
to the reason for the denial or the partial grant and denial.
      3.   In the event the local tax administrator grants, in whole or in
part, a claim for refund or credit, the amount of the grant for refund or
credit shall bear interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, based on

(30) days after the originally designated audit and during normal business
hours.
   C.   The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit
conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven (7) days nor more
than thirty (30) days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer
and the local tax administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the
event the taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question,
the taxpayer may request another date within the thirty (30) days, approved in
writing, that is convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.
   D.   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's
business activities, including original source documents and books of entry
denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any
tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English
language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the village.

collection process.

of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the local tax
administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting forth the
basis of the taxpayer's request for a hearing. The written protest and petition
for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within forty five
(45) days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.

tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date

hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.

forty five (45) day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall

frame otherwise indicated.

assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be five
percent (5%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Penalty: If a tax return is not filed within the time and manner
provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing penalty of five
percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return shall
be imposed and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%) of the tax due shall
be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to five percent (5%) of the total tax due for the applicable
reporting period for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing
or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by
the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 741, 2-6-2001)
2-10-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local

2-10-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) days to
demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local
administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 741, 2-6-2001)

The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and

the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.

years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or after the
end of the calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was
filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 741, 2-6-2001)
2-10-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 741, 2-6-2001)

Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the

ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 741, 2-6-2001)
2-10-17: LIENS:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
741, 2-6-2001)

period for which it was due, those proceeds from raffle sales that were added
to the aggregate retail prize award amount during that ninety (90) shall no
longer be counted toward licensing fees due in successive ninety (90) day
periods.
            (5)   In the event a licensee fails to remit the full amount of its
licensing fee for a class 3 license within ten (10) business day following the
completion of any ninety (90) day period, the unpaid amounts shall become an

      6.   All streets, alleys, public ways, and railroad rights of way, if not
otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as
the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, public ways and
railroad rights of way. The centerline of a street, alley, public way or
railroad right of way, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be
deemed to be the district boundary.
      7.   Streets or alleys which are shown on the map and which have
heretofore been vacated, or which are vacated hereafter, shall be in the same
district as the land abutting both sides of the street or alley. If the land
abutting each side of the street or alley was located in different districts
before the street or alley was vacated, the centerline of the vacated street or
alley shall be the district boundary.
      8.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections A1 through A5 of this section, the zoning board of
appeals shall interpret the district boundaries.
   B.   Changes: If, by amendment to this title, any change is made in any
district boundary or in any other matter shown on the official zoning map, such
change shall be indicated on the map promptly after the amendment is adopted.
The date of the latest updating of the official zoning map shall be shown on
the face of the map. (Ord., 4-7-1970)
4-4-4: ENTIRE AREA ZONED:
It is the intent that the entire area of zoning jurisdiction, including all
land and water areas, rivers, streets, alleys, and railroad and other rights of
way, be included in the districts established by this title. If any area is not
shown on the official zoning map as being included in any district, it shall be
deemed to be in the R-1 single-family residence district. (Ord., 4-7-1970)
4-4-5: ANNEXED TERRITORY:
Any territory hereafter annexed shall, upon annexation, be automatically
classified in the ER estate residential district, until such territory is
reclassified in a manner provided by law. If within ninety (90) days after
annexation, no application for reclassification of the property has been filed,
the plan commission shall on its own motion schedule a public hearing on the
advisability of the zoning classification of the property and thereafter, if
needed, make recommendations for the reclassification of the property. This
section shall not apply to territory annexed with a valid preannexation
agreement adopted pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-15.1-1 et seq.

4-9-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of the planned unit development is to permit:
      1.   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public
by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other Chapters of this Title.
      2.   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities.
      3.   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features.

utilities, streets, and other facilities.
      6.   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals, and welfare.
   B.   The planned unit development is intended to provide for developments
incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and
developed as a unit. The planned unit development may provide amenities not
otherwise required by law and should establish facilities and open space
greater than the minimums required by law. Such development may consist of
conventionally subdivided lots or provide for development by a planned unit
development plat which establishes the location and extent of the features of
the planned unit development in keeping with the purpose of the plan. (Ord., 4-
7-70)
4-9-2: PROCEDURE:
A planned unit development shall be granted as a special use in accord with the
following procedures and may depart from the normal procedure, standards, and
other requirements of the other Chapters of this Title. Applications shall be
made on forms provided by the Village and shall be accompanied by the required
plats and documents. (Ord., 4-7-70)
4-9-2-1: PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE, CONFERENCE:
Prior to the filing of an application for approval of a planned unit
development, the developer may request of the Plan Commission an informal
meeting to discuss the development of their land in conjunction with the
Village Plan. Said meeting shall be a part of a regularly scheduled meeting,
shall be open to the public, and included on their agenda in advance of the
meeting.
The pre-application conference is not mandatory and does not require formal
application, fee, or filing of a planned unit development plat. (Ord., 4-7-70)
4-9-2-2: APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT:
A preliminary plat of the planned unit development shall be submitted to the
President and Board of Trustees, who shall refer same to the Plan Commission
for public hearing, report, and recommendation as to whether or not the
President and Board of Trustees should issue the special use permit applied
for. The required procedure for approval of the preliminary plat shall be:
   A.   Submission of the following:
      1.   Written application for approval of a planned unit development shall
be made on forms and in the manner prescribed by rules of the Village.
      2.   The application shall be accompanied by a fee which shall be
established by the President and Board of Trustees.
      3.   The preliminary plat and supporting data shall be in accord with the
stipulations of Section
4-9-4 of this Chapter.
   B.   The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application for
a planned unit development, giving notice of the time and place not more than
thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing by publishing a
notice thereof at least once in a newspaper published or having general
circulation within the Village.
   C.   Copies of the preliminary planned unit development plat and supporting
data shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals for their review and
recommendations. The report of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be made to the
Plan Commission within thirty (30) days and preceding the Plan Commission's
recommendation to the Village Board.
   D.   Copies of the preliminary planned unit development plat and supporting
data shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for certification as to
conformity with these regulations, recommendations, and suggestions regarding
the overall design, if any.
   E.   Following the public hearing and review of the preliminary planned unit
development plat and supporting data for conformity to these regulations, the
Plan Commission shall, within sixty (60) days, recommend approval,
modification, or disapproval, and the reasons therefor, to the President and
Village Board.
As a condition to the approval of the preliminary plat, the Plan Commission
shall set forth in a separate communication to the President and Board of
Trustees, findings of fact, in accord with Section
4-9-6 of this Chapter, on which they base their approval and describing how the
proposal meets the standards of Section
 4-9-5 of this Chapter.
   F.   The President and Board of Trustees after receipt of the preliminary
unit development plat from the Plan Commission, shall approve, modify, or
disapprove the preliminary plat. In the case of approval, or approval with
modification, the Village Board shall pass an ordinance granting the special
use and indicate their approval upon the plat, and arrange zoning map
modifications as necessary. The Village Board may require such special
conditions as they may deem necessary to insure conformance with the intent of
all Comprehensive Plan elements and the stated purposes of the planned
development.
   G.   Approval of a preliminary planned unit development plat shall not
constitute approval of the final plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression
of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the
preparation of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the
Village and subsequent recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of
these regulations and conditions of the preliminary approval, if any. The final
plat shall be approved as the final land use and zoning plat if it conforms
with the preliminary land use and zoning plat.
The preliminary and final plat may be filed and approved simultaneously or the
final plat may be filed and approved without a preliminary plat if all of the
land is to be developed at one time, and if all requirements hereof are met.
No building permit shall be issued for any structure until the approval of the
final plat. (Ord., 4-7-70)
4-9-2-3: APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT:
The final planned unit development plat shall conform substantially to the
preliminary plat as approved, and, if desired by the developer, it may be
submitted in stages with each stage reflecting the approved preliminary plat
which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided, however, that such
portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. The required
procedure for approval of a final plat shall be:
   A.   A final planned unit development plat and other supporting data
required for approval shall be submitted to the Plan Commission in accord with
the provisions of Section
4-9-4 of this Chapter.
The final plats must be submitted for approval in accordance with agreed to
scheduling, but not later than five (5) years from the approval of the
preliminary plat; in the event that same is not done, the Plan Commission shall

4-11-18: COMPREHENSIVE SIGN PLAN:
The purpose of a comprehensive sign plan is to provide for the establishment of
signage criteria that are tailored to a specific development or location, and
which may vary from specific ordinance provisions. The intent is to provide for
flexible sign criteria that promotes superior design through architectural
integration of the site, buildings and signs. A comprehensive sign plan shall
be granted as a special use in accordance with the following procedure,
standards and other requirements of the other chapters of this title:
   A.   The comprehensive sign plan shall include the location, size, height,
construction material and color, type of illumination and orientation of all
proposed signs, either permanent or temporary.
   B.   A comprehensive sign plan containing elements which exceed the
permitted height, area and number of signs specified in this chapter may be
permitted as a special use with a recommendation from the planning and zoning
commission and approval by the village board only upon a finding that:
      1.   The development site contains unique or unusual physical conditions,
such as topography, proportion, size or relation to a public street that would
limit or restrict normal sign visibility; or
      2.   The proposed or existing development exhibits unique characteristics
of land use, architectural style, site location, physical scale, historical
interest or other distinguishing features that represent a clear variation from
conventional development; or
      3.   The proposed signage incorporates special design features such as
logos, emblems, murals or statuaries that are integrated with the building
architecture; or
      4.   The proposed deviations from the standards of this chapter result in
a more unified sign package and greater aesthetic appeal between signs on the
site.
The construction and placement of individual signs contained in the approved
comprehensive sign plan shall be subject to the issuance of sign permits in
accordance with section
4-12-2-1 of this title.
   C.   The comprehensive sign plan review shall consider five (5) elements
that shall govern all signs within the development: location, materials, size,
color and illumination. The comprehensive sign plan application shall include
details, specifications, dimensions, and plans showing the proposed locations
of signs and how such signs conform to or vary from the requirements of this
chapter. It shall also show the computations of the maximum total sign area
permitted for the site as well as any special computations regarding additional
signs proposed.
   D.   The following may be included as part of a comprehensive sign plan and
shall be exempt from sign permits in accordance with section
4-12-2-1 of this title:
      1.   Signs, not to exceed twelve feet (12') in height and sixteen (16)
square feet in area, that direct pedestrians to major retailers or amenities
within a planned shopping center. Such signs shall not be visible from any
major arterial street and may be ground, wall or blade mounted. Such signs may
be illuminated.
      2.   Planned shopping center map sign, not to exceed eight feet (8') in
height and thirty two (32) square feet in area, that directs pedestrians to
multiple store locations within a planned shopping center. Such signs shall not
be visible from any major arterial street and may be illuminated.
      3.   Parking lot identification signs, not to exceed six (6) square feet
in area, located on light poles within the parking lot of a planned shopping
center, that direct automotive and pedestrian traffic to designated parking
areas. The lower limit of the face of any sign shall be a minimum height of
thirteen and one-half feet (13.5') and may be illuminated.
      4.   Any sign/banner/flag constructed of cloth, canvas or light fabric,
not to exceed ten (10) square feet in area, located on a light pole within the
retail area of a planned shopping center, which identifies a shopping district/
area. The lower limit of the face of any such sign shall be a minimum height of
nine feet (9'), shall not be visible from any major arterial street, and may be
illuminated.
      5.   Signs, not to exceed seven feet (7') in height and three (3) square
feet in area, that direct automobile traffic to locations that offer valet
parking services. Each business offering valet services shall be limited to two
(2) such signs. Such signs may be ground or wall mounted.
      6.   Signs, not to exceed three (3) square feet in area, located on light
poles within a planned shopping center, which identify the name of private
drive aisles within such planned shopping center. The lower limit of the face
of any such sign shall be a minimum height of nine feet (9'), shall not be
visible from any major arterial street, and may be illuminated.
      7.   Signs, not to exceed five (5) square feet in area, which identify
delivery service areas. Such signs may be ground or wall mounted and may be
illuminated.
      8.   Signs, not to exceed eight (8) square feet in area, that direct
pedestrians to restrooms, management offices, and other amenities within a
planned shopping center. The lower limit of the face of any such sign shall be
a minimum height of nine feet (9'), shall not be visible from any major
arterial street, and shall be wall mounted.
      9.   Electronic graphic display signs, provided that they shall only
display static images and be equipped with a regulator to automatically dim the
sign during periods of low light or darkness.
   E.   An applicant may request a change in an approved comprehensive sign
plan. A change in an approved comprehensive sign plan which results in a major
change shall require approval of the amendment by the village board of trustees
after recommendation on the matter by the village planning and zoning
commission. All major amendments shall follow the procedures and conditions
herein required for the original application submittal and review. A change
considered only a minor change shall require only the submission of a revised
plan to the village administrator or his/her designee for approval.
      1.   Guidelines for a major change:
         a.   A change in the original concept of the comprehensive sign plan.
         b.   An increase in the number of freestanding signs.
         c.   An increase in size of any freestanding sign exceeding ten

replacement sign must not exceed the area and height of the original
nonconforming sign. The restoration or repair must be started within a period
of thirty (30) days from the date of damage or destruction, and diligently
prosecuted to completion.
   B.   Whenever a nonconforming sign has been discontinued for a period of six
(6) consecutive months, or whenever there is evidently a clear intent on the
part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming sign, such sign shall not, after
being discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished, and the sign thereafter
shall be brought into conformity with the regulations of this chapter. Any such
discontinued sign shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent, or
person having the beneficial use of the structure upon which such sign may be
found within ten (10) days after written notification from the building
commissioner, and upon failure to comply with such notice within the time
specified in such order, the building commissioner may cause removal of such
sign, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the
property to which such sign is attached. (Ord. 1035, 10-6-2009)

treat the application as denied and may appeal from such denial to the Zoning
Board of Appeals in the manner and subject to the standards of Section
4-12-4 of this Chapter.
   D.   Period of Validity: No building permit shall be valid for a period
longer than one hundred eighty days (180) from the date of its issuance unless
the work authorized by it is substantially under way by the end of said period.
(Ord., 4-7-70)
4-12-2-2: CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
   A.   Certificate Required: It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof
hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or
enlarged in its use of structure until a certificate of occupancy shall have
been issued therefor by the Building Commissioner. No such certificate shall be
issued unless the proposed use or occupancy complies with all the provisions of
this Title. Any certificate of occupancy issued in conflict with the provisions
of this Title shall be void.
   B.   Application: Every application for a building permit shall also be
deemed an application for a certificate of occupancy. Where no building permit
is required, an application for a certificate of occupancy shall be made to the
Building Commissioner in such form as he may from time to time provide.
   C.   Issuance: No certificate of occupancy for a building, structure, or
portion thereof, constructed after the effective date hereof, shall be issued
until construction has been completed and the premises inspected and certified
to be in conformity with the plans and specifications upon which the zoning
certificate was based. Pending issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary
certificate may be issued, to be valid for a period not to exceed six (6)
months from its date, during the completion of any addition or during partial
occupancy of the premises. A certificate of occupancy shall be issued, or
written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a
certificate cannot be issued, not later than fifteen (15) days after the
Building Commissioner is notified in writing that the building or premises is
ready for occupancy.
   D.   Period of Validity: No certificate of occupancy shall be valid for a
period longer than ninety (90) days from the date of its issuance unless the
use or occupancy authorized by it shall have been established within such
period. (Ord., 4-7-70)
4-12-3: VARIATIONS:
   A.   Authority: In specific cases in which there are practical difficulties
or particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this Title, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power and
duty to determine and vary the applications of such regulations, in harmony
with their general purpose and intent, but only in accordance with the
requirements hereinafter set forth.
   B.   Application and Notice of Hearing: An application for a variation shall
be filed in duplicate with the Village Clerk, who shall forward a copy of the
application to the Board without delay. The application shall be in such form,

rule require. The Board shall hold a public hearing on such application not
more than sixty (60) days after its filing. Notice of the time and place of
such public hearing shall be published at least once. Not more than thirty (30)
days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village. The published notice may be supplemented by
such additional form of notice as the Board may provide by rule.
   C.   Standards:
      1.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not vary the provisions of this
Title as authorized in this Section, unless it shall have made findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in the following cases:
         a.   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;
         b.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; or
         c.   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
      2.   A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence in the judgment
of the Board of Appeals, sustains each of the three (3) conditions enumerated
above.
      3.   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Zoning
Board of Appeals, in making this determination whenever there are practical
difficulties or particular hardship, shall also take into consideration the
extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been
established by the evidence:
         a.   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved will bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out;
         b.   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoned
classification;
         c.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property;
         e.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or unduly injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
         f.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      4.   The Zoning Board of Appeals may require each conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in this Section to reduce or minimize the
effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to
implement the general purpose and intent of this Title. (Ord., 4-7-1970)
   D.   Authorized Variations: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide
variations from the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance that are in harmony
with its general purpose and intent, and shall only vary them in specific
instances where it has made a finding of facts based on the standards provided
in subsection C of this Section, and may be granted only in the following
instances, and in no others:
      1.   To permit any variations from the setback, lot coverage,
landscaping, lighting, screening, building height, general zoning provisions
listed in Chapter 3 of this Zoning Ordinance and IEPA regulations adopted by
reference in this Zoning Ordinance.
      2.   To permit the use of a lot or lots of record on the effective date
hereof for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or
width of the lot or lots, but in no event shall the respective area and width
of the lot or lots be less than ninety percent (90%) of the required area and
width.
      3.   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses, provided that substantial use of
such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week.
      4.   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by twenty percent (20%) of the applicable regulations.
      5.   To increase by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use
served.
      6.   To increase by not more than twenty percent (20%) the gross area of
a sign. (Ord. 700, 7-6-1999)
   E.   Effective Period: No order of the board granting a variation shall be
valid for a period longer than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of
such order unless a building permit is obtained within such period and the
erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within
such period. The board may grant one extension of this period, valid for no
more than one hundred eighty (180) additional days, upon written application,
and good cause shown, without notice of hearing. If any of the benefits
conferred by any variation, whether heretofore or hereafter granted, are
abandoned, or are not utilized for any continuous period of one year, said
variation shall, to the extent of such abandonment or nonutilization, become
void.
   F.   Decisions: Not more than sixty (60) days after the close of the public
hearing, the board shall make its findings of fact and its determination, in
writing, and shall forthwith transmit a copy thereof to the applicant. The
concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to grant a
variation. (Ord., 4-7-1970)

in any decision made by the building commissioner under this title, may be
taken to the board by any person or governmental agency aggrieved by such
decision or by any department, officer, board, or bureau of the village. Such
an appeal shall be taken, within such time as shall be prescribed by the board
by rule, by filing with the village clerk a notice of appeal in such form as
the board may provide by rule. The building commissioner shall, without delay,
forward to the board a copy of the notice of appeal together with all of the
papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made.
   C.   Stay Of Proceedings: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the decision appealed unless the building commissioner certifies
to the board, after the notice of the appeal has been filed with him, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceeding shall not be
stayed unless by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board or by a
court of record on application, on notice to the building commissioner and on
due cause shown.
   D.   Hearing: The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the
hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof to the parties, including the

may, upon the concurring vote of four (4) members, reverse, wholly or in part,
or modify, the decision of the building commissioner, as in its opinion ought
to be done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the building
commissioner. All decisions, after hearing, of the PZC on appeals from an
administrative order, requirement, decision or determination of the building
commissioner shall be an administrative determination and shall be subject to
further review by the village board.
   F.   Appeal Of PZC Decision: Within thirty (30) days after a written
decision of the PZC is transmitted to the applicant, the applicant may appeal
said decision to the village board. All decisions and findings of the village
board on appeals of a PZC shall in all instances be final administrative
decisions and shall be subject to judicial review as the law may provide. (Ord.
846, 2-15-2005)
4-12-5: SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
   A.   Purpose: This title is based upon the division of the village into
districts, within which the use of land, and the uses and bulk of buildings and
structures, are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, can only be
properly classified in any particular district or districts upon consideration
in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the
public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special
uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; and
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property, public facilities, or the Village as a whole.
   B.   Authority: Special use permits may be granted by the Village Board, but
only in accordance with the requirements hereinafter set forth.
   C.   Application and Notice of Hearing: An application for special use
permit shall be filed in duplicate with the Village Clerk, who shall forward a
copy of the application to the Plan Commission without delay. The application
shall be in such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such
plans, as the Plan Commission may by rule require. The Plan Commission shall
hold a public hearing on such application not more than sixty (60) days after
its filing. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at
least once, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days
before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village. the
published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the
Commission may provide by rule.
   D.   Report: Within sixty (60) days after the close of the hearing, unless
the applicant shall have consented to a longer period, the Commission shall
transmit to the Village Board a written report giving its findings and
recommendations for action to be taken by the Village Board on the application.
The report shall include any recommended conditions or restrictions to be
imposed upon the premises benefited by the special use permit.
   E.   Standards: No special use permit may be granted unless:
      1.   The proposed use is designated by this Title as a special use in the
district in which the use is to be located.
      2.   The proposed use will comply with all applicable regulations in the
district in which the use is to be located.
      3.   The location and size of the proposed use, the nature and intensity
of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, the size of
the site in relation to it, and the location of the site with respect to
streets giving access to it are such that it will be in harmony with the
appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is located.
      4.   The location, nature, and height of buildings, walls, and fences,
and the nature and extent of the landscaping on the site are such that the use
will not unreasonably hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use
of adjacent land and buildings.
      5.   Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use;
properly located, and suitably screened from adjoining uses, and the entrance
and exit drives will be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and
nuisances.
      6.   The proposed use will not cause substantial injury to the value of
other property in the neighborhood.
      7.   Conditions in the area have substantially changed and at least one
year has elapsed since any denial by the Village Board of any prior application
for a special use permit that would have authorized substantially the same use
of all or part of the site.
The Village Board shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefited by a special use permit as may be necessary to assure
compliance with the above standards, to reduce or minimize the effect of such
permit upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the
general intent of this Title. Failure to comply with such conditions or
restrictions shall constitute a violation of this Title.
   F.   Effective Period: No special use permit shall be valid for a period
longer than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date it is granted unless a
building permit or certificate of occupancy is obtained within such period and
the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced
within such period. The Board may grant one extension of this period, valid for
no more than one hundred eighty (180) additional days, upon written application
and good cause shown, without notice or hearing. If any special use is
abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, the special
use permit for such use shall become void, and such use shall not thereafter be
re-established unless a new special use permit is obtained.
   G.   Decisions: The Village Board, upon report of the Plan Commission and
without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed special use in
accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Illinois, or may refer it
back to the Plan Commission for further consideration.
   H.   Planned Unit Development: A planned unit development shall be granted a
special use. The standards, requirements, an procedures granted shall be in
accord with Chapter 9 of this Title. (Ord., 4-7-70)
4-12-6: AMENDMENTS:

      1.   An application for an amendment shall be filed with the Village
Clerk, and thereafter entered into the records of the first meeting thereafter
of the Village Board.
      2.   A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded by the
Village Clerk to the Zoning Board of Appeals with a request to hold a public

report of the Plan Commission, the application shall be deemed to have been
denied and shall not thereafter be granted,
In case a written protest against any proposed amendment signed and
acknowledged by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to be
altered, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately
adjoining, or by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly
opposite the frontage to be altered, is filed with the Village Clerk, the
amendment cannot be passed except on the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of
all members of the Village Board. (Ord., 4-7-70)
4-12-7: TEMPORARY PERMITS:
   A.   Authority: The Building Commissioner is authorized by this Title to
issue a temporary permit for uses specifically authorized in particular zoning
districts as temporary permit uses.
   B.   Application: An application for a temporary permit shall be made to the
Building Commissioner in writing on a form provided by the Village. The
Building Commissioner shall issue a permit only after he is satisfied that the
use allowed by the temporary permit will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare of the Village and/or immediate neighborhood.
   C.   Hearing: The Building Commissioner may, if he so desires, hold a public
hearing on the request for a temporary permit, or may contact the property

4-13-2: SHORT TITLE:
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the VILLAGE OF MANHATTAN
LOWLAND CONSERVANCY OVERLAY DISTRICT ORDINANCE. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
4-13-3: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the present and future residents of the Village and
downstream drainage areas by providing for the protection, preservation, proper
maintenance, and use of the Village watercourses, lakes, ponds, flood plain and
wetland areas. This Chapter is more specifically adopted:
   A.   To prevent flood damage by preserving storm and flood water storage
capacity;
   B.   To maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, flood plains,
ponds, lakes, wetlands, and ground water by storing and providing for
infiltration of wet-period runoff in flood plains and wetlands, and releasing
it slowly to the stream to maintain instream flow;
   C.   To manage storm water runoff and maintain natural runoff conveyance
systems, and minimize the need for major storm sewer construction and
drainageway modification;
   D.   To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments and
attached pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds before they drain into
streams or wetlands, and by maintaining the natural pollutant-assimilating
capabilities of streams, flood plains and wetlands;
   E.   To protect shorelines and stream banks from soil erosion, using natural
means and materials wherever possible;
   F.   To protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding grounds;
   G.   To protect wildlife habitat;
   H.   To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic, or scientific
interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species;
   I.   To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing areas;
and
   J.   To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of life of
the Village which depends in part on an adequate quality of water, a pleasing
natural environment, and recreational opportunities in proximity to the
Village.
In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this Chapter, the Village hereby
designates the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District which shall be considered
as an overlay to the zoning districts created by the Village zoning ordinances
as amended 1 . Any proposed development activity within the District must
obtain a special use permit as approved by the governing body of the Village 2
. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
 
Notes
1 1. See Section
  4-13-1  of this Chapter.
2 2. See Section
  4-13-5  of this Chapter.
4-13-4: DEFINITIONS:
   ARMORING: A form of channel modification which involves the placement of
materials (concrete, riprap, bulkheads, etc.) within a stream channel or along
a shoreline to protect property above streams, lakes and ponds from erosion and
wave damage caused by wave action and stream flow.
   BULKHEAD: A retaining wall that protects property along water.
   CHANNEL: A natural or artificial watercourse or perceptible extent that
periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a connecting
link between two (2) bodies of water. It has a definite bed and banks that
serve to contain the water.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION OR CHANNELIZATION: To alter a watercourse by changing
the physical dimension or materials of the channel. Channel modification
includes damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening,
straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody
vegetation. Channel modification does not include the clearing of debris or
trash from the watercourse. Channelization is a severe form of channel
modification involving a significant change in the channel cross section and
typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g., straightening).
   CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of storm water
runoff that passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and
downstream water surface elevation.
   CULVERT: A structure designed to carry drainage water or small streams below
barriers such as roads, driveways, or railway embankments.
   DEPRESSIONAL AREA: Any area which is lower in elevation on all sides than
surrounding properties (i.e., does not drain freely), or whose drainage is
severely limited such as by a restrictive culvert. A depressional area will
fill with water on occasion when runoff into it exceeds the rate of
infiltration into underlying soil or exceeds the discharge through its
controlled outlet. Large depressional areas may provide significant storm water
or flood plain storage.
   DEVELOPMENT: The carrying out of any building, agricultural, or mining
operation, or the making of any change in the use or appearance of land, and
the dividing of land into two (2) or more parcels. The following activities or
uses shall be taken, for the purposes of this Chapter, to involve "development"
as defined herein:
   A.   Any construction, reconstruction, or alteration of a structure to
occupy more or less ground area, or the on-site preparation for same;
   B.   Any change in the intensity of use of land, such as an increase in the
number of dwelling units on land, or a material increase in the site coverage
of businesses, manufacturing establishments, offices, and dwelling units,
including mobile homes, campers, and recreational vehicles, on land;
   C.   Any agricultural use of land including, but not limited to, the use of
land in horticulture, floriculture, forestry, dairy, livestock, poultry,
beekeeping, pisciculture, and all forms of farm products and farm production;
   D.   The commencement of drilling, except to obtain soil samples, or the
commencement of mining, filling, excavation, dredging, grading or other
alterations of the topography;
   E.   Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site;
   F.   Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction for agricultural,
private residential, commercial or industrial use;
   G.   Deposit of refuse, solid or liquid waste, or fill on a parcel of land,
or the storage of materials;
   H.   Construction, excavation, or fill operations relating to the creation
or modification of any road, street, parking facility or any drainage canal, or
to the installation of utilities or any other grading activity that alters the
existing topography;
   I.   Construction or erection of dams, levees, walls, fences, bridges or
culverts; and
   J.   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity
of flood or surface waters.
   DISTRICT: The "Lowland Conservancy Overlay District" as defined in
subsection
4-13-6-1 of this Chapter.
   EROSION: The general process whereby soils are moved by flowing water or
wave action.
   FILTERED VIEW: The maintenance or establishment of woody vegetation of
sufficient density to screen developments from a stream or wetland, to provide
for streambank stabilization and erosion control, to serve as an aid to
infiltration of surface runoff, and to provide cover to shade the water. The
vegetation need not be so dense as to completely block the view. Filtered view
means no clear cutting.
   FLOOD PLAIN: That land adjacent to a body of water with ground surface
elevations at or below the 100-year frequency flood elevation.
   FLOODWAY: That portion of the flood plain (sometimes referred to as the base
flood plain or special flood hazard area) required to store and convey the base
flood. The floodway is the 100-year floodway as designated and regulated by the
Illinois Department of Transportation/Division of Water Resources. The
remainder of the flood plain which is outside the regulatory floodway is
referred to as the flood fringe or floodway fringe.
   HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS: The features of a watercourse which determine its
water conveyance capacity. These features include, but are not limited to: size
and configuration of the cross section of the watercourse and floodway; texture
and roughness of materials along the watercourse; alignment of watercourse;
gradient of watercourse; amount and type of vegetation within the watercourse;
and size, configuration, and other characteristics of structures within the
watercourse. In low-lying areas the characteristics of the overbank area also
determine water conveyance capacity.
   LAKE OR POND: Any inland waterbody, fed by spring or surface water flow.
   LOT: An area of land, with defined boundaries, that is designated in
official assessor's records as being one parcel.
   NATURAL (In Reference To Watercourses): Those stream channels, grassed
waterways and swales formed by the existing surface topography of the earth
prior to changes made by unnatural causes. A natural stream tends to follow a
meandering path; its flood plain is not constrained by levees; the area near
the bank has not been cleared, mowed or cultivated; the stream flows over soil
and geologic materials typical of the area with no alteration of the course or
cross section of the stream caused by filling or excavating.
   ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK (OHWM): The point on the bank or shore, up to which
the presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave a
distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristics.
   QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL: A person trained in one or more of the disciplines
of biology, geology, soil science, engineering, or hydrology whose training and
experience ensure a competent analysis and assessment of stream, lake, pond and
wetland conditions and impacts.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER: A professional engineer registered under
the provisions of "The Illinois Professional Engineering Act" and any act
amendatory thereof.
   RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A facility that provides for storage of storm
water runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or
storm.
   RUNOFF: The portion of precipitation on the land that is not absorbed by the
soil or plant material and which runs off the land.
   SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris, and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in water bodies or watercourses.
   SETBACK: The horizontal distance between any portion of a structure or any
development activity and the ordinary high- water mark of a perennial or
intermittent stream, the ordinary high-water mark of a lake or pond, or the
edge of a wetland, measured from the structure's or development's closest point
to the ordinary high-water mark, or edge.
   STREAM: A body of running water flowing continuously or intermittently in a
channel on or below the surface of the ground. 7.5 minute topographic maps of
the U.S. Geological Survey are one reference for identifying perennial and
intermittent streams. For purposes of this Chapter, the term "stream" does not
include storm sewers.
   STRUCTURE: Anything that is constructed, erected or moved to or from any
premises which is located above, on, or below the ground including, but not
limited to, tents, camper trailers, and recreation vehicles are not considered
structures when used less than one hundred eighty (180) days per year and
located landward of the minimum setback provided as a natural vegetation strip.
   VEGETATION: All plant growth, especially trees, shrubs, mosses, and grasses.
   WATERCOURSE: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, slough, gulch, draw, ditch, channel, conduit, culvert,
swale, grass waterway, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway,
which has a definite channel, bed and banks, in or into which storm water
runoff and flood water flow either regularly or intermittently.
   WETLAND: Those transitional lands between terrestrial and aquatic system
where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered
by shallow water. Classification of areas as wetlands shall follow the
Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States as
published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS/OBS-79/31). (Ord. 642, 12-
3-1996)
4-13-5: SPECIAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Request For Permit: To ensure that proposed development activity can be
carried out in a manner which is compatible and harmonious with the natural
amenities of the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and with surrounding land
uses, a request for a special use permit for such development activity must be
submitted for approval by the governing body of the Village.
No special use permit shall be issued unless the Village finds that:
      1.   The development will not detrimentally affect or destroy natural
features such as ponds, streams, wetlands, and forested areas, nor impair their
natural functions, but will preserve and incorporate such features into the
development's site;
      2.   The location of natural features and the site's topography have been
considered in the designing and siting of all physical improvements;
      3.   Adequate assurances have been received that the clearing of the site
of topsoil, trees, and other natural features will not occur before the
commencement of building operations; only those areas approved for the
placement of physical improvements may be cleared;
      4.   The development will not reduce the natural retention storage
capacity of any watercourse, nor increase the magnitude and volume of flooding
at other locations; and that in addition, the development will not increase
stream velocities; and
      5.   The soil and subsoil conditions are suitable for excavation and site
preparation, and the drainage is designed to prevent erosion and
environmentally deleterious surface runoff.
There shall be no development, including the immediate or future clearing or
removal of natural ground cover and/or trees, within the Lowland Conservancy
Overlay District for any purpose, unless a special use permit is granted
subject to the provisions of this Chapter or the provisions of the Village
Zoning Ordinance.
Dumping, filling, mining, excavating, dredging, or transferring of any earth
material within the District is prohibited unless a special use permit is
granted.
No ponds or impoundments shall be created nor other alterations or improvements
shall be allowed in the District for recreational uses, storm water management,
flood control, agricultural uses or as scenic features unless a special use
permit is granted.
   B.   Application For Permit: Application for a special use permit shall be
made by the owner of the property, or his/her authorized agent, to the Village
on a form furnished for that purpose. Each application shall bear the name(s)
and address(es) of the owner or developer of the site and of any consulting
firm retained by the applicant together with the name of the applicant's
principal contact at such firm. Each application shall include certification
that any land clearing, construction, or development involving the movement of
earth shall be in accordance with the plans approved upon issuance of the
permit.
   C.   Submissions: Each application for a special use permit shall be
accompanied by the following information as specified in the Chapter sections

acres in area the corporate authority, upon recommendation of the Village
Engineer, may waive or simplify any or all of the submission requirements 1
provided that the person responsible for any such development shall implement
necessary protection measures to satisfy the purpose and intent set forth in
Section
 4-13-3 of this Chapter 2 .
   D.   Bonds: The applicant may be required to file with the Village a
faithful performance bond or bonds, letter of credit, or other improvement
security satisfactory to the Village Attorney, in an amount deemed sufficient
by the Village to cover all costs of improvements, landscaping, for such period
as specified by the Village, and engineering and inspection costs to cover the
cost of failure or repair of improvements installed on the site.
   E.   Review And Approval: Each application for a special use permit shall be
reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures:
      1.   The Village will review each application for a special use permit to
determine its conformance with the provisions of this Chapter. The Village may
also refer any application to any other local government or public agency
within whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comments. Within
sixty (60) days after receiving an application, the Village shall in writing:
a) approve the permit application, if it is found to be in conformance with the
provisions of this Chapter, and issue the permit; b) approve the permit
application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure
substantially the objectives of this Chapter, and issue the permit subject to
these conditions; or c) disapprove the permit application, indicating the
deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or
submission.
      2.   No special use permit shall be issued for an intended development
site unless:
         a.   The development, including, but not limited to, subdivisions and
planned unit developments, has been approved by the Village where applicable;
or
         b.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the Village; or
         c.   The proposed development is coordinated with any overall
development program previously approved by the Village for the area in which
the site is situated.
      3.   Failure of the Village to act on an original or revised application
within thirty (30) days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in
accordance with the plans as filed, unless such time is extended by agreement
between the Village and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a
revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance
with conditions established by the Village.
   F.   Permit Exceptions: The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to:
      1.   Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property; when
emergency work is performed under this Section, the person performing it shall
report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the corporate authority
within ten (10) days after commencement of the work and shall thereafter obtain
a special use permit and shall perform such work as may be determined by the
agency to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment to the watercourse,
lake, pond, flood plain or wetland 3 ;
      2.   Work consisting of the operation, repair, or maintenance of any
lawful use of land existing on the date of adoption of this Chapter;
      3.   Lands adjacent to farm ditches if:
         a.   Such lands are not adjacent to a natural stream or river; or
         b.   Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were
not streams before ditching; or
         c.   Such lands are maintained in agricultural uses without buildings
and structures.
Where farm ditches are found to contribute to adverse environmental impacts or
hazards to persons or property, the Village may include designated farm ditches
in the District. The Village may also require that linings, bulkheads, dikes
and culverts be removed to mitigate hazards, or that other mitigative measures
be taken, such as the maintenance of a natural vegetation buffer strip.
   G.   Effect On Other Permits: The granting of a special use permit under the
provisions herein shall in no way affect the owner's responsibility to obtain
the approval required by any other statute, ordinance, or regulation of any
state agency or subdivision thereof, or to meet other Village ordinances and
regulations. Where State and/or Federal permits are required, a special use
permit will not be issued until they are obtained. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)

4-13-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS; AREA AFFECTED:
This Chapter applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds and
wetlands within the Village. Streams, lakes, and ponds (including intermittent
streams) are those which are shown on the United States Department of the
Interior Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle maps and those
additional streams, lakes, and ponds delineated on maps adopted as part of this
Chapter. Those maps are hereby made a part of this Chapter, and two (2) copies
thereof shall remain on file in the office of the Village Administrator for
public inspection. Within the jurisdiction of the Village, those waterbodies
and watercourses that are named and are subject to the provisions of this
Chapter are Wilson Creek, Prairie Creek and Jackson Creek. Wetlands are those
designated in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Illinois Department of
Conservation wetland inventory and those additional wetlands delineated on maps
adopted as part of this Chapter.
If new drainage courses, lakes, ponds or wetlands are created as part of a
development, the requirements for setbacks and uses within setbacks, and the
criteria for watercourse relocation and minor modification shall apply. The
District shall be amended as appropriate to include these areas. (Ord. 642, 12-
3-1996)
4-13-6-1: LOWLAND CONSERVANCY OVERLAY DISTRICT:
The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District shall be considered as an overlay to
the zoning districts created by the Village Zoning Ordinance as amended. In
addition to the requirements of this Chapter, applicants for a special use
permit within the District shall meet all requirements of the underlying zoning
districts. In the event of a conflict between the overlay district requirements
and the underlying zoning district requirements, the most restrictive
requirements prevail. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
4-13-6-2: DISTRICT BOUNDARY:
The procedures, standards and requirements contained in this Chapter shall
apply to all lots within wetlands and streams, and all lots lying wholly or in
part:
   A.   Within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); or
   B.   Within one hundred feet (100') of the ordinary high-water mark (OHWM)
of a perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high-water mark of a
lake or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or
   C.   Within depressional areas serving as flood plain or storm water storage
areas, as designated on the Lowland Conservancy District Map.
The District is designated on a map labeled "Lowland Conservancy Overlay
District Map", which is made to be part of this Chapter and which has the same
force and effect as if all the notations, references, and descriptions shown
thereon were set forth or described herein. Designated areas are attached as
Exhibit "B" 1  and additional areas may be approved from time to time and be
made exhibits hereto. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
 
Notes
1 1. Exhibit "B" is on file in the Village Clerk's office.
4-13-6-3: MINIMUM SETBACK OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY:
   A.   Absolutely no development activity (except as provided below) may occur
within the minimum setback which is defined as one hundred feet (100') from the
ordinary high-water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, or the edge of wetlands,
or within a designated depressional area. In no case shall the setback be less
than the boundary of the 100-year floodway as defined by FEMA. These setback
requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken
out of the culvert as part of development activity. If a culvert functions as a
low-flow culvert, where water is intended to periodically flow over it, the
setback requirements apply.
   B.   The following development activities may be permitted, subject to
issuance of a special use permit, within the minimum setback areas only if, as
a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the setback area. Such
development activities will only be approved based upon a report, prepared by a
qualified professional, which demonstrates that they will not adversely affect
water quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant habitat area; adversely
affect drainage and/or storm water retention capabilities; adversely affect
flood conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth conditions, create erosion
hazards, or be materially detrimental to any other property in the area of the
subject property or to the Village as a whole, including the loss of open space
or scenic vistas:
      1.   Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations,
informational displays, directional signs, foot bridges, observation decks, and
docks;
      2.   The maintenance, repair, replacement, and reconstruction of existing
highways and bridges, electrical transmission and telecommunications lines,
poles, and towers; and
      3.   The establishment and development of public and private parks and
recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic natural and scientific
areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and
animal farms, wildlife preserves and public boat launching ramps.
   C.   Review of the proposed development activity within the minimum setback
area will consider the following:
      1.   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the development of
public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park
shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and maintenance of
roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for permitted uses
are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate location
outside of the setback area is available.
      2.   Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be
permitted for the development of storm water drainage swales between the
developed area of the site (including a storm water detention facility on the
site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetland. Detention basins within the
setback are generally discouraged, unless it can be shown that resultant
modifications will not impair water quality, habitat, or flood storage
functions.
      3.   No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to
install piers for the limited development or walkways and observation decks.
Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and
should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois Natural
Areas Inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species.
      4.   Wetland area occupied by the development of decks and walkways must
be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement.
      5.   Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of storm water
management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved and total
wetland acreage is preserved. Where such modification is permitted, wetlands
shall be protected from the effects of increased storm water runoff by measures
such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer strips,
and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. The direct
entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided.
   D.   Environmental impact analysis of wetland modification may be required
in accordance with Section
4-13-8 of this Chapter.
   E.   An applicant for a special use permit 1  must stabilize areas left
exposed after land surface modification with vegetation normally associated
with that stream or wetland. The planting of native riparian vegetation is
recommended as the preferred stabilization measure. Other techniques should be
used only when and where vegetation fails to control erosion. The preferred
alternative is riprap, using natural rock materials where practicable,
installed on eroding bank areas in a manner that provides interstitial space
for vegetative growth and habitat for macroinvertebrates and other stream
organisms. Linings of the stream channel bottom is not permitted.
   F.   The applicant shall minimize access to the applicant's proposed
development activity within all or part of the Lowland Conservancy Overlay
District where such access could adversely affect the stream, lake, pond,
wetland, or related environmentally sensitive areas. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
 
Notes
1 1. See Section
  4-13-5 of this Chapter.
4-13-6-4: SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
   A.   A site development plan must be prepared for any proposed development
within, or partly within, the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and must
indicate:
      1.   Dimension and area of parcel, showing also the vicinity of the site
in sufficient detail to enable easy location, in the field, of the site for
which the special use permit is sought, and including the boundary line,
underlying zoning, a legend, a scale, and a north arrow. (This requirement may
be satisfied by the submission of a separate vicinity map.);
      2.   Location of any existing and proposed structures;
      3.   Location of existing or proposed on-site sewage systems or private
water supply systems;
      4.   Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond, and
its ordinary high-water mark;
      5.   Location and landward limit of all wetlands;
      6.   Location of setback lines as defined in this Chapter;
      7.   Location of the 100-year floodway;
      8.   Location of existing or future access roads;
      9.   Specifications and dimensions of stream, wetland or other water
areas proposed for alterations;
      10.   Cross sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood
storage volumes; and
      11.   Such other information as reasonably requested by (local government
name).
   B.   The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified
professional, that demonstrates that the proposed development activity will not
endanger health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or diversion
of flood flow. The developer shall also show, by submitting appropriate
calculations and resource inventories, that the proposed development activity
will not substantially reduce natural flood water storage capacity, destroy
valuable habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna, adversely affect water
quality or ground water resources, increase storm water runoff velocity so that
water levels on other lands are substantially raised or the danger from
flooding increased, or adversely impact any other natural stream, flood plain,
or wetland functions, and is otherwise consistent with the intent of this
Chapter. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
4-13-6-5: GEOLOGIC AND SOIL CHARACTERISTICS; REPORT:
The site proposed for development shall be investigated to determine the soil
and geologic characteristics, including soil erosion potential. A report,
prepared by a licensed professional engineer, geoscientist, or soil scientist
experienced in the practice of geologic and soil mechanics, shall be submitted
with every application for land development within the Lowland Conservancy
Overlay District. This report shall include a description of soil type and
stability of surface and subsurface conditions. Any area which the
investigation indicates as being subject to geologic or soil hazards shall not
be subjected to development, unless the engineer or soil scientist can
demonstrate conclusively that these hazards can be overcome. (Ord. 642, 12-3-
1996)
4-13-6-6: HYDROLOGIC CONTROLS; DRAINAGE CONTROL PLAN:
A drainage control plan that describes the hydraulic characteristics of on-site
and nearby watercourses as well as the proposed drainage plan, prepared by a
registered professional engineer experienced in hydrology and hydraulics, shall
be submitted with each application for land development within the Lowland
Conservancy Overlay District. Unless otherwise noted, the following
restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to all development within
the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District:
   A.   Natural open channel drainageways shall be preserved; and
   B.   Runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g., roofs,
driveways, streets, patios, etc.) shall be collected and transported to a
drainageway (preferably a natural drainageway) with sufficient capacity to
accept the discharge without undue erosion or detrimental impact. Vegetated
drainage swales, are preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or
other manufactured materials.
The drainage control plan shall identify appropriate measures, such as recharge
basins and detention/retention basins, which will limit the quantitative and
qualitative effects of storm water runoff to predevelopment conditions. (Ord.
642, 12-3-1996)
4-13-6-7: SITE GRADING AND EXCAVATION PLAN:
This Section applies to the extent that grading and excavation and erosion
control plans, which satisfy the following requirements, are not already
required by a jurisdiction.
   A.   A site grading and excavation plan, prepared by a registered
professional engineer, trained and experienced in civil engineering, shall be
submitted with each application for a special use permit and shall include the
following:
      1.   Details of the existing terrain and drainage pattern with one foot
(1') contours;
      2.   Proposed site contours at one foot (1') intervals;
      3.   Dimensions, elevation and contours of grading, excavation and fill;
      4.   A description of methods to be employed in disposing of soil and
other material that is removed from allowable grading and excavation sites,
including location of the disposal site if on the property;
      5.   A schedule showing when each stage of the project will be completed,
including the total area of soil surface to be disturbed during each stage, and
estimated starting and completion dates. The schedule shall be prepared so as
to limit, to the shortest possible period, the time soil is exposed and
unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed,
removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to initiation of the
improvements; and
      6.   A detailed description of the revegetation and stabilization methods
to be employed, to be prepared in conjunction with the landscape plan per
Section
4-13-6-8 of this Chapter. This description should include locations of erosion
control measures such as sedimentation basins, straw bales, diversion swales,
etc.
The grading and excavation plan must be consistent with all the provisions of
this Chapter.
   B.   Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, the following restrictions,
requirements and standards shall apply to all development within the District:
      1.   Every effort shall be made to develop the site in such a manner so
as to minimize the alteration of the natural topography;
      2.   No grading, filling, cleaning, clearing, terracing or excavation of
any kind shall be initiated until final engineering plans are approved and the
special use permit is granted by the Village; and
      3.   The depositing of any excavation, grading or clearing material
within a stream, lake, pond or wetland area (i.e., within the District) shall
be prohibited.
In addition to locating all site improvements on the subject property to
minimize adverse impacts on the stream, lake, pond, or wetland, the applicant
shall install a berm, curb, or other physical barrier during construction, and
following completion of the project, where necessary, to prevent direct runoff
and erosion from any modified land surface into a stream, lake, pond, or
wetland. All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be located as far as
possible from a stream, lake, pond, or wetland.
   C.   The Village may limit development activity in or near a stream, lake,
pond, or wetland to specific months, and to a maximum number of continuous days
or hours, in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the Village may require
that equipment be operated from only one side of a stream, lake, or pond in
order to minimize bank disruption. Other development techniques, conditions,
and restrictions may be required in order to minimize adverse impacts on
streams, lakes, ponds or wetlands, and on any related areas not subject to
development activity. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
4-13-6-8: NATURAL VEGETATION STRIP REQUIRED; LANDSCAPE PLAN:
   A.   To minimize erosion, stabilize the streambank, protect water quality,
maintain water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and wildlife
habitat, to screen manmade structures, and also to preserve aesthetic values of
the natural watercourse and wetland areas, a natural vegetation strip shall be
maintained along with edge of the stream, lake, pond, or wetland. The natural
vegetation strip shall extend landward a minimum of twenty five feet (25') from
the ordinary high-water mark of a perennial or intermittent stream, lake or
pond and the edge of a wetland.
Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may be selectively pruned
or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a filtered view of
the waterbody from the principal structure and for reasonable private access to
the stream, lake, pond, or wetland. Said pruning and removal activities shall
ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for streambank
stabilization and erosion control.
   B.   A landscape plan, prepared by a professional landscape architect, shall
be submitted with each special use permit application for development activity
within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and contain the following:
      1.   A plan describing the existing vegetative cover of the property and
showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part of the
proposed construction; and
      2.   A plan describing the proposed revegetation of disturbed areas
specifying the materials to be used.
The vegetation must be planned in such a way that access for stream maintenance
purposes shall not be prevented. (Ord. 642, 12-3-1996)
4-13-7: WATERCOURSE RELOCATION AND MINOR MODIFICATIONS:
   A.   Relocations And Modifications Through Special Use Permit: Watercourse
relocation or modification is generally not permitted because these activities
are not usually consistent with the purposes of this Chapter. Under certain
circumstances, relocation and minor modification may be permitted through a
special use permit where certain problems can be mitigated by relocation and/or
minor modification, specifically when:
      1.   Off-site hydrologic conditions are causing erosion, flooding and
related problems; or
      2.   On-site soil and geologic conditions are resulting in unstable
conditions that pose hazards to life, health, and existing structures or
property; or
      3.   The quality of previously modified or relocated streams can be
improved through restoration; or
      4.   Officially adopted storm water management plans call for placement
of detention or retention facilities in a stream; or
      5.   Public utilities, including sanitary sewers, pipelines, and roadways
require stream crossing or relocation where there are not practical
alternatives.
Modification or watercourses as a convenience for site design purposes is not
permitted.
   B.   Conditions And Restrictions For Permitting Stream Modification: Stream
modification, when permitted, is subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:
      1.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be
significantly improved by the modification; no significant habitat area may be
destroyed;
      2.   The amount of flow and velocity of a stream is not to be increased
or decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject property, unless this
reflects an improvement over previous conditions in terms of reduced flooding,
reduced erosion, or enhanced low-flow conditions;
      3.   Prior to diverting water into a new channel, a qualified
professional approved by the Village shall inspect the stream modification, and
issue a written report to the Village that the modified stream complies with
the requirements in subsection C of this Section; and
      4.   Stream channel enlargement, or other modifications that would
increase conveyance, shall not be permitted if the intended purpose is to
accommodate development activities in the flood plain.
   C.   Required Content: Stream relocation may be permitted in accordance with
a stream relocation plan which provides for:
      1.   The creation of a natural meander pattern, pools, riffles, and
substrate;
      2.   The formation of gentle side slopes (at least 3 feet horizontally
per 1 foot vertically), including installation of erosion control features;
      3.   The utilization of natural materials wherever possible;
      4.   The planting of vegetation normally associated with streams,
including primarily native riparian vegetation;
      5.   The creation of spawning and nesting areas wherever appropriate;
      6.   The reestablishment of the fish population wherever appropriate;

phases;
      10.   Plans for sediment and erosion control; and
      11.   Establishment of a low-flow channel which reflects the conditions
of a natural stream.
   D.   Criteria For Permitting Armoring Of Channels And Banks: Armoring in the
form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or devices is not permitted except
in accordance with the following:
      1.   Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way and the use
of vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the
shoreline or bank;
      2.   The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland, or
between a wetland and a lake or pond;
      3.   The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the transmittal
of wave energy or currents to other properties; and
      4.   The change in the horizontal or vertical configuration of the land
must be kept to a minimum.
Where permission to install bulkheads or other armoring devices is requested as
part of the special use permit application, documentation and certification
pertaining to the items above must be submitted.
   E.   Criteria For The Use Of Culverts: Culverts are not permitted in streams
except in accordance with the following:
      1.   Where a culvert is necessary for creating access to a property; use
of culverts as a convenience, in order to facilitate general site design, is
not to be considered;
      2.   The culvert must allow passage of fish inhabiting the stream, and
accommodate the 100-year flood event without increasing upstream flooding,
except where a restricting culvert is desirable as part of an overall storm and
flood water management plan;
      3.   The culvert must be maintained free of debris and sediment to allow
free passage of water, and if applicable, fish; and
      4.   The stream bottom should not be significantly widened for the
placement of a culvert as this increases siltation; if multiple culverts must
be installed, one culvert should be at the level of the bottom of the stream
and the others at or above normal water elevation.
   F.   Criteria For On-Stream Impoundments: Impoundment of streams is not
permitted except in accordance with the following:
      1.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing regional storm water detention, flood control, or public recreation;
      2.   The impoundment will not prevent the upstream migration of
indigenous fish species;
      3.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants;
      4.   Impoundments without permanent low-flow pools are preferred except
where a permanent pool is necessary to achieve the intended benefits of the
impoundment (e.g., recreation or water quality mitigation); and

facilities in order to minimize the proliferation of antenna-supporting
structures. The Village may grant access to Municipal property (water tower,
rights of way, etc.) and/or lower permit fees to applicants locating as a
second or more user on a single tower or other location. In order to be
eligible for a separate personal wireless service facility, the applicant
shall:
   A.   Supply documentation showing the proposed antenna cannot be
accommodated on an existing or permitted tower or building within a quarter
mile of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
      1.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost;
      2.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building,
as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
      3.   Existing or approved towers and buildings within a quarter mile
cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function
reasonably, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer; or
      4.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building.
   B.   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service facility
shall be designed structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to
accommodate both the applicant's antenna(s) and compatible antenna(s) for at
least two (2) additional antennas if the tower is over eighty feet (80') in
height or for at least three (3) additional antennas if the tower is over one
hundred feet (100') in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future
rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at
varying heights. (Ord. 709, 10-5-1999)
4-15-8: SIGNS:
The use of any portion of a personal wireless service facility tower for signs
other than warning or equipment information is prohibited. Signs used for
warnings or equipment information shall be no larger than as are required by
FCC regulations. (Ord. 709, 10-5-1999)
4-15-9: COMPLIANCE:
All personal wireless service facilities must maintain compliance with the
approved plans and specifications. If the personal wireless service facility
becomes noncompliant with the approved plans and specifications due to, but not
limited to: discoloration, cracking, missing components, rusting, settling,
damage or general disrepair, or failure to maintain the required landscaping,
berming and/or screening; then the owners of the personal wireless service
facility and the owner of the building or lot on which the personal wireless
service facility is located will be jointly and severally responsible for
remedying the specific nonconformities. These nonconformities must be remedied
within forty five (45) days after written notice, detailing these
nonconformities, is sent by the Village to the owner of the personal wireless
service facility and the owner of the building or lot. Failure to remedy all of
the cited nonconformities, within the forty five (45) day time period, shall be
punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day that
the violation continues. (Ord. 709, 10-5-1999)
4-15-10: ABANDONED OR UNUSED FACILITIES:
Abandoned or unused facilities, towers, or portions of towers shall be removed
as follows:
   A.   Facilities which cease operations shall notify the FCC and Village
within ten (10) days of ceasing operations. Such facilities shall be removed
within three (3) months of notifying the FCC and Village of intent to cease
operations at the site unless a time extension is approved by the corporate
authorities. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease which requires
the applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon cessation of
operations at the site shall be submitted at the time of application. In the

The title of this title shall be SUBDIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS FOR
THE VILLAGE OF MANHATTAN, WILL COUNTY, ILLINOIS. The provisions of chapters 1,

the necessary protection against deterioration and obsolescence which would
adversely affect the living environment or tax base.

relationship between the village and the developer and to safeguard the
interests of the homeowner, the subdivider, the investor and the village.

effective operating range of existing public utilities and improvements.
   E.   Cause the cost of design and installation of improvements in new,
platted subdivisions to be borne by the persons purchasing the lots rather than
be any direct or indirect burden upon existing property owners beyond the
limits of the subdivision who have already paid for the improvements servicing
their property.
   F.   Bring about compact development of both homes and public improvements
without the delay often experienced through future use of special assessment
methods.
   G.   Coordinate new subdivision design with the design of the village as a
whole to allow for the proper capacity of all types of improvements on the
basis of an orderly sequence of subdivisions as a part of neighborhoods and
neighborhoods as a part of the community.

waters.

5-1-10: VARIATIONS:
   A.   Where the planning and zoning commission finds that extraordinary
hardship or practical difficulties may result from the strict compliance with
these regulations, it may recommend variances to these regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of these regulations and further provided that the planning and zoning
commission shall not recommend variances unless it shall make findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out;
      4.   The variances will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
zoning ordinance, comprehensive plan, official map or any other village
ordinance.
   B.   In recommending variances, the planning and zoning commission shall
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations.

regulations controlling subdivisions, such resubdivision shall be approved by
the plan commission and corporate authorities by the same procedure, rules and
regulations for a subdivision.
   B.   Procedure For Subdivision Where Future Resubdivision Is Indicated:
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the plan
commission or corporate authorities may require that such parcel of land allow
for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent

commission and corporate authorities in like manner as plats of subdivisions.
The corporate authorities may reject any such instrument which abridges or
destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets or
alleys.
   C.   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded or filed, in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly
recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alleys, and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.
   D.   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein
provided by all the owners in such plat joining in the execution of such
writing. (Ord. 946, 3-20-2007)

However, for property outside the corporate limits of the village, no such
agreement shall be required where the applicant has entered into a similar
agreement covering the parcel with the county authorities.
         a.   Acceptable Improvement Completion Guarantees:
            (1)   Letter Of Credit: An irrevocable commercial letter of credit
with any financial institution which must be approved by the village attorney
and subdivision administrator and which provides for administration of such
credit. The letter of credit shall be in an acceptable form as prescribed by
the corporate authorities. This is the village preferred method.
            (2)   Completion Bond: A completion bond to ensure the construction
of the improvements in a satisfactory manner and within the period specified by
the corporate authorities. The bond shall be payable to the village and be in a
form with surety and conditions as approved by the village attorney and

         b.   Amount Of Guarantee: The amount of the completion guarantee shall
be based on the following:
            (1)   Total cost of the estimated construction, engineering,
surveying and fees for each specific phase of the required improvements plus
fifteen percent (15%) of such total for contingencies, and maintenance of
improvements and the abatement of construction nuisance and erosion control
during the period prior to acceptance of improvements, all as approved by the
subdivision administrator.
         c.   Guarantee Itemized Separately:
            (1)   Each improvement completion guarantee shall be separately
itemized by phases as follows:
               (A)   Step 0; mass grading improvements: Mass grading for public
right of way and detention ponds, detention pond stabilization, erosion
control, and detention pond "as built" drawings and storage volume
calculations;
               (B)   Step 1; underground improvements: Storm sewers, sanitary
sewers, water mains, and "as built" drawings of same;
               (C)   Step 2; basic roadway improvements: Curb and gutter,
roadway base course, roadway binder course, bike trails, street name and
traffic control signs, and streetlights;
               (D)   Step 3; finished roadway improvements: Final surface
course;
               (E)   Step 4; parkway improvements: Sidewalks, parkway trees,
and parkway restoration;
               (F)   Miscellaneous off site improvements: Off site roadway
improvements, off site storm sewer improvements, off site sanitary sewer
improvements, off site water main improvements, etc. A separate completion
guarantee will be required for each off site improvement.
            (2)   If the balance of work remaining uncompleted in any specific
step equals five percent (5%) or less, as determined by the public improvement
coordinator or village engineer, of the original amount of the completion
guarantee as specified in subsection D1b of this section, the village may
approve reductions in the guarantee to an amount equal to twenty percent (20%)
of the original amount of the completion guarantee. The village shall not under
any circumstances reduce a completion guarantee if the work remaining in that
step exceeds five percent (5%). The village shall not accept any portion of the
improvements in a step until the step has been one hundred percent (100%)
completed. The village shall approve one hundred percent (100%) reductions in
the guarantee only after all of the improvements in each specific step as
itemized have been completed and demonstrated by "as built" engineering plans
(only for steps 0 and 1) provided by the developer and signed and stamped by a
professional engineer registered in the state of Illinois (see section
5-7-2 of this title). The reduction shall be by written resolution or letter of
the corporate authorities. The resolution/letter completely eliminating the
guarantee shall also include acceptance of the public improvements of the
specific step simultaneously upon reduction of a guarantee for the specific
step of the improvements. A maintenance guarantee as then provided by this
title shall be submitted to the village (including all off site improvements
individually).
            (3)   All guarantees shall be for two and one-half (21/2) years (30
months) from the date of issuance of said guarantee.
            (4)   Step 0 improvements (mass grading improvements) will not be
accepted by the village (i.e., release of completion guarantee) until the
village has approved that the individual lots have been graded within
substantial compliance with the approved development plans. (Ord. 946, 3-20-
2007)
            (5)   Until such time that the step 3 improvements (final surface
course for roadways) have been formally accepted by the village, the applicant
shall be responsible for any damage to step 1, step 2 or step 3 improvements
caused by the village's snow removal operations. (Ord. 1004, 8-19-2008)
            (6)   Step 3 improvements (final surface course for roadways)
cannot be initiated until a minimum of twelve (12) months from the time the
road improvements for step 2 (curb and gutter, roadway base course, and roadway
binder course) have been completed or until such time that at least eighty
percent (80%) of the phase or unit is built out; whichever time period is
longer, but not to exceed thirty (30) months (scheduling of final surface
course to be coordinated with public improvement coordinator and village
engineer). In this interim time, bituminous binder course "fillets" will be
used to fill the gap between the top of the binder course and the gutter flag
per the village standard details. At such time that the surface course is ready
to be paved, the additional binder thickness at the edge of the pavement will
be removed by a conventional cold milling operation. Any structural pavement or
curb and gutter defects will be remedied and the entire binder course will be
primed with a bituminous material before the surface course is constructed.
      2.   A maintenance guarantee to be furnished upon final completion of
improvements for each step as prescribed under subsection D1c of this section
and prior to acceptance in a form as prescribed under subsection D1a of this
section effective for a period of two (2) years (24 months) after the final
acceptance of said improvements for the purpose of:
         a.   Guaranteeing against and securing the correction of any defect in
material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character,
and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the
village.
         b.   Guaranteeing against and securing the correction of any damage to
improvements by reason of settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
Such maintenance guarantee shall also provide that as such defects develop, the
amount held thereunder may be applied by the village for any amounts incurred
to correct such defects, and that the balance of such deposit, if any, held at
the end of such two (2) year period shall be released by the village to the
depositor without interest. The amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be
not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total initial amount of the
completion guarantee.
   E.   Upon the determination that the application and final plat or final
site plan are in proper form, the planning and zoning commission shall place
the matter on its agenda and shall serve notice upon the applicant of the time
and place of the meeting at which the matter will be discussed. The village
engineer shall also be notified and supplied with copies of the application,
final plat or final site plan and other documents.
   F.   The applicant may elect to have final approval of a geographic part or
parts of the plat that received preliminary approval, and may delay application
for approval of other parts until a later date or dates beyond one year with
the approval of the corporate authorities; provided, all facilities required to
serve the part or parts for which final approval is sought have been provided.
In such case only such part or parts of the plat as have received final
approval shall be recorded.
   G.   If the applicant so elects, he may delay furnishing the guarantees
required by subsection D of this section until notified that the final plat has
been approved by the corporate authorities in all other respects; provided that
the signature of the president and the clerk and the seal of the village not be
affixed to the plat until the required guarantees are furnished and approved.
   H.   The planning and zoning commission shall forward its written report to
the corporate authorities recommending approval or disapproval of the final
plat or final site plan within fifteen (15) days from the date of its regular
or special meeting next following the filing of the last required document or
other paper which shall be considered the date of filing the application for
final approval of the plat or site plan. The signatures of the chairman and
secretary of the planning and zoning commission shall be affixed to the final
plat or final site plan after approval by the corporate authorities. If the
recommendation is to disapprove, the report shall set forth the reasons for its
disapproval and specify with particularity the aspects in which the proposed
plat or site plan fails to meet the standards of section
 5-2-4 of this chapter. A copy of the report shall also be forwarded to the
applicant.
   I.   After receiving the final recommendation of the planning and zoning
commission, the corporate authorities, by resolution, shall approve or
disapprove the final plat or site plan within sixty (60) days from the date of
filing application for final approval of the plat or site plan unless the
applicant and the corporate authorities mutually agree to extend this sixty
(60) day period. If the final plat or final site plan is disapproved, the
resolution shall state the reasons for the disapproval, specifying with
particularity the aspects in which the final plat or final site plan fails to
meet the standards of section
5-2-4 of this chapter. A copy of the resolution shall be furnished to the
applicant.
   J.   A certified copy of the resolution approving or disapproving the final
plat or final site plan shall be filed in the office of the village clerk
attached to said final plat or final site plan. The final subdivision site plan
plat together with all covenants and restrictions shall be recorded by the
village clerk or village designee in the office of the recorder of deeds for
the county in which the property is located and returned to the village clerk
or village designee. All recording fees shall be prepaid by the applicant. The
village clerk shall notify the building commissioner of the recording of the
final plat or final site plan. (Ord. 946, 3-20-2007)
5-2-4: STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF PLATS AND SITE PLANS:
   A.   The planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval and the
corporate authorities shall approve a preliminary or final plat or a
preliminary or final site plan unless it makes written findings specifying the
manner in which:
      1.   The design and layout of the subdivision site plan or development
does not conform to the provisions of this title.
      2.   The applicant has not made adequate provision to install
improvements required by the planning and zoning commission or corporate
authorities under authority of this title.
      3.   The final plat of subdivision or final site plan fails to comply
with an approved preliminary plat of subdivision site plan or preliminary site
plan.
      4.   The plat or site plan does not conform with this chapter, the
comprehensive plan, the official map, the flood control ordinance of the
village, village ordinances, or established planning policies of the village.
      5.   The provisions for vehicular loading, unloading, parking or
circulation on the parcel or onto adjacent public rights of way will create
hazards to safety or will cause significant burdens on transportation
facilities that could be avoided by modification of the plan.
      6.   The vehicular and pedestrian traffic circulation system creates
hazards to safety which could be avoided by modification of the plan.
      7.   The proposed plan unnecessarily and in specified particulars
destroys, damages, or detrimentally alters significant natural, topographic or
physical features of the site and development.
      8.   The proposed landscaping, screening or lighting fails to provide
adequate acoustical or visual privacy to incompatible adjacent uses which could
be avoided by modification of the plan.
      9.   The bulk and location of proposed buildings and structures will have
significant adverse impact on adjacent property and development of the parcel
is not feasible in a manner that will avoid these consequences.
      10.   The proposed plat or site plan makes inadequate provision for the
use and maintenance of open space and this failure may result in a burden on
the public or on the adjacent properties.
      11.   The proposed development will impose an undue burden upon off site
public services, including sanitary sewer, water and storm drainage, which
conclusion shall be based upon a written report of the village engineer
provided that there is no provision in the capital works program of the village
to correct the specific burden and that the applicant has not agreed to
alleviate that portion of the burden attributable to the proposed development.
      12.   The subdivision site plan or development is subject to periodic
flooding or contains poor drainage facilities and would make adequate drainage
of the lots and streets impossible.

100,000.01 to 500,000.00        2,875.00 plus 2.5 percent of amount over
                                $100,000.00
500,000.01 and over             12,875.00 plus 1.5 percent of amount over
                                $500,000.00
 
The engineering review fees shall be paid upon submittal of the preliminary
plan. Should the actual infrastructure improvement costs be unavailable at the
time of submittal of the preliminary plan, the owner, subdivider or developer
shall submit, as a viable substitute, an engineer's opinion of probable
construction costs for the proposed public improvements. The village engineer
shall review the sufficiency of the tendered improvement costs and either: 1)
approve them as submitted, or 2) require that they be revised and resubmitted.
Improvement costs, actual or estimated, as approved by the village engineer,
shall be utilized as the basis for calculating the engineering review fees.
Such fees, if based upon estimated amounts, shall be eligible for adjustment
based upon actual costs in accordance with the infrastructure improvement costs
amount when finally determined. Any additional engineering review fees required
due to upward revisions in the infrastructure improvement costs shall be paid
prior to final plan approval. If the final infrastructure improvement costs
amount is less than the initial estimate as submitted by the owner, subdivider
or developer, the initial estimate shall be utilized unless the difference
between the initial estimate and the final infrastructure improvement costs
amount is greater than twenty five percent (25%), in which case the village
shall refund that amount of the difference in excess of twenty five percent
(25%).
"Infrastructure" shall be defined as all public improvements located in rights
of way or easements as defined by this title along with detention/compensatory
storage areas and any private improvements that are necessary to service access
to multiple units in the development, such as shared common driveways and
private roadways. Improvements beyond the right of way required to service an
individual lot will not be included.
         b.   Multiphased developments which contemplate or which may otherwise
require the construction and/or dedication of public improvements and which
would require phased engineering review of the final plan submittals shall be
submitted to the village for review by the village engineer. The engineering
review fees shall be paid as follows:
            (1)   Twenty percent (20%) of the engineering review fee, as
determined by applying the fee table set forth in subsection A3a of this
section to the infrastructure improvement costs for all phases of the
subdivision or development, shall be paid upon submittal of the preliminary
plan.
            (2)   Subsequently, as each phase of the multiphased development is
submitted for final plan approval, a percentage of the total engineering review
fee shall be due and paid prior to final plan approval for that phase. The
amount due for each phase shall be calculated by applying the percentage of
infrastructure improvements proposed for that phase (infrastructure improvement
cost for phase divided by infrastructure improvement costs for all phases) to
the engineering review fees remaining after deducting fees provided in
subsection A3b(1) of this section.
Example: Infrastructure improvement costs amount for public $1,000,000.00
improvements for entire (all phases) development
Total review fee                                            20,375.00
Calculated as follows:
Initial fee (20 percent)                                    4,075.00
Phase I final review fee $500,000.00 (50 percent)           8,150.00
Phase II final review fee $250,000.00                       4,075.00
Phase III final review fee $250,000.00                      4,075.00
                                                            $ 20,375.00
 
      4.   Construction Observation Fees: The public improvement coordinator
and the village engineer, or their representatives, shall observe the
construction of the public improvements or utilities for single and multiphased
developments that contemplate the construction and/or dedication of public
improvements. The fee for the construction observation services shall be
determined based upon the cost of public improvements required by the village
and approved by the village engineer, as set forth in the following fee table:
 
Infrastructure Improvement Cost Fee
$50,000.00 or less              $1,000.00 minimum
Over $50,000.00                 $1,000.00 plus 1.5 percent of amount over
                                $50,000.00
 
The above construction observation fees shall be paid prior to final plat
approval.
      5.   Development Not Including Public Improvements And Redevelopment
Projects: For developments and subdivisions that do not contemplate the
construction and/or dedication of public improvements, review and construction
observation fees shall be charged to the owner, subdivider or developer as
follows:
         a.   Administrative fees shall be charged in amounts and in the same
manner as set forth in subsection A1 of this section.
         b.   Engineering review and construction observation fees shall be
charged at the hourly rate specified by the village and in effect at the time
such fees are charged. When performed by a consultant acting as village
engineer the hourly fee for this work shall be as provided in the consultant
engineering contract between the village and the village engineer. When
performed by village personnel the hourly fee shall be as established by the
village.
         c.   A base fee shall be charged and will be used by the village to
cover the initial cost for this work. The base fee shall be in the amount of
three hundred dollars ($300.00) per gross acre, with a minimum fee of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00), which amount shall be adjusted by the village
when the project is approved. The base fee shall be paid prior to approval of
the site or development plan.
         d.   Any deficiency in the engineering review or construction
observation fees shall be due and payable by the owner, subdivider or developer
within thirty (30) days of written notice of said deficiency by the village.
(Ord. 946, 3-20-2007)
   B.   Plat Fees: A fee shall be paid to the village clerk at the time of
submission of the preliminary and final plat. No plat shall be reviewed by the
planning and zoning commission without a receipt from the village clerk being
exhibited by the owner, subdivider or developer showing full payment of the
fee. Payment of the fee is in no way contingent on whether or not the plat of
subdivision or development submitted is approved or disapproved. The fee shall
be as follows:
Preliminary plat: Twenty five dollars ($25.00) per lot within each preliminary
subdivision or development plat submitted with a minimum fee of two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00).
Final plat: Fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each lot within each final subdivision
or development plat submitted with a minimum fee of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00).
In the event that a plat calls for development of residential property, either
as two-family or multiple-family, or as business or industrial property, then
the fee shall be determined as ten dollars ($10.00) per each dwelling unit or
ten dollars ($10.00) per acre for businesses or industrial property. (Ord.
1029, 6-2-2009)

the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient, safe access to property.
      4.   The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily
be adhered to and the use of curvilinear streets shall be encouraged where such
use will result in a more desirable layout. The use of cul-de-sacs and U-shaped
streets is not encouraged.
      5.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
parcel to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the planning and zoning commission,
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision site plan with the existing layout or the most advantageous
future development of adjacent parcels.
      6.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various

be completed within two (2) years of final plat approval, the corporate
authorities may, upon application, grant extensions for up to six (6) months
for such sidewalk completion. No more than four (4) such extensions may be
granted. No extension shall be granted unless or until the applicant's
(developer's) subdivision security bond or letter of credit has been extended
to remain valid during the term of any such extension. Nothing herein contained
shall be deemed a waiver of the applicant's (developer's) responsibility to
complete the sidewalks, and provided further that if the applicant (developer)
transfers ownership of any lot the sidewalk of which has not been accepted by
the village, the applicant (developer) and the owner of the lot shall be
jointly and severally responsible for the completion and maintenance of the
sidewalk.

5-6-1: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES; FEES IN LIEU THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of
planned unit development, each subdivider, developer, builder or owner will be
required to:
   A.   Dedicate land for school sites to serve the immediate and future needs
of the residents of the development;
   B.   Make cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedication; or
   C.   A combination of both, at the option of the village upon recommendation
of the school districts affected in accordance with the following criteria and
formula set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-2: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION:
   A.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be
generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon
the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land
dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining a ratio of: 1)
estimated children to be served in each school classification over the 2)
maximum recommended number of students to be served in each school
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the 3) minimum
recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school
classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land
deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated
increase of children in each such school classification. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998,
eff. 5-1-1998)
   B.   School Classification And Size Of School Site: School classifications
and size of school sites within or serving the village shall be determined in
accordance with the following criteria:
 
School Classification By  Maximum Number Of Students Minimum Number Of Acres Of
Grades                    For Each Such School       Land For Each School Site
                          Classification             Of Such Classification
Elementary schools,
grades kindergarten       600 students               17 acres
through 5th (K - 5)
Junior high schools,
grades 6th through 8th (6 900 students               34 acres
- 8)
High schools, grades 9th  1,500 students             45 acres
through 12th (9 - 12)
 
(Ord. 801, 3-2-2004)
   C.   Location: The location of the site to be dedicated shall be determined
by the village board of trustees upon recommendation of the board of education
of the school district having or to have jurisdiction of the school to be
erected on the site taking into account the comprehensive school plan and/or
the standards adopted by the affected school district as a guideline in
locating sites. The village board of trustees shall not select the site without
allowing opportunity for the board of education of the school district affected
to make a recommendation with respect thereto. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-
1998)
5-6-3: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF SCHOOL SITES:
   A.   Requirement, Use Of Contributions: Where the development is "small" as
used herein, and the resulting size of the land contribution is too small to be
practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, and it
is determined by the village after recommendation by the affected school
district not to require the dedication of land, the village shall require the
subdivider, developer, builder or owner to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
the land dedication required. In considering whether a development is "small"
as used herein, the village may consider whether the total number of the
proposed dwelling units will produce less than the maximum number of students
for one school of each school classification in accordance with this chapter.
The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be paid to the village
prior to the issuance of building permits. The village shall turn over any and
all dollars actually collected for such fees to the appropriate school district
semiannually. (Ord. 1203, 8-4-2015)
Such contributions shall be used solely for the acquisition of land for a
school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that
subdivision or development or for the improvement to any existing school sites
and buildings which serve such needs. Improvement under this section shall be
liberally construed and shall include, but shall not be limited to, the
development of parking lots; sidewalks; traffic signals; arterial streets;
collector streets; internal roadways; connection with sewer, water and
electrical lines; playgrounds; recreation grounds; and athletic fields.
Improvement shall also include the purchase of any material, goods or equipment
necessary to said development and construction. Improvement shall further
include the construction of buildings; additions to existing school buildings;
remodeled or renovated noninstructional spaces in classrooms and the purchase
of prefabricated classroom units to be used at a school site, and bond payments
related to these eligible expenditures. Annual operational expenditures are not
an eligible expenditure of these contributions. (Ord. 801, 3-2-2004)
   B.   Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as school sites. It
has been determined that the present "fair market value" of such improved land
in and surrounding the village is thirty five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) per
acre, and such figure shall be used in making calculations for school
contributions unless the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of a planned
unit development files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such
objection, the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of the planned unit
development shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such
improved land in the area of his subdivision or planned unit development or
other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair market value" per
acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board based upon such
information submitted by the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of the
planned unit development and from other sources which may be submitted to the
village board by the school districts or others.

   lv = $35,000.00 (estimated value of fully developed acre of land)
Based on 2000 Ehlers And Associates population generated figures
(Ord. 1203, 8-4-2015)
   C.   Criteria For Requiring Land Dedication And A Contribution: There will
be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination
of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
      1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision or
planned unit development falling within the school location shall be dedicated
as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be
required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated.
      2.   A major part of the school site has already been acquired and only a
small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The
remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in
lieu thereof shall also be required to fulfill the obligations of that
development. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-4: DENSITY FORMULA:
The table of estimated ultimate population density is generally indicative of
current and short range projected trends in family size for newly constructed
residential units as determined by Ehlers And Associates and shall be used in
calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash
contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by
the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of the subdivision or planned unit
development. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998; amd. Ord. 901, 4-18-2006)

(Res. 642, 8-4-2015, eff. 11-1-2015)
In the event a subdivider, developer, builder or owner of a subdivision or
planned unit development or school district files a written objection to the
table of estimated ultimate population listed herein, they shall submit their
own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be
generated from the subdivision or planned unit development, and in that event
final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations
shall be made by the village board. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-5: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND:
Nothing herein contained shall limit the authority of the village to require
the designation and reservation of school sites or other public lands as a
condition to approval of any plat of subdivision or planned unit development
where such land is to be acquired by condemnation within one year from final
plat approval as set forth under division 12, article 11 of the Illinois
municipal code. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-6: COMBINATION WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENT:
Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than forty (40)
acres, a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be
combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions or planned unit
developments in order to produce usable school sites without hardship on a
particular subdivider, developer, builder or owner of a planned unit
development. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-7: TOPOGRAPHY AND SOILS:
   A.   Regulations: School sites must possess suitable topography and soil
sites for the use to which they are dedicated. The subdivider shall provide the
school district with current soil analysis tests from a minimum of one soil
boring per acre to a minimum depth of fifteen feet (15'). At the request of the
school district, the required number of soil borings may be concentrated in an
area in anticipation of assessing soil conditions for a proposed building pad.
The subdivider shall also provide the school district with a phase I
environmental study which shall consist of a site assessment and environmental
audit which covers the ownership and known uses of the property described and
any improvements and facilities (including equipment) thereon for the past one
hundred (100) years and addresses the current uses of the property and its
compliance with environmental laws including, without limitations, all
appropriate inquiries into the previous ownership and uses of the land
consistent with good commercial and prudent engineering practices in an effort
to minimize liability for hazardous materials. Any hazardous materials or
underground storage tanks found on the site shall be removed by the subdivider
prior to dedication.
   B.   Frontage: School sites shall have, at a minimum, adequate frontage
along a publicly dedicated street to allow convenient access. Generally, thirty
feet (30') of frontage will be provided for every acre of land that is
dedicated; provided, however, that the minimum acceptable frontage for any site
will be one hundred fifty feet (150'). (Ord. 901, 4-18-2006)
5-6-8: IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED FOR LAND DEDICATIONS:
School sites to be dedicated by a subdivider shall include the following land
improvements prior to dedication:
   A.   Grading: Each dedicated site shall be graded to drain storm and surface
water at a minimum of two percent (2%) for open areas; and slopes on berms,
when berms are required, shall not exceed four to one (4:1). Grading shall
include, but not be limited to: berms for separation and screening from
adjoining properties; placement of six inches (6") of topsoil and fine grading.
The school district shall provide the subdivider with engineering plans for
such grading and berming and all work performed pursuant to this subsection
shall be in accordance with such plans.
   B.   Utilities And Other Improvements: Each dedicated site shall be provided
with the following utilities to the property line and other improvements at no
cost to the school district:
      1.   Sanitary sewer adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of eight
inches (8") in diameter or such greater size as may be required by the village.
If the sanitary sewer service is located across the right of way from the site,
the subdivider shall provide a capped service line to the property of the same
size as the line located across the right of way.
      2.   Water lines adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of ten inches
(10") in diameter. If the water line is across the right of way from the site,
the subdivider shall provide a capped service line to the property of the same
size as the line located across the right of way.
      3.   Storm sewers shall be provided at appropriate locations to properly
drain the site, in accordance with the engineering plans provided by the school
district and approved by the village.
      4.   Other utilities, such as electric, gas and telephone shall be
provided adjacent to or at the property line.
      5.   The subdivider shall seed the entire site with a blend approved by
the school district. Seeding shall include placement, watering as necessary and
mowing until such time as a full stand of turf is established and accepted by
the school district, but not less than one full growing season.
      6.   The subdivider shall install all public walks, curbs, pavement,
sewers and utilities along all site frontages as required by this title. The
subdivider shall also provide a curb cut for maintenance access to the site.
      7.   The storage of overburden on a site is prohibited, although
temporary storage may be granted in some cases by the school district. The
terms of such temporary storage shall be determined by the school district.
      8.   Where a subdivider dedicates an entire school site, the subdivider
shall be responsible for the design, layout and construction of storm water,
sanitary sewer and water facilities to the property line of adjacent
properties.
      9.   To ensure the timely installation of said improvements the village
may require the posting of a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in a form
and from a financial institution which are both acceptable to the village. This
bond or letter of credit shall be in accordance with all requirements of the
village's ordinances. (Ord. 901, 4-18-2006)
5-6-9: TITLE INSURANCE, SURVEY, ASSESSMENT PLATS:
Each deed conveying land to the village shall be accompanied by the following:
   A.   A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do business
in Illinois to insure that grantor has good merchantable title to such real
estate in an amount subject only to then current general real estate taxes as
of the date of transfer; covenants, conditions and restrictions which do not
prohibit the use of the subject real estate for school, park or village use;
utility easements located within twenty feet (20') of the boundary lines of the
subject real estate, drainage ditches, feeders, laterals and underground pipe
or other conduit.
   B.   A current boundary line survey, certified to the grantee by a licensed
Illinois land surveyor to be in compliance with the Illinois land survey
standards.
   C.   Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed is a lot in a
recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in form
acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be
conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number for
exemption purposes. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-10: ANNEXATION AGREEMENTS:
The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof, or combination
of both, as required by this chapter shall also, as a matter of policy of the
village, be required as a condition to the annexation of any land to the
village and provisions therefor shall be incorporated in any annexation
agreement governing such land. Additionally, the village shall notify the
appropriate school districts when a party submits a proposed annexation
agreement to the village so that the school districts may discuss dedication
issues with said party. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-11: PAYMENT:
   A.   Time Of Payment: All required donations shall be conveyed to the
village in fee simple for subsequent conveyance to the appropriate taxing body.
The dedication of land shall be made at the time of final plat approval by the
village board of trustees for the proposed subdivision or development. Cash
contributions shall be made at the time of the issuance of a building permit.
   B.   Method Of Payment: The cash contributions required hereunder shall be
made by certified check or money order payable to the village and shall be
deposited with the village. The village clerk shall keep a record of these
receipts. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-12: INDEMNIFICATION; HOLD HARMLESS; RELEASE:
The village shall not collect funds under this chapter for any taxing body
which does not, prior to the effective date hereof, enter into an
intergovernmental agreement with the village which provides that such taxing
body will hold harmless, indemnify and release the village upon such terms and
conditions as are acceptable to the village. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-
1998)
5-6-13: FUNDS:
   A.   Accounting Of Funds: Each district receiving funds under this chapter
shall annually make a written report to the village detailing the amount of
funds received and how such funds were expended. This report shall be provided
to the village prior to January 15 of each year. The village shall not disperse
future funds to a district until the written report detailing the amount of
funds expended for the previous calendar year has been accepted by the village.
   B.   Expenditure Of Funds: All fees collected under this chapter shall only
be expended toward the purchase of capital improvements, including, but not
limited to, property acquisition, construction of structures, additions and
improvements to existing structures or facilities and bond payments related to
these eligible expenditures. Annual operational expenditure is not an eligible
expenditure of these contributions. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6-14: PERIODIC REVIEW:
The village shall review this chapter every three (3) years to determine
whether the land value and demographic information herein set forth is
consistent with the current values. Additionally, three (3) years after the
effective date hereof, any or all affected school districts may submit a
demographic study based upon local information and data for the village's
consideration. The village may, at its sole option, adopt such a local study to
be used for calculations under this chapter. (Ord. 669, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-
1998)
5-6-15: SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION IMPACT FEE:
   A.   General: As a condition of final approval of any subdivision or planned
unit development, or the approval of a permit for the construction of a new
dwelling unit, each developer, subdivider or builder (hereinafter "developer")

5-6A-1: DEDICATION OF PARK SITES; FEES IN LIEU THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of
planned unit development, each subdivider, developer, builder or owner will be
required to:
   A.   Dedicate land for park sites to serve the immediate and future needs of
the residents of the development;
   B.   Make cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedication; or
   C.   A combination of both, at the option of the village upon recommendation
of the park districts affected in accordance with the following criteria and
formula set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 668, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6A-2: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK SITE DEDICATION:
   A.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be 9.81 acres of land per one thousand
(1,000) of ultimate population. Population figures are obtained from the table
of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit found in section
5-6-4 of this title. (Ord. 801, 3-2-2004)
   B.   Location: The location of the site to be dedicated shall be determined
by the village board of trustees upon recommendation of the plan commission and
the board of commissioners of the park district having, or to have jurisdiction
of the park to be erected on the site taking into account the suitability of
the site for park and recreational purposes and its relationship to population
concentrations. A central location which will serve equally the entire
development is most desirable. In large developments these sites can be located
throughout the development according to established standards for distances as
established by the comprehensive plan of the park district then in effect. The
village board of trustees shall not select the site without allowing
opportunity for the board of commissioners of the park district affected to
make a recommendation with respect thereto. The village acknowledges that the
park district cannot be compelled to accept any land dedication which the park
district does not want to accept. In the event the park district refuses to
accept a parcel of land which has been selected to be set aside pursuant to the
provisions hereof, the village may require cash contributions in lieu of the
dedication of said parcel of land or may at the sole option of the village
require dedication or conveyance of the parcel to the village or to such other
person or organization as the village board of trustees determines to be best
suited to meet the recreational needs of the residents.
   C.   Credit For Private Open Spaces; Recreation Areas: When subdividers,
developers, builders or owners provide private recreation areas and facilities,
it may have the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreation
services. However, such private areas and facilities are difficult or
impossible to develop and maintain. Ownership usually is surrendered to the
adjacent owners or to a homeowners' association, who may not have the personnel
or the financial resources for maintenance and improvement. There may,
nevertheless, be instances in which the public is better served by providing
for private recreation areas and facilities in lieu of public ones. Credit for
private recreation areas and facilities may be allowed only where a
determination has been made by the village board of trustees that private
recreational areas in lieu of, or in conjunction with publicly dedicated
recreational areas, will by reason of type of development, better serve the
interests of the public than total land dedication. (Ord. 668, 3-3-1998, eff.
5-1-1998)
5-6A-3: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK SITES:
   A.   Requirement, Use Of Contributions: Where the development is "small" as
used herein and the resulting size of the land contributed is too small to be
practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a park site, and it
is determined by the village after recommendation by the affected park district
not to require the dedication of land, the village shall require the
subdivider, developer, builder or owner to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
the land dedication required. In considering whether a development is "small"
as used herein, the village may consider whether the total number of the
proposed dwelling units will produce less than the maximum number of residents
for one park in accordance with this chapter. The cash contributions in lieu of
park sites shall be paid to the village prior to the issuance of building
permits. The village shall turn over any and all dollars actually collected for
such fees to the appropriate park districts semiannually. Such contributions
shall be used solely for the acquisition of land for a park site to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents from that subdivision or development
or for the improvement to any existing park sites and buildings which serve
such needs. Improvement under this section shall be liberally construed and
shall include, but shall not be limited to, the development of parking lots;
sidewalks; traffic signals; arterial streets; collector streets; internal
roadways; connections with sewer, water and electrical lines; playgrounds;
recreation grounds; and athletic fields. Improvement shall also include the
purchase of any material, goods or equipment necessary to said development and
construction. Improvement shall further include the construction of buildings,
additions to existing park buildings or facilities and bond payments related to
these eligible expenditures. Annual operational expenditures are not an
eligible expenditure of these contributions.
   B.   Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park sites. It
has been determined that the present "fair market value" of such improved land
in and surrounding the village is thirty five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) per
acre, and such figure shall be used in making calculation for park
contributions unless the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of a planned
unit development files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such
objection, the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of the planned unit
development shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such
improved land in the area of his subdivision or planned unit development or
other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair market value" per
acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board based upon such
information submitted by the subdivider, developer, builder or owner of the
planned unit development and from other sources which may be submitted to the
village board by the park district or others.
PARK DISTRICT CASH CONTRIBUTION PER UNIT
Type Of Unit Cash Contribution
Type Of Unit            Cash Contribution
Detached single-family:  
 2 bedroom             $ 942.84
 3 bedroom             1,014.60
 4 bedroom             1,199.66
 5 bedroom             1,353.83
Attached single-family:  
 2 bedroom             554.85
 3 bedroom             677.77
 4 bedroom             950.05
 
Formula:
   Contribution: pyf x paf x lv
pyf = estimated total population per dwelling
paf = minimum # of acres (9.81) divided by 1,000 (population per 9.81 acres)
(9.81/1,000 = 0.00981)
lv = $35,000.00 (estimated value of fully developed acre of land)
Based on 2000 Ehlers And Associates population generated figures
In cases where the village requires a combination of site dedication and cash
contribution, the amount of the required cash contribution as herein set forth
shall be reduced by the percentage of land required to be, but not dedicated.
For example, if the projected impact of a development requires nine and eighty
one one-hundredths (9.81) acres of land to be dedicated and it is determined to
instead require dedication of one-half (1/2) the amount of required land (i.e.,
4.905 acres) and to require a cash contribution in lieu of the balance of land,
then the dollar amount required by this section shall be reduced by one-half
(1/2). (Ord. 1203, 8-4-2015)
   C.   Criteria For Requiring Land Dedication And A Contribution: There will
be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination
of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
      1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision or
planned unit development falling within the park location shall be dedicated as
a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required
for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated.
      2.   A major part of the park site has already been acquired and only a
small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The
remaining portions shall be required by dedication and a cash contribution in
lieu thereof shall also be required to fulfill the obligations of that
development. (Ord. 668, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6A-4: DENSITY FORMULA:
The table of estimated ultimate population density found in section
5-6-4 of this title is generally indicative of current and short range
projected trends in family size for newly constructed residential units as
determined by Ehlers And Associates and shall be used in calculating the amount
of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu
thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider,
developer, builder or owner of the planned unit development. In the event a
subdivider, developer, builder or owner of a subdivision or planned unit
development files a written objection to the table of estimated ultimate
population listed herein, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned
unit development, and, in that event, final determination of the density
formula to be used in such calculation shall be made by the village board based
upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider, developer,
builder or owner of the subdivision or planned unit development, from other
sources which may be submitted to the village board from the park districts or
others, and upon consideration of such information which most accurately and
fairly represents current demographic trends. (Ord. 668, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-
1998; amd. Ord. 901, 4-18-2006)
5-6A-5: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND:
Nothing herein contained shall limit the authority of the village to require
the designation and reservation of park sites, or other public lands as a
condition to approval of any plat of subdivision or planned unit development
where such land is to be acquired by condemnation within one year from final
plat approval as set forth under division 12, article 11 of the Illinois
municipal code. (Ord. 668, 3-3-1998, eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6A-6: COMBINATION WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENT:
Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than forty (40)
acres, a park site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined
with dedications from adjoining subdivisions or planned unit developments in
order to produce usable park sites without hardship on a particular subdivider,
developer, builder or owner of a planned unit development. (Ord. 668, 3-3-1998,
eff. 5-1-1998)
5-6A-7: TOPOGRAPHY AND SOILS:
   A.   Regulations: Park sites must possess suitable topography and soil sites
for the use to which they are dedicated. The subdivider shall provide the park
district with current soil analysis tests from a minimum of one soil boring per
acre to a minimum depth of fifteen feet (15'). The subdivider shall also
provide the park district with a phase I environmental study which shall
consist of a site assessment and environmental audit which covers the ownership
and known uses of the property described and any improvements and facilities
(including equipment) thereon for the past one hundred (100) years and
addresses the current uses of the property and its compliance with
environmental laws including, without limitations, all appropriate inquiries
into the previous ownership and uses of the land consistent with good
commercial and prudent engineering practices in an effort to minimize liability
for hazardous materials. Any hazardous materials or underground storage tanks
found on the site shall be removed by the subdivider prior to dedication.
   B.   Dimensions: Park sites should be generally rectangular in shape with
dimensions generally proportioned to the ratio of a depth of three (3) to a
width of two (2). This criteria shall not apply to park sites contemplated for
extraordinary types of facilities such as, but not limited to, trails and
shoreline frontages.
   C.   Frontage: Park sites shall have, at a minimum, adequate frontage along
a publicly dedicated street to allow convenient access and, if necessary,
parking facilities that will not adversely affect adjoining residential
property. Generally, thirty feet (30') of frontage will be provided for every
acre of land that is dedicated; provided, however, that the minimum acceptable
frontage for any site will be one hundred fifty feet (150'). (Ord. 901, 4-18-
2006)
5-6A-8: IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED FOR LAND DEDICATIONS:
Park sites to be dedicated by a subdivider shall include the following land
improvements prior to dedication:
   A.   Each dedicated site shall be graded to drain storm and surface water at
a minimum of two percent (2%) for open areas; and slopes on berms, when berms
are required, shall not exceed four to one (4:1). Grading shall include, but
not be limited to: berms for separation and screening from adjoining
properties; placement of six inches (6") of topsoil and fine grading. The park
district shall provide the subdivider with engineering plans for such grading
and berming and all work performed pursuant to this subsection shall be in
accordance with such plans.
   B.   Sanitary sewer adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of eight inches
(8") in diameter or such greater size as may be required by the village. If the
sanitary sewer service is located across the right of way from the site, the
subdivider shall provide a capped service line to the property of the same size
as the line located across the right of way.
   C.   Water lines adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of ten inches (10")
in diameter. If the water line is across the right of way from the site, the
subdivider shall provide a capped service line to the property of the same size
as the line located across the right of way.
   D.   Storm sewers shall be provided at appropriate locations to properly

hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   C.   To protect new building and major improvements to buildings from flood
damage;
   D.   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   E.   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations; and
   F.   To make Federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the Village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
   G.   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59 - 79, as amended;
   H.   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources;

future 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a one-tenth foot
(0.1') increase in stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no
more than a ten percent (10%) increase in velocities. The regulatory floodways
of the Village are designated on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map prepared
by FEMA and dated February 15, 2019. The regulatory floodways for those parts
of unincorporated Will County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the Village that may be annexed in the Village are designated on the Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map prepared for Will County by FEMA and dated February
15, 2019. To locate the regulatory floodway boundary on any site, the
regulatory floodway boundary should be scaled off the regulatory floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory
floodway boundary, the division should be contacted for the interpretation.

Rate Map as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V30, VE, V, M, or E.
   STRUCTURE: The results of a man-made change to the land constructed on or
below the ground, including the construction, reconstruction or placement of a
building or any addition to a building; installing a manufactured home on a
site; preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a travel trailer
on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either: a) before the improvement or repair is
started, or b) if the structure has been damaged from any source, and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition
"substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either: a) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local Health,

6-1-3: HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER:
The Village Engineer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties
listed in section
6-1-4 of this chapter.
To fulfill those duties, the Village Engineer first should use the criteria
listed in section 6-1-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine
whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been
determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the Village Engineer
must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a
regulatory floodway, or within an SFHA or floodplain on which no floodway has
been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the Village shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
6-1-6 of this chapter be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Village
Engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section
6-1-7 of this chapter be met. If the site is located within an SFHA or
floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the
Village Engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section
6-1-8 of this chapter be met.
In addition, the general requirements of section
6-1-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
6-1-6,
6-1-7, or
6-1-8 of this chapter. The Village Engineer shall assure that all subdivision
proposals shall meet the requirements of section
 6-1-10 of this chapter.
If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Village Engineer shall
review the requirements of section
6-1-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the Village
Engineer shall complete all notification requirements.
In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this
chapter, the Village Engineer may take any and all actions as outlined in
section
6-1-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-4: DUTIES OF THE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL(S):
The Village Engineer shall be responsible for the general administration and
enforcement of this chapter which shall include the following:
   A.   Determining The Floodplain Designation: Check all new development sites
to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they
are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a
floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted which drains more
than one square mile.
   B.   Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a
floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted
which drains more than one square mile, then the permit shall be referred to a
registered professional engineer (PE) under the employ or contract of the
Village for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of
section
6-1-7 of this chapter. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in
writing that the development meets the requirements of section
6-1-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
   C.   Dam Safety Requirements: Permits for dams may be required from IDNR/
OWR. Contact IDNR/OWR to determine if a permit is required. If a permit is
required, a permit application must be made to IDNR/OWR prior to the

after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
they comply with the provisions of this chapter.
   G.   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain in the permit files
an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building or the
elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a
floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to section
 6-1-9 of this chapter for public inspection and provide copies of same.
   H.   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and regulatory floodway maps, copies
of Federal or State permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as
built" elevation and floodproofing or elevation and floodproofing certificates
for all buildings constructed subject to this chapter. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
   I.   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections

6-1-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance Study for
Will County, Illinois, prepared by the FEMA, dated February 15, 2019. If a base
flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a
particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best
existing data available from Federal, State or other sources. When a party
disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit
it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA.
   A.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHA of
Wilson Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study of Will County prepared by FEMA and dated February 15, 2019,
and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to
time.
   B.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Will County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the Village shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Will
County prepared by FEMA and dated February 15, 2019, and such amendments or
revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. (Ord.
1289-19, 2-5-2019)
   C.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an AH Zone or AO Zone shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village. (Ord. 620, 8-15-
1995)
   D.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an A Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Village shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois
State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository. When no base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model,
such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in
the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I,
TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by
the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood
flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the
watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along
any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall
be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval, once approved it must be submitted to
the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing.
For a non-riverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood
of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed engineering
study and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
6-1-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other provisions of this chapter
are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section 6-1-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
   A.   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body
not exempted by State law shall commence any development in the SFHA without
first obtaining a development permit from the Village Engineer. (Ord. 613, 4-5-
1995)
   B.   Application Contents: Application for a development permit shall be
made on a form provided by the Village Engineer. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed
engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in MSL 1988,
adj. datum or NAVD and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section
6-1-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
   C.   Comparison; Documentation: Upon receipt of a development permit
application, the Village Engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located
on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as
of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the SFHA
and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The Village
Engineer shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to
the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
   D.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control Plan: A soil erosion and
sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan
shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the
temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate
their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final
stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a
responsible party to ensure post- construction maintenance.
   E.   Copies Of Permits: The Village Engineer shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant, copies of all other local, State and Federal
permits, approvals or permit- not-required letters that may be required for
this type of activity. The Village Engineer shall not issue a permit unless all
other local, State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   F.   Preventing Increased Drainages: No development in the flood fringe
shall create a threat to public health and safety.
   G.   Removal From Floodplain: If fill is being used to elevate the site
above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for
the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
   H.   Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and five-
tenths (1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below
the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-
year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:
This section applies to proposed development, redevelopment, site modification
or building modification within a regulatory floodway. The regulatory floodways
of the Village shall be as delineated on the regulatory floodway maps
designated by IDNR/OWR according and referenced in section

meet the criteria in this section. All floodway modifications shall be the
minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the project. The development
shall also meet the requirements of section
6-1-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
   A.   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by State law shall commence any development in a floodway without
first obtaining a development permit from the Village Engineer.
   B.   Application Contents: Application for a development permit shall be
made on a form provided by the Village Engineer. The application shall include
the following information:

(Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      15.   If the regulatory floodway delineation, base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation will change due to the proposed project, the
application will not be considered complete until IDNR/OWR has indicated
conditional approval of the Regulatory Floodway Map change. No structures may
be built until a letter of map revision has been approved by FEMA. (Ord. 1289-
19, 2-5-2019)
      16.   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by drawings of

professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the Village shall review
and approve applications reviewed under this section. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
   D.   Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses: The only
development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which
will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a
damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a
threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic
and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair
existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be
minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only
those appropriate uses listed in 17 Illinois Administrative Code 3708 will be
allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and "storage of materials" except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: (Ord. 1289-19,
2-5-2019)
      1.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife; (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      2.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access
to the water or shoreline and facilities and improvements related to
recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water-
dependent uses; (Ord. 650, 6-17-1997)
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
      4.   Underground and overhead utilities;
      5.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any 1
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions; (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      6.   Reserved. (Ord. 650, 6-17-1997)
      7.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto; (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      8.   Reserved. (Ord. 650, 6-17-1997)
      9.   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a watercourse;
      10.   Flood proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure; (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      11.   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation.
      12.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      13.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
         a.   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will
not exceed 1.0 foot; or
         b.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events.
      14.   Aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation where
the depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0
foot.
   E.   Permissible Appropriate Use: Within the regulatory floodway as
identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the
construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided
that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure
meets the protections requirements of section
 6-1-9 of this chapter:
      1.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages
Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-
stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: (Ord.
1289-19, 2-5-2019)
         a.   Regulatory floodway conveyance,
 
    1.486  
"K" = n     AR2/3
 
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the
cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See
Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New
York.)
         b.   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a Federal,
State, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
         c.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of
effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency: (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
            (1)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
            (2)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
            (3)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction,
a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of
stream length shall be used.
            (4)   Transition sections shall be provided between cross- sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            (5)   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      2.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and five-tenths
(1.5) times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage
lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to
be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no
reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification,
unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
      3.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts
or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in
the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However in the case of
bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased
at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by
the use of rip-rap or other design measures. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      4.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches: The proposed structures shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1') when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase
upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1'), the developer must
contact IDNR/OWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver.
         a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
6-1-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly
accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
         b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection E2
of this section.
         c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection E3 of this
section. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
         d.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
         e.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by
subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
         f.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per subsection E8 of this section.
      5.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And
Approach Roads:
         a.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than one- tenth foot (0.1')
increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies
up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a
source of flood damage.
         b.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. (Ord. 613, 4-5-
1995)
         c.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a
source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance
with the 17 Illinois Administrative Code 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the division for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
      6.   On-Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any
increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver for any
structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal
or flood flow. All "dams" and impoundment "structures" as defined in section
6-1-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois
Administrative Code, part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-
2019)
         a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
         b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish
species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle,
such as for spawning;
         c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin;
         d.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effect of sediment runoff as well as minimize
the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there
is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in
which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream
municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
         e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
      7.   Flood Proofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      8.   Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for
lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
         a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
         b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and
         c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used;
         d.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      9.   Channel Modifications: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
         a.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would
accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body
of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization,
flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a
stream side buffer strip of green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish
and wildlife habitat;
         b.   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
         c.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria;
            (1)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
            (2)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
            (3)   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
            (4)   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for construction of the channel.
            (5)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practical.
Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
            (6)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
            (7)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established
where appropriate.
            (8)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
            (9)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
            (10)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
            (11)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
         d.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
      10.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      11.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to the
initiation of improvements.
         b.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to
denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion
of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at
final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
         c.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment basins.
         d.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in
width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels (see subsection E16 of this section). Construction vehicle use of
channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed,
where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along
channels shall be restabilized immediately.
         e.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed
and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green
Book" and "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control"
(IEPA, 1987). (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
      12.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. (Ord.
613, 4-5-1995; amd. Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
      13.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
         a.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory
floodway study, referenced in section
 6-1-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
         b.   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         c.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      14.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA
all the information, calculations, and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is
issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by IDNR/
OWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA
and IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued. After initial filling, grading,
dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final Letter of
Map Revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. (Ord.
1289-19, 2-5-2019)
      15.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall
be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
      16.   Floodway Construction Near The Channel: For all activities in the
floodway involving the construction within twenty five feet (25') of the
channel, the following criteria shall be met:
         a.   All natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         b.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
         c.   The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer
strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for
stream maintenance purposes.
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and
issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as
necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use
may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a
final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built"
plans.
   F.   State Review: For those projects listed below located in a regulatory
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their
review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
      1.   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due
to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection E4 of this section.
      2.   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection E5 of this
section.
      3.   The IDNR/OWR will review alternative transition sections and
hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections E1, E2 and E3 of this
section.
      4.   The IDNR/OWR will review and approve prior to the start of
construction any department projects, "dams" (as defined in section
6-1-2 of this chapter) and all other State, Federal or local units of
government projects, including projects of the Municipality or County.
   G.   Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes,
5/5 et seq. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the division has
delegated this responsibility to the Village.
   H.   Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a "dam" as defined in section
6-1-2 of this chapter per 17 Illinois Administrative Code, part 3702 (Rules for
Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of
such work. If the Village Engineer finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR
permit, the Village Engineer shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett
office (or such other office as IDNR/OWR may designate from time to time). If
the Village Engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition,
the Village Engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/

chapter, including the mitigation requirements. (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
6-1-8: OCCUPATION AND USE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT
IDENTIFIED:
In SFHA or floodplains, (including AO, AH or unnumbered A Zones) where no
floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile,
no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the
proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and
structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of
the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation.
   A.   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body,
not exempted by State law, shall commence any development in an SFHA or
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the Village
Engineer. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided

      4.   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a
minimum:
         a.   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale, and north arrow; (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
         b.   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing
existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1988 adjustment) datum or
NAVD, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the
proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water)
floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross- sections, north arrow, and
a graphical or numerical scale; (Ord. 1289-19, 2-5-2019)
         c.   Cross-section views of the project and engineering study reach
showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water

existing data according to the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain
Information Repository, the Village Engineer shall compare the elevation of the
site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no
elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall
calculate the elevation according to subsection
6-1-5D of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be shown to
have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the sites first Flood
Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not
subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building official shall
maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site
and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
   C.   Copies Of Permits: The Village Engineer shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, State, and Federal
permits, approvals or permit- not-required letters that may be required for
this type of activity. The Village Engineer shall not issue the development
permit unless all required local, State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   D.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the SFHA, where a
floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health,
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
   E.   Riverine SFHA Standards: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway
has not been determined, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   Engineering Requirements And Study: The developer shall have a
registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting
plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering
requirements of subsections
6-1-7E1 through E12 of this chapter for the entire floodplain as calculated
under the provisions of section
6-1-5 of this chapter. As an alternative, the developer should have an
engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering
study to IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of
their floodway by the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the
project meets the requirements of section
6-1-7 of this chapter for the regulatory floodway. The "floodway" shall be
defined according to the definition in section
6-1-2 of this chapter.
      2.   Development Permit: A development permit shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation
that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR.
      3.   No Permit Required: No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the
division has delegated permit responsibility to the Village per 17 Illinois
Administrative Code, part 3708 for regulatory floodways, per IDNR/OWR's
Statewide permit entitled "Construction in Floodplains With No Designated
Floodways in Northeastern Illinois".
      4.   Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction,
modification or removal of a "dam" or an on-stream "structure" to impound water
as defined in section
6-1-2 of this chapter shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam. If the Village Engineer finds a dam that does not have
an IDNR/OWR permit, the Village Engineer shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR
Bartlett office. If the Village Engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in
unsafe condition, the Village Engineer shall immediately notify the owner of
the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office, and the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency (IEMA).

volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and five-
tenths (1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below
the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-
year floodplain elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-
year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood
elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly
to the watercourse. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-9: PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS:
In addition to the requirements found in sections
6-1-6,
6-1-7 and
6-1-8 of this chapter for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways,
and SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (Zones A, AO,
AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements
shall be met:
   A.   Health Standards: Public health standards.
   B.   Prohibited Materials: No developments in the SFHA shall include
locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes,
fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic
materials below the FPE.
   C.   Aboveground Openings: New and replacement water supply systems, wells,
sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted
providing all manholes or other aboveground openings located below the FPE are

   D.   Carrying Capacity And Notification: For all projects involving channel
modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood
carrying capacity of the watercourses shall be maintained. In addition, the
Village shall notify adjacent communities in writing thirty (30) days prior to
the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
   E.   Protecting Buildings: All buildings located within a 100-year
floodplain also known as an SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below
the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a
regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use
standards included in section
6-1-7 of this chapter. This building protection criteria applies to the
following situations:
      1.   Construction or placement of a new building;
      2.   A structural alteration to an existing building that either
increases the first floor area by more than twenty percent (20%) or the
building's market value by more than fifty percent (50%);
      3.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply
to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was
removed to avoid flood damage; and
      4.   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days.
This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following
methods.

with the following:
      1.   The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood
protection elevation.
      2.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot (1')
deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet (10') beyond the
foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation.
The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the
ten foot (10') minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic
pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill
shall not adversely effect the flow or surface drainage from or onto
neighboring properties.
   G.   Elevation: A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in
accordance with the following:
      1.   The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space,
stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is permanently open to flood
waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or
100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than one foot
(1') above grade, and consist of a minimum of two (2) openings. The openings
must have a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood
elevation.
      2.   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned
in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure
to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating debris.
      3.   All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed
of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement)
and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above the flood protection
elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible
pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood
protection elevation.
      4.   No area below the flood protection elevation shall be used for
storage of items or materials.
      5.   Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for
more than one hundred eighty (180) days, shall be elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation; and, shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the rules
and regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to 77
Illinois Administrative Code 870. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
   H.   Dry Floodproofing: Nonconforming structures may be structurally dry
floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a registered professional
engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed
below the flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility
facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces,
the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures
shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of
electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered
floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection). (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995; amd.
Ord. 650, 6-17-1997)
Tool sheds and detached garages on an existing single- family platted lot, may
be constructed with the lowest floor below the flood protection elevation in
accordance with the following:
      1.   The building is not used for human habitation.
      2.   All areas below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
shall be constructed with waterproof material. Structures located in a
regulatory floodway shall be constructed and placed on a building site so as
not to block the flow of flood waters and shall also meet the appropriate use
criteria of Section
6-1-7 of this Chapter. In addition, all other requirements of Sections
 6-1-6,
6-1-7 and
6-1-8 of this Chapter must be met.
      3.   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation.
      4.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be

      6.   The building shall be used only for the storage of vehicles or tools
and may not contain other rooms, workshops, greenhouses or similar uses.
   I.   Alteration; Restoration: Nonconforming structures located in a
regulatory floodway may remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or
structurally altered. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or
other natural or manmade disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds
fifty percent (50%) of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it
shall conform to this Chapter. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-10: OTHER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
The Board of Trustees shall take into account flood hazards, to the extent that
they are known in all official actions related to land management, use and
development.
   A.   New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements, and
planned unit developments (PUDS) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure
that the proposed developments are consistent with Sections
6-1-6,
6-1-7,
6-1-8 and
6-1-9 of this Chapter and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans for
new subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned unit developments (PUDS) shall

parks, planned unit developments (PUDS) and additions to manufactured home
parks and additions to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this
information is not available from an existing study filed with the Illinois
State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for
calculating the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation per Section
6-1-5 and the "floodway delineation" per the definition in Section
6-1-2 of this Chapter and submitting it to the State Water Survey and IDNR/OWR
for review and approval as best available regulatory data.
   C.   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located
and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and
channels. Wherever possible, the flood plains shall be included within parks or
other public grounds.
   D.   The Board of Trustees shall not approve any planned unit development
(PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such
agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. (Ord.
613, 4-5-95)
6-1-11: VARIANCES:
No variances shall be granted to any development located in a "regulatory
floodway" as defined in Section
6-1-2. However, when a development proposal is located outside of a regulatory
floodway, and whenever the standards of this Chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Plan commission
for a variance. The Plan Commission shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety,
beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation
of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations,
policing, or repairs to streambeds and banks, roads, utilities, or other public
facilities;
      6.   The provisions of Sections
6-1-6 and
6-1-8 of this Chapter shall still be met;
      7.   The activity is not in a regulatory floodway;
      8.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a
general problem; and
      9.   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved including existing stream uses.
   B.   The Village Engineer shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of Section
6-1-9 of this Chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.
   C.   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site or
building listed on the national register of historical places or documented as
worthy of preservation by the Illinois historic preservation agency may be
granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of subsections A
and B of this section. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the SFHA,
will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on
the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-13: PENALTY:
Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance
resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due
investigation, the village engineer may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this chapter exists. The village engineer shall notify the
owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 613, 4-
5-1995)
      2.   Any person convicted of a violation of any section or provision of
this chapter shall be punished by a fine as established in section
1-4-1 of this code for any one offense. (Ord. 791, 8-5-2003; amd. Ord. 1061, 4-
20-2010)
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   B.   The village engineer shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)
6-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinances, village code provisions, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail. This chapter is intended to repeal the original ordinance or
resolution which was adopted to meet the national flood insurance program
regulations, but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the village
passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program. (Ord. 613, 4-
5-1995)
6-1-15: SEPARABILITY:
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the
invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. (Ord. 613, 4-5-1995)

development (section
6-2B-2 of this article), site runoff (section
 6-2B-3 of this article), sediment and erosion control (article C of this
chapter), performance security and maintenance (article F of this chapter).
(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-1-2: APPLICABILITY OF SITE RUNOFF STORAGE REQUIREMENTS (DETENTION):
All developments shall comply with the site runoff storage requirements
provided in section
6-2B-4 of this article in which:
   A.   More than two (2) single-family structures or one multi-family
structure are to be constructed on a parcel or site more than one acre in size;
   B.   Nonresidential land use is to be constructed on a parcel or site more
than one acre in size;
   C.   Existing multi-family or nonresidential land uses on a site one acre or
more in size, on which new development after the effective date hereof in the
aggregate exceeds twenty five thousand (25,000) square feet;
   D.   Roadway developments in rights of way under the ownership or control of
a unit of local governments when the contiguous area of new roadway
construction (excluding previously paved areas) exceeds two (2) acres;
   E.   The developer of a commercial or industrial redevelopment may request
that a fee in lieu of detention be approved provided that all of the following
are demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the administrator:
      1.   The drainage plan will not increase existing flood damages, and
      2.   The drainage plan provides a net benefit in water quality compared
to the existing development.
The administrator shall determine the appropriate fee to be collected as
defined in article M of this chapter, and his or her decision in the matter
shall be considered final. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-2: GENERAL STORM WATER REQUIREMENTS:
6-2B-2-1: REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL DEVELOPMENT:
No development shall:
   A.   Result in any new or additional expense to any person other than the
developer for flood protection; nor
   B.   Increase flood elevations or decrease flood conveyance capacity
upstream or downstream of the area under the ownership or control of the
developer. This requirement shall not prohibit the removal or reduction of
built obstructions to flow, such as increasing culvert capacity or lowering
roadway elevations; nor
   C.   Increase runoff rates (from the 10-year event up to the 100-year event)
to any downstream properties unless the developer can demonstrate that the
increased runoff rates can be safely conveyed via storm sewers, ditches (if
allowed), or overland flow paths to the next downstream receiving stream, lake
or pond. If the developer is significantly raising runoff rates to downstream
properties and cannot demonstrate downstream conveyance capacity, some amount
of on site storm water management may be required in order to reduce the
proposed runoff rate down to existing runoff rates. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-2-2: REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL SUBDIVISIONS AND COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS:
All developments shall:
   A.   Extend the storm sewer system through the proposed development to serve
upstream properties in the natural drainage area. The storm sewer system should
reflect the ultimate development of the drainage area.
   B.   Provide a storm water drainage system that consists of a minor drainage
system, a major drainage system and an emergency overland flow route.
   C.   The storm sewer drainage system is assumed to consist of such
components as sewers, channels, swales, natural drainageways, inlets, catch
basins, manholes, streets, detention/retention basins, and other necessary
facilities.
   D.   The engineering plans shall have a certification by a registered
professional engineer as follows:
To the best of our knowledge and belief the drainage of surface waters will not
be changed by the construction of such subdivision or any part thereof or that
if such surface water drainage will change, adequate provision has been made
for the collection and diversion of such surface waters into public areas or
drains which the subdivider has a right to use, and that such surface waters
will not be deposited on the property of adjoining land owners in such
concentrations as may cause damage to the adjoining property because of the
construction of the subdivision.
Dated at              , this       day of      , A.D. 20   .
                                                         (Seal)
      Design Engineer
   E.   The storm sewer system shall be entirely separate from the sanitary
sewer system.
   F.   Storm sewers shall be designed to convey the peak flow from a 10-year
rainfall event with a hydraulic grade line that is entirely within the pipe.
Rainfall frequency data shall be obtained from the table attached to the
ordinance codified herein. Storm sewers and outfalls shall be designed to
function at their design capacity during flooding conditions on the receiving
stream or other body of water.
   G.   The storm sewers shall be a minimum of twelve inches (12") in diameter
and shall be constructed of reinforced concrete pipe only.
   H.   No ditch system shall be permitted on any new site developments. The
minor drainage system shall be constructed so that the drainage from each lot
or parcel is conveyed entirely through storm sewer pipe.
   I.   The major drainage system may be permitted to flow over roadways, rear
yard and side yard swales, and other open conveyances as long as the maximum
depth of ponding or flow is no more than nine inches (9") on pavement and one
foot (1') at any other location and the maximum water surface elevation is at
least one foot (1') below the lowest opening of any nearby structure. The
design of the major drainage system may account for the minor drainage system
(storm sewers) to be fully functional. No flow is allowed over the road,
perpendicular to the roadway.
   J.   Rear yard and side yard swales shall meet the following conditions:
      1.   The maximum side slopes shall be a four to one (4:1) ratio.
      2.   The appropriate easements are provided, a minimum of twenty feet
(20') wide.
   K.   Inlets/catch basins on roadways shall be located as necessary to
collect surface water, but spacing shall not exceed a maximum of four hundred
feet (400'). Inlets shall only be used for the first "run" and catch basins
shall be placed before a storm sewer enters a manhole. Manholes shall be
located at the junction of two (2) or more storm sewer pipes or at any change
in grade alignment or size of pipe. Maximum spacing of manholes shall be per
the village subdivision and development regulations.
   L.   All storm sewers shall use materials, and be installed in the manner
meeting or exceeding the requirements, standards, and specifications contained
in the "Standard Specifications For Water And Sewer Main Construction In
Illinois", the most current edition as amended, supplemented and amended by the
village engineer. These standards and specifications, with the modifications,
amendments, and amplifications of the village engineer, are available for
purchase or inspection and review in the office of the village engineer.
   M.   Where applicable, the developer shall install storm systems sufficient
in size and depth to carry the storm runoff from upstream properties naturally
tributary to the proposed subdivision. The village shall make special
provisions for that developer to recapture those additional costs incurred as a
result of oversizing and/or overexcavating the storm sewer system. (Ord. 947,
3-20-2007)
6-2B-2-3: BUILDING PERMITS:
Storm water facilities shall be functional before building permits are issued
for residential and nonresidential subdivision. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-2-4: SINGLE PARCEL DEVELOPMENTS:
Storm water facilities shall be functional where practicable for single parcel
developments before building construction begins. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-2-5: OVERLAND FLOW PATHS:
The development shall have an overland flow path at the downstream limit of the
property that will pass the base flood flow without increasing damage to
structures or property. Overland flow paths internal to the site shall be
considered as part of the major storm water system and shall be designed for
conveyance of the base flood (critical duration) and shall be a minimum of one
cfs per tributary acre without damage to structures. If the storm sewer pipe
and inlet sized for the base flood can be constructed in lieu of providing an
overland flow path as a part of the major drainage system, then the overland
flow path shall be considered an emergency overland flow path and it shall not
be considered a part of the major storm water system but must still meet the
protection of buildings criteria in section
6-2B-2-6 of this article.
For all overland flow routes, whether a part of the major drainage system or an
emergency overland flow route, the water surface elevation for determining the
FPE (flood protection elevation) shall be calculated assuming that the storm
sewers are inoperable.
Structures of any kind, including fences, shall not be permitted in overland
flow paths draining more than twenty (20) acres, unless the structures are
otherwise permissible and certified by a professional engineer or professional
landscape architect that the proposed structure will not cause any adverse
upstream impacts as a result of blocking or impeding the flow of storm water. A
fence, if permitted, shall conform to the village's fence ordinance provisions
for fences located in drainage easements as applicable. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-2-6: PROTECTION OF BUILDINGS:
All usable space in new buildings or added to existing buildings hydraulically
connected to a major storm water system, site runoff storage facility, or
overland flow path shall be elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected to
at least the FPE. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-2-7: DEPRESSIONAL STORAGE:
The function of existing on site depressional storage shall be preserved for
both on site and off site tributary flows in addition to required detention.
When depressional storage is removed it must be compensated for in the site
runoff storage facility at a one to one (1:1) ratio provided that off site
areas tributary to the existing depressional storage are routed through the
site runoff storage facility. This requirement is in addition to the site
runoff storage required in section
6-2B-4 of this article. The administrator may allow the function of
depressional storage to be preserved if the applicant performs detailed
preproject and postproject hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to identify the
effect of the depressional storage on discharges over a range of rainfall
frequencies. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3: SITE RUNOFF REQUIREMENTS:
6-2B-3-1: STORM WATER FACILITY DISCHARGES:
Storm water facilities shall be required and designed so that runoff exits the
site at a point where it exited prior to the subject development and in a
manner such that flows will not increase flood damage to adjacent property
except when otherwise approved by the administrator. Concentrated discharges
from new developments must enter conveyance systems capable of carrying the
design flow rate without increasing flood damages or maintenance costs
downstream. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-2: MINOR STORM WATER SYSTEM CRITERIA:
Minor storm water systems shall be sized to convey runoff from the tributary
watershed under fully developed conditions for the 10-year storm event. Minor
storm water systems shall be enclosed systems (e.g., storm sewers) unless
otherwise approved by the administrator. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-3: MAJOR STORM WATER SYSTEM CRITERIA:
Major storm water systems shall be sized to carry the base flood without
causing additional flood damage. Maximum flow depths shall be nine inches (9")
in streets, parking lots and driveways, except that parking lots and driveways
intended for access only by commercial trucks may permit maximum flow depths of
twelve inches (12"). The maximum depth of flow in nonpaved drainage easements
shall be twelve inches (12"). The tail water used for the major drainage system
shall be the 10-year water surface elevation in the receiving system or, in the
case of storm water detention facilities, the 2-year design water surface
elevation plus one foot (1'). (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-4: EXISTING SUBSURFACE AND SURFACE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS:
Storm water systems shall properly incorporate and be compatible with existing
subsurface and surface drainage systems including agricultural systems. Designs
shall not cause damage to the existing drainage system(s) or the existing
adjacent or tributary land including those with agricultural uses.
The following principles and requirements shall be observed in the design:
   A.   Off Site Outfall: Agricultural subsurface and surface drainage systems
shall be evaluated with regard to their capacity and capability to properly
convey low flow ground water and site runoff storage facility release without
damage to downstream structure and land use on the adjacent property. If the
outfall drain tile and surface drainage systems prove to be inadequate it will
be necessary to modify the existing systems or construct new systems which will
not conflict with the existing systems and will not impact the existing
agricultural land use. Existing subsurface systems shall only be used with
extended detention design and at the discretion of the administrator.
   B.   On Site: Agricultural drainage systems shall be located and evaluated
on site. All existing on site agricultural drain tile not serving a beneficial
use shall be abandoned by trench removal prior to other development and
recorded on record plans. If any existing drain tiles continue to upland
watersheds the developer must maintain drainage service during construction
until new sewers can be installed for a permanent connection.
   C.   Off Site Tributary: Existing drainage systems shall be evaluated with
regard to existing capabilities and reasonable future expansion capacities. All
existing tributary drain tiles shall be incorporated into the new conduits
including observation structures located at the property limits, shall provide
a free flow discharge and shall not allow surface runoff to enter the system.
   D.   New Roadway Construction: New roadway construction shall preserve
existing subsurface systems within the right of way. Inspection wells shall be
placed at the right of way (ROW) and tiles found to not be flowing between
inspection wells at the end of the construction shall be replaced. (Ord. 947,
3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-5: DESIGN RUNOFF RATE:
Design runoff rates for conveyance (i.e., pipe design) may be calculated using
the rational method for drainage areas of less than twenty (20) acres. For
drainage areas greater than twenty (20) acres the administrator may require the
use of hydrograph routing. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-6: DESIGN RAINFALL:
Any design runoff rate calculation method for conveyance shall use the data
presented in table 1, "Will County Storm Water Technical Guidance Manual
Rainfall Depths And Intensities", attached to the ordinance codified herein.
(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-7: STORM WATER SYSTEM EASEMENTS:
For subdivision projects, the minor, major and emergency storm water systems
shall be located within easements or rights of way explicitly providing for
public access for maintenance of such facilities. For all other projects
requiring a permit, easements are required for public access for maintenance of
storm water facilities only for new construction or modifications involving
components of a drainage system that conveys runoff from off site properties.
Easements and rights of way shall be of sufficient width. Storm sewers shall be
installed at such locations therein as to permit open cut installation,
maintenance and repair within the confines of the easement or right of way
without relocation or other unreasonable interference with other public
utilities located therein, and so as to meet the following minimum standards:
Fifteen feet (15') in width, plus for storm sewers in excess of twenty four
inches (24") in diameter, two (2) additional feet for each twelve inches (12")
or portion thereof of additional storm sewer diameter rounded up to the next
multiple of five feet (5'). Sewers with depths of greater than fifteen feet
(15') may require additional width as determined by the administrator. (Ord.
947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-8: FLOW DEPTHS:
Maximum flow depths for new transverse stream crossings shall not exceed the
crown of the road during the base flood condition. The maximum flow depth on a
roadway shall not exceed nine inches (9") at the curb line for flow parallel to
the roadway. For flow parallel to a new roadway the product of the flow depth
(in feet) and velocity (in feet per second) shall not exceed four (4) for the
base flood condition. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-9: DIVERSION OF FLOW TO ANOTHER WATERSHED:
Transfers of waters between watersheds (diversions) shall be prohibited except
when such transfers will not violate the provisions of section
 6-2B-2-1 of this article and are otherwise lawful. Watersheds for purpose of
regulation under this section shall be the major watershed divides as defined
in the county plan. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-3-10: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES REQUIREMENTS:
The village of Manhattan strongly encourages storm water quality management
within the village of Manhattan. The developments are encouraged to incorporate
the following:
   A.   All best management practices as may be required pursuant to the United
States clean water act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., as amended.
   B.   Manage parcels as unified sites by incorporating watershed based
planning.
   C.   Create designs that promote a healthy aquatic ecology, provide for
sustainability, minimize maintenance, and human intervention.
   D.   Treat storm water as a multiple use resource.
The village of Manhattan does reserve the right to require storm water quality
best management practices at a particular site if the administrator deems that
the discharge is to a sensitive ecological area or that the intended use of the
property produces a particularly detrimental water quality of the discharge.
(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-4: SITE RUNOFF STORAGE REQUIREMENTS (DETENTION/EXTENDED DETENTION):
6-2B-4-1: RELEASE RATE:
If no release rate is specified in an adopted watershed plan, then sufficient
flood storage shall be provided so that the site will not discharge at a rate
greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of development during and after a rainfall event
with a 100-year frequency except for exempted sites. Unless exempted, sites
shall not discharge at a rate greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of development
during and after a rainfall event with a 2-year frequency.
This area of hydrologic disturbance on the site shall be used to calculate the
required site runoff storage volume. The on site watershed area tributary to
the point of discharge shall be used to calculate the allowable release rate
for the site runoff storage facility, which shall be the maximum release rate
allowed considering only the on site watershed area runoff. (Ord. 947, 3-20-
2007)
6-2B-4-2: DESIGN METHODS:
Event hydrograph routing methods shall be used to calculate design runoff
volumes for site runoff facilities. The methods must be HEC-1 (SCS
methodology), HEC-HMS, TR-20, or TR-55 tabular method as appropriate based upon
the rounding limitations of the model used. Proprietary models that use the
approved methods may be accepted at the sole discretion of the administrator.
Digital copies of the model input files shall be provided. For sites of forty
(40) acres or more, the methods used must be acceptable to FEMA. Event methods
shall incorporate the following assumptions:
   A.   Antecedent moisture condition equals two (2); and
   B.   Appropriate Huff rainfall distribution; and
   C.   Twenty four (24) hour duration storm with a one percent (1%)
probability (100-year frequency) of occurrence in any one year as specified by
Illinois state water survey bulletin 70 northeast sectional rainfall
statistics.
Figure 1, attached to the ordinance codified herein, based upon generic
hydrograph curves developed by the Will County storm water management
committee, may be used for sites of twenty (20) acres or less when acceptable
to the administrator. The rational method is not acceptable. (Ord. 947, 3-20-
2007)
6-2B-4-3: EXISTING RELEASE RATE LESS THAN ALLOWABLE:
For sites where the undeveloped release rate is less than the maximum release
rate in section
 6-2B-4-1 of this article, the developed release rate and corresponding site
runoff storage volume shall be based on the existing undeveloped release rate
for the development. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-4-4: DOWNSTREAM WATER SURFACE ELEVATIONS:
All hydrologic and hydraulic computations must utilize appropriate assumptions
for downstream water surface elevations, from low flow through the base flood
elevation, considering the likelihood of concurrent flood events. (Ord. 947, 3-
20-2007)
6-2B-4-5: EXTENDED DETENTION REQUIREMENT:
The requirements of this section will apply only when an existing agricultural
land use is downstream of and adjacent to a site runoff storage facility
outlet. The runoff from a 0.75 inch rainfall event over the hydraulically
connected impervious area of the new development shall be stored below the
elevation of the primary gravity outlet (extended detention) of the site runoff
storage facility. The facility may be designed to allow for evapotransporation
or infiltration of this volume into a subsurface drainage system and shall not
be conveyed through a direct positive connection to downstream areas.
The hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation of required
extended detention volume may be reduced by the administrator if the soils are
prepared to maximize infiltration and deep rooted grasses or other plants
selected for their ability to promote infiltration or water absorption are
planted in areas appropriately dedicated. The reduction in hydraulically
connected impervious area used in the calculation shall be equal to the area of
the development meeting the above soils/native planting requirement.
Subsurface drainage systems may be designed as a component of the extended
detention portion of the detention basin to assist in infiltration in
accordance with the following criteria:
   A.   The extended detention volume shall be discharged at a rate no greater
than that required to empty the calculated extended detention volume within
five (5) days of the storm event.
   B.   No subsurface drainage pipe shall be located within ten feet (10') of
drainage pipes directly connected to the detention basin.
   C.   For purposes of meeting the maximum subsurface drainage discharge
requirements, flow control orifices and weirs may be used.
   D.   All design extended detention volume shall be provided above the
seasonal high ground water table or the invert elevation of the ground water
control system.
   E.   Farm field tile shall not be considered a subsurface drainage system.
(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-4-6: SITE RUNOFF STORAGE FACILITY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
Storage facilities shall be designed and constructed with the following
characteristics:
   A.   The site runoff storage facility shall provide one foot (1') of
freeboard above the design high water elevation.
   B.   The storage facilities shall be accessible and easily maintained. Side
slopes above the NWL shall not exceed four to one (4:1) (horizontal to
vertical) under any circumstances. For storage facilities with a bounce of
greater than four feet (4') the maximum side slope shall not exceed five to one
(5:1) (horizontal to vertical). For industrial or commercial areas that do not
adjoin schools, residential, or planned residential areas the administrator may
approve four to one (4:1) side slopes for bounces up to six feet (6'). The
administrator may require that access roads or paths on the top of berms shall
be provided with an H10 design load rating and meeting village design criteria.
   C.   Storage facilities shall facilitate sedimentation and catchment of
floating material. Unless specifically approved by the administrator, concrete
lined low flow ditches shall not be used in detention basins.
   D.   Storage facilities shall minimize impacts of storm water runoff on
water quality by incorporating best management practices.
   E.   Storage facilities shall maximize the normal flow distance between

Compliance with the requirements of this section shall be construed as
compliance with this chapter for the above land uses and no further regulation
under this chapter will apply. Any other land use, including greenhouses,
nurseries, container grown plants, equestrian facilities, the sale of
agricultural products to the public or where commercial activities involving
the new construction of gravel or paved parking facilities or buildings whose
aggregate area is twenty five thousand (25,000) square feet or more are
required to comply with all applicable sections of this chapter. (Ord. 947, 3-
20-2007)
6-2B-5-1: CONSERVATION PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
To comply with this section, landowners shall practice conservation planning
whose product shall be a management system, which addresses site runoff, soil
erosion and sediment control, surface and subsurface drainage. Any acreage with
a signed and approved NRCS conservation plan is exempt from the requirements of
this section and this chapter.
Applicable approved practices include:
   A.   Vegetated grass waterways,
   B.   Contour buffer strips,
   C.   Critical area planting and cover crops,

approved by the Will County NRCS district conservationist or the Will County
agricultural administrator.
The performance standard for conservation planning shall be a management system
which will develop a set of field practices which will reduce the calculated
actual soil loss to the "tolerable soil loss" (T) as calculated by the revised
universal soil loss equation for the actual site conditions. Cropland tillage
and resource management methods shall be consistent with the technical guide
notice IL-108 and shall be considered evidence of compliance with the "T"
performance standard. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-5-2: DRAINAGE PRACTICES, REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN CRITERIA:
Drainage for agricultural purposes shall be consistent with those practices
identified as appropriate for "good husbandry" given the soil types, slopes and
crops. An agricultural drainage system may consist of both subsurface drainage
systems and surface drainage systems. Where active drainage districts maintain
drainage systems, they shall be consulted on surface and subsurface drainage
within the district boundaries. Requirements applying to subsurface and surface
drainage systems shall be as follows:
   A.   Subsurface Drainage Systems: Drain tile systems shall be maintained and
constructed in accordance with subsurface drainage recommendations for the
appropriate soil drainage group as specified by the Illinois drainage guide,
University of Illinois extension service circular no. 1226. Surface inlets into
the subsurface drainage system shall be allowed only to maintain good
husbandry. Where their use cannot be practicably avoided due to topography,
they shall be installed using flow controls such as orifices and perforated
risers with gravel filters and/or vegetative filters.
   B.   Surface Drainage Systems: Surface drainage systems shall be maintained
and constructed in accordance with surface drainage recommendations for the
appropriate soil drainage group as specified by the Illinois drainage guide,
University of Illinois extension service circular no. 1226. Surface drainage
systems shall be built with geotechnically stable slopes and the surface when
applicable shall be further stabilized utilizing the establishment of cool and
warm season grass mixes as identified in field office technical guide (Illinois
108).
   C.   Buffer Strips: Open channels with a definable bed and banks shall use
buffer strips in order to reduce the amount of erosion occurring from the
conveyed flows as well as to help filter the runoff from the site into the
waterway. Buffer strips shall be a minimum of fifteen feet (15') wide from the
top of bank except where smaller widths are necessary due to site limitations
and when approved by the administrator.
   D.   Agricultural Drainage Systems: Agricultural drainage systems shall also
comply with all regulations regarding wetlands as enforced by federal, state,
and local agencies. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-5-3: SEDIMENT CONTROL FOR OPEN CHANNELS:
All open channel drainage systems shall maintain practices adjacent to the open
outlet channel that will reduce the transportation of sediment off site. Runoff
from agricultural fields must pass through a sediment control system prior to
discharge into the open channel conveyance system. Approved sediment control
systems may consist of the following:
   A.   Vegetated buffer zones planted with permanent grasses appropriate for
soil stabilization and filtering;
   B.   Grade control structures for overfall stabilization;
   C.   Sediment traps adjacent to the stream channel;

(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2B-5-4: MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS:
Agricultural drainage systems shall be maintained so as to convey the expected
flows for good drainage practices. The existing agricultural surface drainage
systems shall not be enlarged unless such enlargement is consistent with all
other sections of this section
6-2B-5. Maintenance and construction of subsurface drainage systems will not be
subject to the requirements of other sections of this chapter except as they
are regulated by other agencies. Maintenance projects by legally functioning
drainage districts on existing agricultural drainage systems will not be
subject to further permitting requirements under this chapter except as they
relate to the jurisdiction of other agencies. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)

6-2C-1: SITE PLANNING:
Sediment and erosion control planning shall be part of the initial site
planning process. In planning the development of the site, the applicant shall
consider the susceptibility of existing soils to erosion and topographic
features such as steep slopes and stream corridors which must be protected to
reduce the amount of sediment and erosion which occurs. Where appropriate,
existing vegetation shall be protected from disturbance during construction by
fencing or other means. In the planning process the applicant shall also
address the following:
   A.   For projects that involve phased construction, existing land cover for
those areas not under current development shall be addressed. If existing land
cover does not consist of an appropriate ground cover then these phases shall
be planted temporarily to reduce erosion from idle land.
   B.   In planning the sediment and erosion control strategy, preference shall
be given to reducing erosion rather than controlling sediment. In order to
accomplish this the plan must carefully consider the construction sequence of
the phases so that the amount of land area exposed to erosive forces is the
minimum consistent with completing construction. In no case shall more than
twenty (20) acres of ground cover be disturbed at one time without permanent or
temporary stabilization unless authorized by the administrator.
   C.   Storm water detention basins shall be constructed as early in the
construction process as practicable. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-2: STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS:
   A.   Specifications for erosion control measures shall be in accordance with
the "Illinois Urban Manual" (1995 or latest edition). Sediment and erosion
control planning shall be in accordance with "Procedures And Standards For
Urban Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (revised July 1988)
by the urban committee of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water
Conservation Districts (the "green book") chapters 1 through 5. Where the
"Illinois Urban Manual" supersedes sections of the green book, the "Illinois
Urban Manual" shall prevail.
   B.   All projects that will result in the development of one acre or more,
except for agricultural projects regulated solely under section
6-2B-5 of this chapter, shall be required to obtain coverage under an
appropriate NPDES permit. The permittee shall certify to the village that all
required permits, plans and inspections have been prepared and maintained in
accordance with the NPDES permit. Specifically the permittee shall prepare, and
adhere to, a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) prepared for the
development project that shall meet all the conditions in the permit for
SWPPPs. A copy of such plan shall be maintained on the construction site at all
times that workers are present, and a copy of the permit, SWPPP and/or
inspection logs, shall be provided to the village upon request. Failure to
obtain an NPDES permit or to comply with the conditions of an NPDES permit for
the construction activity shall constitute a violation of this chapter. (Ord.
947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The runoff from disturbed areas shall not leave the development site
without first passing through sediment control facilities. This requirement
shall apply to all phases of construction and shall include an ongoing process
of implementation of measures and maintenance of those measures during both the
construction season and any construction shutdown periods.
   B.   The smallest practical area shall be exposed for the shortest practical
time during development. However in no case shall more than twenty (20) acres
be exposed at one time on a development unless a larger area is approved by the
administrator.
   C.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected whenever possible.
Areas within twenty five feet (25') of natural watercourses, lakes, ponds and
wetlands should be left undisturbed whenever possible.
   D.   All applicants for developments of one acre or more shall submit an
application for an NPDES permit or a notice of intent (NOI) to be covered under
a general NPDES permit. A copy of any storm water pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) required by such permit shall be provided to the village prior to
commencement of development activities and a copy shall be kept on the
development site at all times. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-4: EXTENDED CONSTRUCTION SHUTDOWN PERIODS:
The condition of the construction site for the winter shutdown period shall
address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall growing season so
that slopes and other bare earth areas may be stabilized with temporary and/or
permanent vegetative cover. All open areas that are to remain idle throughout
the winter shall receive temporary erosion control measures including temporary
seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanketing prior to the end of the
fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of the growing
season must incorporate soil stabilization measures that do not rely on
vegetative cover such as erosion control blankets and heavy mulching. In no
case shall requirements less than those required by IEPA NPDES permit ILR10
apply to projects disturbing more than one acre. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-5: HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
In the hydraulic and hydrologic design of major erosion control measures (those
of which the tributary drainage area is greater than 3 acres) such as sediment
basins and traps, diversions, and the like, the design frequency shall be
commensurate with the risk of the design event being exceeded. The following
design frequencies shall be regarded as minimum design frequencies for the
construction period:
   A.   For those projects whose construction period is less than six (6)
months then the storm event having a fifty percent (50%) chance (2-year event)
of being exceeded in any year shall be used for design purposes;
   B.   For those projects whose construction period is greater than six (6)
months but less than one year, the design frequency for major sediment basins
shall be a rainfall event with a twenty percent (20%) (5-year event) chance of
being exceeded in any one year; and
   C.   For those construction projects expected to last more than one year
major sediment basins shall be designed for a rainfall event with a ten percent
(10%) (10-year event) chance of being exceeded in any one year. (Ord. 947, 3-
20-2007)
6-2C-6: "AS NEEDED" PRACTICES ON THE PLANS:
The sediment and erosion control plan shall designate a series of practices
which shall be implemented either at the direction of the permittee or the
permittee's representative on site or at the direction of the administrator
should an inspection of the site indicate a deficiency in soil and sediment
erosion control measures. As a minimum, these measures shall include the
following:
   A.   Sedimentation basins;
   B.   Sediment traps;
   C.   Diversion swales;
   D.   Silt fences;
   E.   Temporary seeding;
   F.   Mulching;

to stripping existing vegetation or mass grading shall be indicated on the
plans.
   C.   Permanent stabilization measures shall be indicated on a separate plan.
   D.   The expected 2-year and 10-year runoff rates from all off site areas
draining into the site shall be identified on the plan.
   E.   Methods for conveying flows through the site during construction shall
be indicated. These methods must include the temporary and permanent
stabilization measures to be used to reduce velocity and erosion from flow
through the construction zone.
   F.   A maintenance schedule of each measure used shall be indicated on the
plan. As a minimum, all sediment and erosion control measures on site shall be
inspected weekly and also by the applicant's designee or after a one-half inch
(1/2") or greater rainfall event and any required repairs shall be made to keep
these measures functional as designed. All repairs and modifications shall be
reviewed by the administrator or his/her designee. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-8: CONVEYANCE OF OFF SITE FLOW:
To the extent practicable, proposed ditches and waterways which are to convey
off site flows through the site shall be stabilized upon construction. Where
new waterways are constructed they shall be stabilized to the extent
practicable prior to their use to convey flood flows. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-9: STOCKPILES:
Stockpiles of soil and other erodable or floatable building materials (sand,
limestone, etc.) shall not be located in floodplains, overflow routes or areas
subject to frequent inundation. If a stockpile is to remain in place for more
than three (3) days, then sediment and erosion control shall be provided for
the stockpile. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-10: STORM SEWER INLETS:
Storm sewer inlets, catch basins, and manholes with open lid grates shall be
protected with manufactured filtration devices developed to prevent sediments
from entering the drainage system. Silt screens, hay bales, and filter fabrics
under storm grates are not allowed. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2C-11: CONSTRUCTION DEWATERING:
Water pumped or which is otherwise discharged from the site during construction
dewatering shall be filtered and a means provided to reduce erosion. (Ord. 947,
3-20-2007)
6-2C-12: PROTECTION OF PUBLIC/PRIVATE ROADWAYS:
Graveled roads, access drives, parking areas of sufficient width and length,
and vehicle wash down facilities, if necessary, shall be provided to prevent
soils from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any soil tracked onto
a public or private roadway shall be removed before the end of each workday or
sooner as directed by the authority maintaining the roadway. (Ord. 947, 3-20-
2007)
6-2C-13: TEMPORARY STREAM CROSSINGS:
Temporary stream crossings of intermittent and perennial streams used only for
and during construction shall be designed to convey a 2-year flood (minimum) or
other flood event approved by the administrator without overtopping unless a
more frequent design event is allowed by the administrator. The entire crossing
shall be designed to withstand hydrodynamic forces and erosive forces up to the
base flood event without washing out. Ephemeral streams may be crossed at
temporary at grade crossings provided that the crossing point is stabilized
with materials resistive to the erosive forces produced by runoff from the
upstream drainage area, and the design is approved by the administrator.
Temporary stream crossings shall be removed upon completion of construction
activities. All temporary stream crossings shall be completely removed and the
stream restored to its preconstruction condition upon completion of
construction. Restoration shall incorporate appropriate vegetation consistent
with the adjacent existing vegetation prior to construction or in accordance
with a restoration plan approved by the administrator. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)

6-2D-1: FLOODPLAINS AND FLOODWAYS:
This article sets forth requirements for developments within floodplains and
floodways. In addition, developments in the SFHA draining more than one square
mile with no designated floodway must meet IDNR/OWR Illinois Administrative
Code part 3700 rules. Projects which meet all the requirements and conditions
to be considered permitted under IDNR/OWR Statewide, regional and general
permits, and are not in designated floodways, shall be considered to have met
the technical requirements of this section. References to IDNR/OWR permits or
approvals in this section shall be construed as "their designee" where a
portion or all of their authority has been delegated.
All development shall meet the requirements set forth in table 2, "Summary of
Applicable Ordinance Section for Development in Floodplains", attached to the
ordinance codified herein. The table is intended only as a guide to indicate
the applicable ordinance sections for development in floodplains. (Ord. 947, 3-
20-2007)
6-2D-2: FLOODPLAIN, REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN, BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) AND
REGULATORY FLOODWAY LOCATIONS:
The BFE shall be delineated on the site topography map to establish the
regulatory floodplain area limits for regulation under this chapter. Regulatory
floodplains shall be delineated on the site map from the current FEMA FIRM,
FBFM or LOMR and include those areas of the SFHA which are not regulatory
floodplains. Each community, whether certified or not, remains responsible for
maintaining the effective FIS and a list of FIRM panels for their respective
communities.
   A.   The BFE shall be:
      1.   The elevation of the 100-year profile corresponding to the location
of the development as indicated in the flood profiles in the flood insurance
studies of Will County prepared by FEMA dated February 15, 2019, and such
amendments as may be prepared from time to time; or
      2.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
floodplain delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or
depth) delineated on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Will County and
dated February 15, 2019, and such amendments or revisions to such study and
maps as may be prepared from time to time; or (Ord. 1288-19, 2-5-2019)
      3.   a. When no BFE information exists and the upstream tributary
drainage area is six hundred forty (640) acres or greater, the BFE shall be
determined using a site specific floodplain study by a professional engineer
using appropriate hydrologic and hydraulic models as follows acceptable to FEMA
and IDNR/OWR.
         b.   Where a channel has a tributary drainage area of six hundred
forty (640) acres or more, the above analyses shall be submitted to the IDNR/
OWR for concurrent approval.
         c.   For a nonriverine regulatory floodplain, the historic flood of
record plus three feet (3') may be used for the BFE instead of performing a
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic study for developments of less than forty
(40) acres, at the discretion of the Administrator. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
      4.   For floodplains that are not regulatory, are not draining more than
six hundred forty (640) acres, and with no BFE determined, the Administrator
may require a site specific floodplain study for the purpose of establishing an
FPE for the development. A site specific study is required for all developments
of forty (40) acres or more that have regulatory floodplain on any portion of
the site.
The location of the regulatory floodway shall be as delineated on the
Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Will County prepared by FEMA and dated
February 15, 2019, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as
may be prepared from time to time. The location of the regulatory floodway
boundary shall be scaled onto the site plan using references common to both the
map and the plan (typically the centerlines of adjacent roadways). Where an
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory
floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted. Note: If an area of the site
is located in the regulatory floodway that is higher than the BFE, that area is
subject to the floodway standards of section
6-2D-5 of this article, including the appropriate use criteria, until such time
as a LOMR is received from the IDNR/OWR and FEMA. (Ord. 1288-19, 2-5-2019)
   B.   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations in the regulatory
floodway are as follows:
      1.   The flood profiles, flows, and data in the current effective FIS
must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to
be in error or conditions have changed, FEMA and IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
The Director and Administrator shall be copied on all related correspondence.
      2.   If the BFE at the site of the proposed development is affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the
proposed development shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section
with the receiving stream at both the normal water and BFEs.
      3.   If the applicant is informed by IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream or upstream restrictive bridge or culvert is
scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control
project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the
next five (5) years, the proposed development shall be analyzed and shown to
meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the
expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control
project is built, removed or modified as applicable.
      4.   If the appropriate use will result in a change in the regulatory
floodway location or a change in the BFE, the applicant shall submit the
information required to be issued a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)
to IDNR/OWR and FEMA. A public notice inviting public comment on the proposed
change in the BFE or location of the regulatory floodway will be issued by
IDNR/OWR or its designee before a CLOMR is issued. Filling, grading, dredging
or excavating may take place upon issuance of a conditional approval from IDNR/
OWR and the Administrator. No further development activities shall take place
in the existing or proposed floodplain until a letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA unless such activities meet all the requirements of section
6-2D-3 of this article. The Director shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
      5.   For those circumstances listed below and located in a regulatory
floodway, the following information shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their
review and concurrence:
         a.   Analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge, culvert
crossings and roadway approaches.
         b.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge, culvert
crossing or approach road is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile.
         c.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage.
         d.   Stormwater management permits to local units of government for
regulatory floodway and floodplain development.
         e.   IDNR/OWR will issue permits for any IDNR/OWR projects, dams,
etc., all other State, Federal or WCSMC or certified community projects. (Ord.
947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-3: GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following general performance standards are applicable to all development
in a regulatory floodplain. The standards of this section apply except when
superseded by more stringent requirements in the subsequent sections:
   A.   No development except as allowed in section
 6-2D-7 of this article shall be allowed in the regulatory floodplain that
singularly or cumulatively creates an increase in flood stage or velocity off
site, or a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or
velocity on site or threat to public health, safety and welfare.
   B.   For all projects involving a channel modification, fill, stream
maintenance or a levee, the flood conveyance and storage capacity of the
regulatory floodplain shall not be reduced.
   C.   If the proposed development would result in a change in the regulatory
floodplain or BFE, the applicant shall obtain a LOMA/LOMR from FEMA. If the
development will result in an increase in the BFE of more than one foot (1') at
any location a CLOMR must be obtained before any work is performed in the
regulatory floodplain. No buildings may be built in the existing or proposed
regulatory floodplain until the LOMA/LOMR receives concurrence from IDNR/OWR
and is issued by FEMA unless the building meets all the building protection
standards (section
6-2D-3-2 of this article). Proposed changes to the regulatory floodway
delineation and the BFE must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence.
   D.   If the development is located in a public body of water, as defined by
IDNR/OWR, a permit must also be received from IDNR/OWR.
   E.   Prior to the commencement of any construction, modification or removal
of a dam the developer shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or letter
indicating a permit is not required.
   F.   For public flood control projects, the floodplain management standards
will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR and WCSMC
that each of the following conditions are met:
      1.   Demonstrate by hydraulic and hydrologic modeling that the proposed
project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights
outside the project site or demonstrate that any increases will be contained in
easements for all flood events up to and including the base flood event.
      2.   Demonstrate that the project will be operated and maintained by a
public agency.
      3.   Demonstrate that the project will reduce flood damage to an existing
building or structure.
These standards do not preclude the design, engineering, construction or
financing, in whole or in part of a public flood control project by persons who
are not public agencies.
   G.   Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, planned unit
developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home park and additions to
subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
data and floodway delineations. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-3-1: PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION STANDARDS:
   A.   New and replacement water supply systems, wells and sanitary sewer
lines may be permitted if all manholes or other aboveground openings located
below the FPE are watertight.
   B.   New or replacement on site waste disposal systems are not allowed in
the regulatory floodplain within village limits.
   C.   New, substantially improved or replacement wastewater treatment plants
shall have watertight openings for those openings located below the FPE. Such
facilities should be located to avoid impairment to the facility or
contamination of floodwaters during the base flood.
   D.   No developments in the SFHA shall include the locating or storing of
hazardous materials, buoyant materials, solid wastes, fertilizers, pesticides
or other toxic materials or potential pollutants. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-3-2: BUILDING PROTECTION STANDARDS:
The building protection standards apply to all buildings located in the
regulatory floodplain; however, it should be noted that most new and
replacement buildings are not appropriate uses of the regulatory floodway.
   A.   The lowest floor including basements of all new residential structures,
substantially improved structures and additions shall be elevated up to at
least the FPE. An attached garage for a structure must be elevated up to at
least 0.1 foot above the BFE.
      1.   If placed on fill, the top of the fill for the residential structure
shall be above the FPE. The top of fill for an attached garage shall be at
least 0.1 foot above the BFE. The fill shall be placed at that elevation for a
distance of twenty feet (20') out from the building unless the building design
is certified by a registered structural engineer to be protected from damages
due to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill shall not settle below the
FPE for the residential structure and not below 0.1 foot above the base flood
for an attached garage, and shall be adequately protected against erosion,
scour and differential settlement. The building shall meet all of the
requirements of FEMA technical bulletin 10-01.
      2.   If elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation, the
building's supporting structure must be permanently open to floodwaters and not
subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The permanent
openings shall be no more than one foot (1') above existing grade, and consist
of a minimum of two (2) openings. The openings must have a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding below the BFE. The lowest inside grade must match the
lowest existing outside grade adjacent to the structure. The foundation and
supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and
adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces
such as current, waves, ice and floating debris. All areas below the FPE shall
be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor
(including basement) for the residential structure and all electrical, heating,
ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall
be located at or above the FPE. An attached garage must be elevated to at least
0.1 foot above the BFE. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines,
submersible pumps and other waterproofed service facilities may be located
below the FPE. No area below the FPE shall be used for storage.
   B.   The lowest floor including the basement of all new or substantially
improved nonresidential buildings shall be elevated at least to the FPE as
described above or be structurally dry floodproofed to at least the FPE. A
nonresidential building may be structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu of
elevation) provided that a professional engineer or registered structural
engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed
below the FPE and the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight
and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood. The building design
shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy and impacts from debris or
ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and
without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms, floodwalls and
similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this
subsection.)
   C.   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed on a site
for more than one hundred eighty (180) days shall be at or above the FPE and
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in
accordance with the Illinois manufactured home tie down code (77 Illinois
administrative code 870 1999) as amended.
   D.   Accessory structures, such as toolsheds and detached garages which are
not substantial improvements on an existing single-family lot, may be
constructed with the lowest floor below the FPE in accordance with the
following criteria:
      1.   The building shall not be used for human habitation.
      2.   All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with waterproof
material. Structures located in a regulatory floodway shall meet the floodway
standards in section
6-2D-5 of this article.
      3.   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation and movement.
      4.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be
elevated or floodproofed to the FPE.
      5.   The building shall be no greater than six hundred (600) square feet
in floor size, and be valued at less than seven thousand five hundred dollars
($7,500.00). The building shall meet the permanent opening criteria of
subsection A2 of this section.
      6.   The building shall be used only for the storage of vehicles or tools
and may not contain basements or other rooms, workshops, greenhouses or similar
uses.
Accessory structures that do not meet all of the above criteria may be
constructed if they are dry floodproofed or elevated at least one-half (1/2) of
one foot (1') above the BFE. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-3-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other disaster may be
restored unless the damage meets or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its market
value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to the building
protection standards of this chapter. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-4: COMPENSATORY STORAGE VOLUME STANDARDS:
The following standards apply within the regulatory floodplain or, for sites
draining more than six hundred forty (640) acres, the limits of the delineated
floodplain as accepted by the administrator:
   A.   Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage volume will be required
for development in a riverine regulatory floodplain and shall be at least equal
to the regulatory floodplain flood storage volume displaced. The storage volume
displaced below the existing 10-year frequency flood elevation must be replaced
below the proposed 10-year frequency flood elevation. The storage volume
displaced above the 10-year existing frequency flood elevation must be replaced
above the proposed 10-year frequency flood elevation. Additional storage of not
less than fifty percent (50%) of the net volume displaced shall be provided
based upon the total volume filled below the BFE. The additional fifty percent
(50%) need not be hydraulically equivalent. The volume of storage lost shall be
calculated based on the existing BFE and the volume of compensatory storage
shall be calculated based upon the final with project BFE.
   B.   Compensatory storage volume for development in a nonriverine regulatory
floodplain area that is also adjacent to a lake shall be equal to the storage
volume displaced. Additional storage of not less than fifty percent (50%) of
the net volume displaced shall be provided. The volume of storage lost shall be
calculated based on the existing BFE and the volume of compensatory storage
shall be calculated based upon the final with project BFE.
   C.   Compensatory storage volume requirements for development in a
nonriverine regulatory floodplain that is not adjacent to a lake shall be
replaced in accordance with the requirements for the loss of depressional
storage in section
6-2B-2-7 of this chapter.
   D.   The hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage areas shall be
designed to drain freely and openly to the channel and shall be located
adjacent to the development. This standard does not apply to nonriverine
regulatory floodplain.
   E.   A recorded covenant running with the land is required to maintain the
compensatory storage volume in areas modified to provide compensatory storage
volume. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-5: FLOODWAY STANDARDS:
The only development in a regulatory floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses which will not cause an increase in flood heights or
velocities for all flood events up to and including the base flood. Only those
appropriate uses listed below will be allowed in the regulatory floodway.
Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new
structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, fencing (including
landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials
except as specifically defined below as an appropriate use. If the development
is proposed for the regulatory floodway portion of the regulatory floodplain,
the following standards apply in addition to the standards for the regulatory
floodplain:
   A.   Only the construction, modification, repair or replacement of the
following appropriate uses will be allowed in the regulatory floodway:
      1.   Public flood control structures and private improvements relating to
the control of drainage and flooding of existing buildings, erosion, water
quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      2.   Structures or facilities relating to functionally water dependent
uses such as additions, modifications, and improvements to existing wastewater
treatment plants (except for additions to habitable structures on the site) and
facilities and improvements relating to recreational boating (this does not
include new wastewater treatment plants);
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
      4.   Underground and overhead utilities;
      5.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields, open pavilions,
gazebos and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent
open when viewed from any 1 direction) built parallel to the direction of flood
flows;
      6.   Boathouses or other nonhabitable structures without sanitary
facilities that are accessory to existing buildings and will not block flood
flows nor reduce regulatory floodway storage;
      7.   Bridges, culverts and associated roadways, sidewalks and railways,
required for crossing the regulatory floodway or for access to other
appropriate uses in the regulatory floodway and any modification thereto;
      8.   Reserved;
      9.   Regulatory floodway grading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a channel;
      10.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or the construction of floodwalls or berms around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the
floodwall or berm shall be no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior
wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered to be substantial
improvements to the structure;
      11.   The repair, replacement or reconstruction of a damaged building,
provided, that none of the outside dimensions of the building are increased
and, provided, that the cost of repair is less than fifty percent (50%) of the
building's value before it was damaged. When damage is fifty percent (50%) or
more (a substantial improvement), the activity shall conform to section
6-2D-3-2 of this article;
      12.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the BFE and which will not block
flood flows. These modifications include fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios
and second story additions. No enclosed floor areas may be built on stilts. The
modifications may not singularly or cumulatively equal fifty percent (50%) or
more of the building's market value.
   B.   Additions or changes to the above list of appropriate uses must be
approved by the committee prior to the adoption by the county board and IDNR/
OWR.
   C.   All development in the regulatory floodway shall require a permit from
IDNR/OWR and must be in accordance with all provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible,
provided, that the proposed project meets the following engineering and
mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans,
calculations and data prepared and signed by a professional engineer:
      1.   All effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the
development of appropriate uses, other than bridge or culvert crossings or on
stream structures or dams, shall be replaced for all flood events up to and
including the base flood.
      2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used to
determine transition sections in calculations of effective regulatory floodway
conveyance:
         a.   Flowing water will expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
         b.   Flowing water will contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
         c.   Flowing water will not expand or contract faster than one foot
(1') vertical for every ten feet (10') of flooded stream length.
         d.   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
         e.   Transition sections must be used to determine the effective
conveyance areas on adjacent properties.
      3.   Development of an appropriate use will not result in an increase in
the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage. However, in the
case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
   E.   In the case of on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water during normal or flood flows, the increase in flood stage when compared
to existing conditions for all storm events up to and including the base flood
event shall be contained within recorded easements or the channel banks. A dam
safety permit or letter indicating a dam safety permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for such structures.
   F.   IDNR/OWR will issue permits for all floodway projects including IDNR/
OWR projects, dams, etc., and for all other state, WCSMC, or certified
community projects.
   G.   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be
demonstrated that:
      1.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would
accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body
of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization,
floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a
stream side buffer strip of greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish
and wildlife habitat;
      2.   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
      3.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed
in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of
the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match
as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified,
restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into
channel modification design, where practical.
         b.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the
upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
         c.   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible.
Removal of stream side (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of
the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects
of the vegetation.
         d.   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for construction of the channel.
         e.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper
than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practical. Natural
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         f.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
         g.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established where
appropriate.
         h.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the
modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
         i.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
         j.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel
enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated
by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as
part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
         k.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control project,
there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification; and
      4.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-6: RIVERINE FLOODPLAIN:
These standards apply to riverine regulatory floodplains without a regulatory
floodway.
The applicant shall obtain approval from IDNR/OWR for all development any
portion of which is located partially or completely within the regulatory
floodplain (without a delineated regulatory floodway) with a tributary drainage
area of six hundred forty (640) acres or more.
   A.   The development shall not singularly or cumulatively result in an
obstruction of flood flows or potential flood damages outside the site due to
an increase in flood heights, velocities, or loss of floodplain area storage.
   B.   A professional engineer shall submit a study that demonstrates one of
the following:
      1.   Determine a floodway which meets the definition of a regulatory
floodway and demonstrate that the proposed development meets the floodway
standards in section
6-2D-5 of this article, or
      2.   Determine a BFE and demonstrate that the proposed development will
maintain the existing conditions conveyance, will not increase flood
velocities, will not increase flood profiles and will compensate for any lost
floodplain storage. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-7: BRIDGE AND CULVERT STANDARDS:
These standards are for the reconstruction, modification or new construction of
bridges, culvert crossings and roadway approaches located in the regulatory
floodplain.
   A.   A proposed new structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the base flood event unless contained
within the channel banks or recorded easements. The evaluation must be
submitted to the IDNR/OWR for review and a permit obtained.
   B.   If the proposed new structure will increase upstream flood stages
greater than 0.1 foot, the applicant must contact IDNR/OWR for a dam safety
permit or waiver. The director shall be copied on all related correspondence.
   C.   Lost regulatory floodplain storage must be replaced as required in
section
 6-2D-4, "Compensatory Storage Volume Standards", of this article except that
artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind an
existing bridge or culvert crossing shall not be required to be replaced,
provided, no flood damage will be incurred downstream.
   D.   Velocity increases must be mitigated by use of appropriate measures to
avoid scour, erosion and sedimentation at the structure.
   E.   For modification or replacement of existing structures, the existing
structure must first be evaluated in accordance with IDNR/OWR rules (17
Illinois administrative code part 3708) to determine if the existing structure
is a source of flood damage. If the structure is a source of flood damage, the
applicant's engineer shall submit justification to allow the damage to continue
and evaluate the feasibility of relieving the structure's impact. Modifications
or replacement structures shall not increase flood stages (0.0 feet) compared
to the existing condition for all flood events up to and including the base
flood event. The evaluation must be submitted to IDNR/OWR, for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued. The director shall be copied on all
related correspondence.
   F.   If any work is proposed in, near or over a public body of water, a
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR.
   G.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing
the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required.
   H.   Construction vehicles shall cross streams by the means of existing
bridges or culverts. Where an existing crossing is not available, a temporary
crossing that has been issued a permit or waiver by IDNR/OWR shall be
constructed in which:
      1.   The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above existing grade.
      2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the
water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall.
      3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet
(2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
      4.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one
year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by the
administrator. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-8: STREAM AND WETLANDS PROTECTION:
6-2D-8-1: AUTHORITY:
The lowland conservancy overlay district is adopted by the mayor and board of
trustees of the village of Manhattan, Illinois, under the authority of the
Illinois Revised Statutes, chapter 34, paragraphs 3151 et seq., 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-1 et seq. The village of Manhattan, Illinois, also
asserts its jurisdiction over all isolated wetlands within the village
corporate limits and facilities planning areas that were formerly under the
jurisdiction of the U.S. army corps of engineers prior to January 9, 2000.
(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-8-2: TITLE:
This section
6-2D-8 shall be known and may be cited as the village of Manhattan LOWLAND
CONSERVANCY OVERLAY DISTRICT ORDINANCE. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-8-3: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose and intent of this section
6-2D-8 to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and
future residents of village of Manhattan and downstream drainage areas by
providing for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance, and use of
village of Manhattan watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplain and wetland areas.
All work to be done in a lowland conservancy district will require a permit
from the army corps of engineers. The responsibility for obtaining the permit
is by the applicant. If requested by the village, a sign-off from the army
corps of engineers will be required if the site appears to be near a wetland
area. Absolutely no work shall be undertaken until the administrator has
received an approved permit by the army corps of engineers.
This section
6-2D-8 is more specifically adopted:
   A.   To prevent flood damage by preserving storm and flood water storage
capacity (including depressional storage);
   B.   To maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, floodplains,
ponds, lakes, wetlands, and ground water by storing and providing for
infiltration of wet period runoff in floodplains and wetlands, and releasing it
slowly to the stream to maintain in-stream flow;
   C.   To manage storm water runoff and maintain natural runoff conveyance
systems, and minimize the need for major storm sewer construction and
drainageway modification;
   D.   To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments and
attached pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds before they drain into
streams or wetlands, and by maintaining the natural pollutant assimilating
capabilities of streams, floodplains and wetlands;
   E.   To protect shorelines and stream banks from soil erosion, using natural
means and materials wherever possible;
   F.   To protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding grounds;
   G.   To protect wildlife habitat;
   H.   To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic, or scientific
interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species;
   I.   To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing areas;
and
   J.   To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of life of
the village of Manhattan which depends in part on an adequate quality of water,
a pleasing natural environment, and recreational opportunities in proximity to
the village of Manhattan.
In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this section
 6-2D-8, the village of Manhattan hereby designates the lowland conservancy
overlay district that shall be considered as an overlay to the zoning districts
created by the village of Manhattan zoning ordinances as amended. Any proposed
development activity within the district must obtain a site development permit
as approved by the governing body of village of Manhattan. See section
6-2D-8-4 of this article. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-8-4: SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
To ensure that proposed development activity can be carried out in a manner
which is compatible and harmonious with the natural amenities of the lowland
conservancy overlay district and with surrounding land uses, a request for a
site development permit for such development activity must be submitted for
approval by the administrator.
   A.   Findings: No site development permit shall be issued unless the village
of Manhattan finds that:
      1.   The development will not detrimentally affect or destroy natural
features such as ponds, streams, wetlands, and forested areas, nor impair their
natural functions, but will preserve and incorporate such features into the
development's site;
      2.   The location of natural features and the site's topography have been
considered in the designing and siting of all physical improvements;
      3.   Adequate assurances have been received that the clearing of the site
of topsoil, trees, and other natural features will not occur before the
commencement of building operations; only those areas approved for the
placement of physical improvements may be cleared;
      4.   The development will not reduce the natural retention storage
capacity of any watercourse, nor increase the magnitude and volume of flooding
at other locations; and that in addition, the development will not increase
stream velocities; and
      5.   The soil and subsoil conditions are suitable for excavation and site
preparation, and the drainage is designed to prevent erosion and
environmentally deleterious surface runoff.
There shall be no development, including the immediate or future clearing or
removal of natural ground cover and/or trees, within the lowland conservancy
overlay district for any purpose, unless a site development permit is granted
subject to the provisions of this section
6-2D-8 or the provisions of the village of Manhattan zoning ordinance.
Dumping, filling, mining, excavating, dredging, or transferring of any earth
material within the district is prohibited unless a site development permit is
granted.
No ponds or impoundments shall be created nor other alterations or improvements
shall be allowed in the district for recreational uses, storm water management,
flood control, agricultural uses or as scenic features unless a site
development permit is granted.
   B.   Application For Permit: Application for a site development permit shall
be made by the owner of the property, or his/her authorized agent, to the
village of Manhattan, on a form furnished for that purpose. Each application
shall bear the name(s) and address(es) of the owner or developer of the site
and of any consulting firm retained by the applicant together with the name of
the applicant's principal contact at such firm, and shall be accompanied by a
filing fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) unless the application is part of a
subdivision review where other fees take priority. The applicant further agrees
to reimburse the village for any outside review engineering fees, incurred by
the village, in addition to the filing fees. Each application shall include
certification that any land clearing, construction, or development involving
the movement of earth shall be in accordance with the plans approved upon
issuance of the permit.
   C.   Submissions: Each application for a site development permit shall be
accompanied by the following information: general provisions, site development
plan, geologic and soil report, drainage control plan, site grading and
excavation plan, landscape plan, justification for watercourse relocation and
minor modifications, stream modification/relocation plan, channel and bank
armoring, culverts, on stream impoundments, and an impact assessment.
   D.   Review And Approval: Each application for a site development permit
shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures:
      1.   The village of Manhattan will review each application for a site
development permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this
section
6-2D-8. The village of Manhattan may also refer any application to the Will/
South Cook soil and water conservation district and/or any other local
government or public agency within whose jurisdiction the site is located for
review and comments. Within thirty (30) days after receiving an application,
the village of Manhattan shall in writing: a) approve the permit application,
if it is found to be in conformance with the provisions of this section 6-2D-8,
and issue the permit; b) approve the permit application subject to such
reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the
objectives of this section
6-2D-8, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or c) disapprove the
permit application, indicating the deficiencies and the procedure for
submitting a revised application and/or submission.
      2.   No site development permit shall be issued for an intended
development site unless:
         a.   The development, including, but not limited to, subdivisions and
planned unit developments, has been approved by the village of Manhattan where
applicable; or
         b.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the village of Manhattan; or
         c.   The proposed development is coordinated with any overall
development program previously approved by the village of Manhattan for the
area in which the site is situated.
   E.   Permit Exceptions: The provisions of this section
6-2D-8 shall not apply to:
      1.   Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property; when
emergency work is performed under this section
6-2D-8, the person performing it shall report the pertinent facts relating to
the work to the administrator within ten (10) days after commencement of the
work and shall thereafter obtain a site development permit and shall perform
such work as may be determined by the agency to be reasonably necessary to
correct any impairment to the watercourse, lake, pond, floodplain or wetland;
      2.   Work consisting of the operation, repair, or maintenance of any
lawful use of land existing on the date of adoption hereof;
      3.   Lands adjacent to farm ditches if:
         a.   Such lands are not adjacent to a natural stream or river; or
         b.   Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were
not streams before ditching; or
         c.   Such lands are maintained in agricultural uses without buildings
and structures.
Where farm ditches are found to contribute to adverse environmental impacts or
hazards to persons or property, the village of Manhattan may include designated
farm ditches in the district. The village of Manhattan may also require that
linings, bulkheads, dikes and culverts be removed to mitigate hazards, or that
other mitigable measures be taken, such as the maintenance of a natural
vegetation buffer strip.
   F.   Effect On Other Permits: The granting of a site development permit
under the provisions herein shall in no way affect the owner's responsibility
to obtain the approval required by any other statute, ordinance, or regulation
of any state agency or subdivision thereof, or to meet other village of
Manhattan ordinances and regulations. Where state and/or federal permits are
required, a site development permit will not be issued until they are obtained.
(Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-8-5: GENERAL PROVISIONS; AREA AFFECTED:
This section
6-2D-8 applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands
within the village of Manhattan. Streams, lakes, and ponds (including
intermittent streams) are those which are shown on the United States department
of the interior geological survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle national
wetlands inventory maps and those additional streams, lakes, and ponds
delineated on the village of Manhattan water resources management plan map
adopted as part of this section
6-2D-8. Those are hereby made a part of this section
 6-2D-8, and two (2) copies thereof shall remain on file at the village of
Manhattan administrative building for public inspection. Wetlands are those
designated by the most recent version of the U.S. army corps of engineers
manual of wetland delineation.
If new drainage courses, lakes, ponds or wetlands are created as part of a
development, the requirements for setbacks and uses within setbacks, and the
criteria for watercourse relocation and minor modification shall apply. The
district shall be amended as appropriate to include these areas.
   A.   The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District: The lowland conservancy
overlay district shall be considered as an overlay to the zoning districts
created by the village of Manhattan zoning ordinance as amended. In addition to
the requirements of this section
6-2D-8, applicants for a site development permit within the district shall meet
all requirements of the underlying zoning districts. In the event of a conflict
between the overlay district requirements and the underlying zoning district
requirements, the most restrictive requirements prevail.
   B.   District Boundary: The procedures, standards and requirements contained
in this section
6-2D-8 shall apply to all lots within wetlands and streams, and all lots lying
wholly or in part:
      1.   Within the special flood hazard area (SFHA) designated by the
federal emergency management agency (FEMA); or
      2.   Within one hundred feet (100') of the ordinary high water mark
(OHWM) of a perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high water
mark of a lake or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or
      3.   Within depressional areas serving as floodplain or storm water
storage areas, as designated on the lowland conservancy district map.
   C.   Minimum Setback Of Development Activity From Streams, Lakes,
Depressional Storage, Ponds, And Wetlands: Absolutely no development activity
(except as provided below) may occur within the minimum setback. The minimum
setback, which should be a vegetated buffer strip, preferably planted with
native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of
the area in question. The width of the buffer strip shall be as follows:
      1.   Twenty five feet (25') for a tributary length of two hundred fifty
feet (250') or less.
      2.   Fifty feet (50') for a tributary length greater than two hundred
fifty feet (250') and less than five hundred feet (500').
      3.   Seventy five feet (75') for a tributary length over five hundred
feet (500').
Note: The tributary length is the maximum length of the project limits to the
sensitive area or the length from a drainage divide to the sensitive area.
The minimum setback shall be measured between the ordinary high water mark of
streams, lakes and ponds, or the edge of wetlands, or within a designated
depressional area. In no case shall the setback be less than the boundary of
the 100-year floodway as defined by FEMA. These setback requirements do not
apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken out of the culvert as
part of development activity. If a culvert functions as a low flow culvert,
where water is intended to periodically flow over it, the setback requirements
apply.
   D.   Development Activities:
      1.   The following development activities may be permitted, subject to
issuance of a site development permit, within the minimum setback areas only
if, as a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the setback area.
Such development activities will only be approved based upon a report, prepared
by a qualified professional, which demonstrates that they will not adversely
affect water quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant habitat area;
adversely affect drainage and/or storm water retention capabilities; adversely
affect flood conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth conditions, create
erosion hazards, or be materially detrimental to any other property in the area
of the subject property or to the village of Manhattan as a whole, including
the loss of open space or scenic vistas:
         a.   Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations,
informational displays, directional signs, footbridges, observation decks, and
docks;
         b.   The maintenance, repair, replacement, and reconstruction of
existing utilities, highways and bridges, electrical transmission and
telecommunication lines, poles, and towers; and
         c.   The establishment and development of public and private parks and
recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic, natural and scientific
areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and
animal farms, wildlife preserves and public boat launching ramps.
      2.   Review of proposed development activity within the minimum setback
area will consider the following:
         a.   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the development
of public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park
shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and maintenance of
roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for permitted uses
are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate location
outside of the setback area is available.
         b.   Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be
permitted for the development of storm water drainage swales between the
developed area of the site (including a storm water detention facility on the
site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetland. Detention basins within the
setback are generally discouraged, unless it can be shown that resultant
modifications will not impair water quality, habitat, or flood storage
functions.
         c.   No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to
install piers for the limited development of walkways and observation decks.
Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and
should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois natural
areas inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species.
         d.   Wetland area occupied by the development of decks and walkways
must be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement.
         e.   Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of storm water
management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved and total
wetland acreage is preserved. Where such modification is permitted, wetlands
shall be protected from the effects of increased storm water runoff by measures
such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer strips,
and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. The direct
entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided. Environmental impact
analysis of wetland modification may be required in accordance with section
 6-2D-8-7 of this article.
An applicant for a site development permit (see section
6-2D-8-4 of this article) must stabilize areas left exposed after land surface
modification with vegetation normally associated with that stream or wetland.
The planting of native riparian vegetation is recommended as the preferred
stabilization measure. Other techniques should be used only when and where
vegetation fails to control erosion. The preferred alternative is riprap, using
natural rock materials where practicable, installed on eroding bank areas in a
manner that provides interstitial space for vegetative growth and habitat for
macroinvertebrates and other stream organisms. Lining of the stream channel
bottom is not permitted.
The applicant shall minimize access to the applicant's proposed development
activity within all or part of the lowland conservancy overlay district where
such access could adversely affect the stream, lake, pond, wetland, or related
environmentally sensitive areas.
   E.   Site Development Plan: A site development plan must be prepared for any
proposed development within, or partly within, the lowland conservancy overlay
district and must indicate:
      1.   Dimension and area of parcel, showing also the vicinity of the site
in sufficient detail to enable easy location, in the field, of the site for
which the site development permit is sought, and including the boundary line,
underlying zoning, a legend, a scale, and a north arrow. This requirement may
be satisfied by the submission of a separate vicinity map;
      2.   Location of any existing and proposed structures;
      3.   Location of existing or proposed on site sewage systems or private
water supply systems;
      4.   Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond, and
its ordinary high water mark;
      5.   Location and landward limit of all wetlands;
      6.   Location of setback lines as defined in this section
 6-2D-8;
      7.   Location of the 100-year floodway and floodplain limits;
      8.   Location of existing or future access roads;
      9.   Specifications and dimensions of stream, wetland or other water
areas proposed for alterations;
      10.   Cross sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood
storage volumes; and
      11.   Such other information as reasonably requested by the village of
Manhattan.
The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified professional
engineer, that demonstrates that the proposed development activity will not
endanger health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or diversion
of flood flow. The developer shall also show, by submitting appropriate
calculations and resource inventories, that the proposed development activity
will not substantially reduce natural floodwater storage capacity, destroy
valuable habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna, adversely affect water
quality or ground water resources, increase storm water runoff velocity so that
water levels on other lands are substantially raised or the danger from
flooding increased, or adversely impact any other natural stream, floodplain,
or wetland functions, and is otherwise consistent with the intent of this
section
 6-2D-8.
   F.   Geologic And Soil Report: The site proposed for development shall be
investigated to determine the soil and geologic characteristics, including soil
erosion potential. A report, prepared by a licensed professional engineer,
geoscientist, or soil scientist experienced in the practice of geologic and
soil mechanics, shall be submitted with every application for land development
within the lowland conservancy overlay district. This report shall include a
description of soil type and stability of surface and subsurface conditions.
Any area that the investigation indicates as being subject to geologic or soil
hazards shall not be subjected to development, unless the engineer or soil
scientist can demonstrate conclusively that these hazards can be overcome.
   G.   Hydrologic Controls/Drainage Control Plan: A drainage control plan that
describes the hydraulic characteristics of on site and nearby watercourses as
well as the proposed drainage plan, prepared by a registered professional
engineer experienced in hydrology and hydraulics, shall be submitted with each
application for land development within the lowland conservancy overlay
district. Unless otherwise noted, the following restrictions, requirements and
standards shall apply to all development within the lowland conservancy overlay
district:
      1.   Natural open channel drainageways shall be preserved; and
      2.   Runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g., roofs,
driveways, streets, patios, etc.) shall be collected and transported to a
drainageway (preferably a natural drainageway) with sufficient capacity to
accept the discharge without undue erosion or detrimental impact. Vegetated
drainage swales are preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or other
manufactured materials.
The drainage control plan shall identify appropriate measures, such as recharge
basins and detention/retention basins, which will limit the quantitative and
qualitative effects of storm water runoff to predevelopment conditions.
   H.   Site Grading And Excavation Plan: This subsection applies to the extent
that grading and excavation and erosion control plans, which satisfy the
following requirements, are not already required by a jurisdiction.
      1.   A site grading and excavation plan, prepared by a registered
professional engineer, trained and experienced in civil engineering, shall be
submitted with each application for a site development permit and shall include
the following:
         a.   Details of the existing terrain and drainage pattern with one
foot (1') contours;
         b.   Proposed site contours at one foot (1') intervals;
         c.   Dimensions, elevation and contours of grading, excavation and
fill; slopes of all drainage swales shall be a minimum of two percent (2%)
through the side and rear yard drainage easements;
         d.   A description of methods to be employed in disposing of soil and
other material that is removed from allowable grading and excavation sites,
including location of the disposal site if on the property;
         e.   A schedule showing when each stage of the project will be
completed, including the total area of soil surface to be disturbed during each
stage, and estimated starting and completion dates. The schedule shall be
prepared so as to limit, to the shortest possible period, the time soil is
exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to initiation
of the improvements; and
         f.   A detailed description of the revegetation and stabilization
methods to be employed, to be prepared in conjunction with the landscape plan
per subsection I of this section. This description should include locations of
erosion control measures such as sedimentation basins, straw bales, diversion
swales, etc.
The grading and excavation plan must be consistent with all the provisions of
this section
 6-2D-8.
      2.   Unless otherwise provided in this section
6-2D-8, the following restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to
all development within the district:
         a.   Every effort shall be made to develop the site in such a manner
so as to minimize the alteration of the natural topography;
         b.   No grading, filling, cleaning, clearing, terracing or excavation
of any kind shall be initiated until final engineering plans are approved and
the site development permit is granted by the village of Manhattan; and
         c.   The depositing of any excavation, grading or clearing material
within a stream, lake, pond or wetland area shall be prohibited.
In addition to locating all site improvements on the subject property to
minimize adverse impacts on the stream, lake, pond, or wetland, the applicant
shall install a berm, curb, or other physical barrier during construction, and
following completion of the project, where necessary, to prevent direct runoff
and erosion from any modified land surface into a stream, lake, pond, or
wetland. All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be located as far as
possible from a stream, lake, pond, or wetland.
The village of Manhattan may limit development activity in or near a stream,
lake, pond, or wetland to specific months, and to a maximum number of
continuous days or hours, in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the
village of Manhattan may require that equipment be operated from only one side
of a stream, lake, or pond in order to minimize bank disruption. Other
development techniques, conditions, and restrictions may be required in order
to minimize adverse impacts on streams, lakes, ponds or wetlands, and on any
related areas not subject to development activity.
   I.   Natural Vegetation Buffer Strip Required; Vegetation And Revegetation/
Landscape Plan: To minimize erosion, stabilize the stream bank, protect water
quality, maintain water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and
wildlife habitat, to screen manmade structures, and also to preserve aesthetic
values of the natural watercourse and wetland areas, a natural vegetation strip
shall be maintained along the edge of the stream, lake, pond or wetland. The
natural vegetation strip shall be as described in subsection C of this section
and shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or
intermittent stream, lake or pond and the edge of wetland.
Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may be selectively pruned
or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a filtered view of
the water body from the principal structure and for reasonable private access
to the stream, lake, pond, or wetland. Said pruning and removal activities
shall ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for stream bank
stabilization and erosion control.
A landscape plan, prepared by a professional, shall be submitted with each site
development permit application for development activity within the lowland
conservancy overlay district and contain the following:
      1.   A plan describing the existing vegetative cover of the property and
showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part of the
proposed construction; and
      2.   A plan describing the proposed revegetation of disturbed areas
specifying the materials to be used.
The vegetation must be planned in such a way that access for stream maintenance
purposes shall not be prevented. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2D-8-6: WATERCOURSE RELOCATION AND MINOR MODIFICATIONS (INCLUDING
CHANNELIZATION AND RELOCATION):
   A.   Watercourse relocation or modification is generally not permitted
because these activities are not usually consistent with the purposes of this
section
6-2D-8. Under certain circumstances, relocation and minor modification may be
permitted through a site development permit where certain problems can be
mitigated by relocation and/or minor modification, specifically when:
      1.   Off site hydrologic conditions are causing erosion, flooding and
related problems; or
      2.   On site soil and geologic conditions are resulting in unstable
conditions that pose hazards to life, health, and existing structures or
property; or
      3.   The quality of previously modified or relocated streams can be
improved through restoration; or
      4.   Officially adopted storm water management plans call for placement
of detention or retention facilities in a stream; or
      5.   Public utilities, including sanitary sewers, pipelines, and
roadways, require stream crossing or relocation where there are not practical
alternatives.
Modification of watercourses as a convenience for site design purposes is not
permitted.
   B.   1. Conditions And Restrictions For Permitting Stream Modification:
Stream modification, when permitted, is subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:
         a.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be
significantly improved by the modification; no significant habitat area may be
destroyed;
         b.   The amount of flow and velocity of a stream is not to be
increased or decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject property,
unless this reflects an improvement over previous conditions in terms of
reduced flooding, reduced erosion, or enhanced low flow conditions;
         c.   Prior to diverting water into a new channel, a qualified
professional approved by the village of Manhattan shall inspect the stream
modification, and issue a written report to the village of Manhattan that the
modified stream complies with the requirements in subsection
6-2D-5G2 of this article; and
         d.   Stream channel enlargement, or other modifications that would
increase conveyance, shall not be permitted if the intended purpose is to
accommodate development activities in the floodplain.
      2.   Required Content Of Stream Modification, Relocation Plan: Stream
relocation may be permitted in accordance with a stream relocation plan that
provides for:
         a.   The creation of a natural meander pattern, pools, riffles, and
substrate;
         b.   The formation of gentle side slopes (at least 3 feet horizontally
per 1 foot vertically), including installation of erosion control features;
         c.   The utilization of natural materials wherever possible;
         d.   The planting of vegetation normally associated with streams,
including primarily native riparian vegetation;
         e.   The creation of spawning and nesting areas wherever appropriate;
         f.   The reestablishment of the fish population wherever appropriate;
         g.   The restoration of water flow characteristics compatible with
fish habitat areas, wherever appropriate;
         h.   The filling and revegetation of the prior channel;
         i.   A proposed phasing plan, specifying time of year for all project
phases;
         j.   Plans for sediment and erosion control; and
         k.   Establishment of a low flow channel that reflects the conditions
of a natural stream.
      3.   Criteria For Permitting Armoring Of Channels And Banks: Armoring in
the form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or devices is not permitted
except in accordance with the following:
         a.   Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way and the
use of vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the
shoreline or bank;
         b.   The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland, or
between a wetland and a lake or pond;
         c.   The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the
transmittal of wave energy or currents to other properties; and
         d.   The change in the horizontal or vertical configuration of the
land must be kept to a minimum. Where permission to install bulkheads or other
armoring devices is requested as part of the site development permit
application, documentation and certification pertaining to the items above must
be submitted.

management permit may be recorded. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2F-6: FUNDING OF LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF STORM WATER FACILITIES:
As a condition of approval of any application for a storm water management
permit, unless the maintenance responsibility for the storm water drainage
system to be constructed or installed in connection therewith has been accepted
by a public entity, the administrator will require assurance of long term
funding in a form found acceptable to the permitting authority. A corporation
with a bond rating of "A" or higher from a major investment firm (i.e.,
Standard and Poor, Moody or equivalent) will be considered to have met the long
term maintenance funding requirement. Absent some other form of agreement, then
the administrator shall require the establishment of a special service area
pursuant to 35 Illinois Compiled Statutes 200/27-5 et seq., either as the
primary means of providing for the long term maintenance of the facilities, or
as a backup vehicle in the event the entity designated by the applicant as
having primary maintenance responsibility fails to adequately carry out its
duties.
If the establishment of a special service area is required, the administrator
shall consider and approve a good faith estimate by the applicant of the tax
rate required to produce a tax to be levied upon all taxable property within
the area, sufficient for the long term maintenance of the facilities and submit
the same to the permitting authority which shall incorporate such rate into its
enactment of the ordinances necessary for the establishment of the area.
On or before August 1 of each year thereafter, the administrator shall submit
to the permitting authority a good faith estimate of the amount of tax required
to be levied upon all taxable property within the area for the next fiscal year
for the continued maintenance of the storm water drainage system. (Ord. 947, 3-
20-2007)

6-2I-4: GRANTING OF VARIANCES:
The oversight committee shall not recommend nor shall the village board grant a
variance for a project from the provisions of this chapter unless the variance
is consistent with the purpose provided in section
 6-2A-2 of this chapter and meets the following standards based upon
substantial evidence submitted at the hearing:
   A.   The variance will not increase measurably the probability of flood
damage to insurable structures.
   B.   The variance requested is the minimum required considering each of the
following statements of underlying intent of this chapter and there are no
means other than the requested variance by which the alleged hardships can be

density of the development nor impervious areas on the site.
   D.   The variance is not requested solely as a result of economic hardship.
   E.   If applicable, the variance is required due to unique, natural
topographical features of the site.

oversight committee shall forward the application with its written
recommendations to the village board. The written recommendations of the
oversight committee, when forwarded, shall be accompanied by written findings
of fact with respect to each of the considerations set forth in section
6-2I-4 of this article with citations to the evidence taken at the public
hearing. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2I-6: DECISION:
The village board shall grant the variation, grant the variation with
modifications or conditions, or deny the variation in writing within forty five
(45) days after receipt of the written recommendations of the oversight
committee; but in the event the village board does not act as aforesaid then
the application is denied. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2I-7: CONDITIONS:
A variance less than or different from that requested may be granted when the
record supports the applicant's right to some relief, but not to the relief
requested.
In granting a variance, the village board may impose such specific conditions
and limitations concerning any matter relating to the purposes and objectives
of this chapter on the applicant as may be necessary or appropriate.
Whenever any variance is granted subject to any condition or limitation to be

6-2L-3 of this article shall be in a form satisfactory to the administrator.
Each letter of credit shall be from a lending institution: a) acceptable to the
administrator, as applicable; b) having capital resources of at least ten
million dollars ($10,000,000.00), or such other amount acceptable to the
director or the administrator; c) with an office in Will County, Illinois; and
d) insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Each letter of credit shall, at a minimum, provide that:
   A.   It shall not be canceled without the prior written consent of the
administrator; and shall not expire without written notification of the
administrator at least ninety (90) days prior to expiration; and
   B.   It shall not require the consent of the developer prior to any draw on
it by the director or the administrator; and
   C.   If at any time it will expire within ninety (90) or any lesser number
of days, and if it has not been renewed and the renewal submitted to the
administrator, and if any applicable obligation of the developer for which its
security remains uncompleted or is unsatisfactory, then the director or the
administrator may, without notice and without being required to take any
further action of any nature whatsoever, call and draw down the letter of
credit and thereafter either hold all proceeds as security for the satisfactory
completion of all such obligations or employ the proceeds to complete all such
obligations and reimburse the county or the village for any and all costs and
expenses, including legal fees and administrative costs, incurred by the county
or the village, as the director or the administrator shall determine.
If at any time the administrator determines that the funds remaining in the
letter of credit are not, or may not be, sufficient to pay in full the
remaining unpaid cost of all storm water facility construction or sediment and
erosion control measures, then, within ten (10) days following a demand by the
administrator, the developer shall increase the amount of the letter of credit
to an amount determined by the administrator to be sufficient to pay such
unpaid costs. Failure to so increase the amount of the security shall be
grounds for the director or the administrator to draw down the entire remaining
balance of the letter of credit.
If at any time the administrator determines that the bank issuing the letter of
credit is without capital resources of at least ten million dollars
($10,000,000.00), is unable to meet any federal or state requirement for
reserves, is insolvent, is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is
otherwise in danger of being unable to honor such letter of credit at any time
during its term, or if the administrator otherwise reasonably deems the bank to
be insecure, then the administrator shall have the right to demand that the
developer provide a replacement letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to
the director or the administrator. Such replacement letter of credit shall be
deposited with the director or the administrator not later than ten (10) days
following such demand. Upon such deposit, the director or the administrator
shall surrender the original letter of credit to the developer.
If the developer fails or refuses to meet fully any of its obligations under
this chapter or the applicable certified community ordinance, then the director
or the administrator may, in his or her discretion, draw on and retain all or
any of the funds remaining in the letter of credit. The director or the
administrator thereafter shall have the right to take any action he or she
deems reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or
refusal, and to reimburse the county or the certified community from the
proceeds of the letter of credit for all of its costs and expenses, including
legal fees and administrative expenses, resulting from or incurred as a result
of the developer's failure or refusal to fully meet its obligations under this
chapter or the applicable certified community ordinance. If the funds remaining
in the letter of credit are insufficient to repay fully the county or the
certified community for all such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash
reserve equal to the required letter of credit during the entire time such
letter of credit should have been maintained by the developer, then the
developer shall, upon demand of the director or the administrator therefor,
immediately deposit with the director or the administrator such additional
funds as the director or the administrator determines are necessary to fully
repay such costs and expenses and to establish such cash reserve. (Ord. 947, 3-

ARTICLE M. FEE IN LIEU OF ON SITE DETENTION
SECTION:
6-2M-1: Requirements
6-2M-2: Procedures
6-2M-1: REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   All single-family residential developments under five (5) acres in size
and all other development under one acre in size may pay a fee of one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for each acre-foot of detention which would be
required under this chapter rather than installing detention facilities on the
property, unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the village engineer.
The village of Manhattan also shall have the option for larger properties of
requiring a fee of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for each acre-
foot of detention needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin on site
provided the property will discharge storm water to the village's storm sewer
system and the applicant can demonstrate that the redevelopment will not
increase the risk to downstream properties of flooding. Fee in lieu of on site
detention solely due to financial constraints is not allowed. In addition, a
redevelopment project requesting fee in lieu of detention must demonstrate a
net benefit in water quality will be realized. The one hundred thousand dollar
($100,000.00) fee may be adjusted yearly by the construction cost index (CCI).
   B.   The applicant may provide the village of Manhattan with a detailed,
verifiable cost estimate for actually providing the required storage. If the
village engineer concurs with the cost estimate, the fee set for fee in lieu of
detention will be determined by the lesser of the one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000,00) per acre-foot or part thereof or the verifiable cost of providing
the required storage.
   C.   To encourage redevelopment of properties that have been within the
village limits for a minimum of fifteen (15) years, the village manager may
allow a discount of up to ninety percent (90%) for projects if there is no
increase in impervious area between the existing development and the proposed
redevelopment.
   D.   In instances where regional benefits and economics of scale can be
achieved, it is encouraged for adjacent property owners to utilize a common
regional detention basin. Special fee districts may be established for areas
where a regional storm water management plan has been approved by the village
board. Fee in lieu of detention for the detention volume required for the 2-
year 24-hour storm shall require a variance for sites with aggregate
development or redevelopment greater than twenty (20) acres subsequent to the
effective date of the WCSMO unless tributary to a regional storm water
management system approved by the village board. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)
6-2M-2: PROCEDURES:
The following fee in lieu of detention procedures:
   A.   The administrator may require, or the applicant may submit, a written
request for the payment of a fee in lieu of on site detention to fulfill all or
part of the on site detention requirement in accordance with section
6-2B-1-2 of this chapter. A request for fee in lieu of on site detention shall
be either rejected or approved within forty five (45) days of the written
request unless additional engineering studies are required.
   B.   Approval of a request for fee in lieu of on site detention on a
development site shall be determined by the administrator.
   C.   A fund will be maintained by the village for each of the major
watersheds for the purpose of identifying and controlling all revenues and
expenses related to storm water drainage services resulting from fee in lieu of
on site detention approvals. All monies collected for fee in lieu of on site
detention shall be deposited in these funds and may only be used for purposes
related to storm water management as noted in subsection D of this section.
   D.   Fee in lieu of on site detention revenues from development site may be
used to plan, design or construct an upgrade to existing or future storm water
management systems if the upgrade is consistent with a basin plan, floodplain
study or storm water system improvement that has been approved by the village
board. (Ord. 947, 3-20-2007)

be filled out for your tree. A member of the public works department will come
and evaluate your parkway tree for the condition of the tree. We look to see if
it is still budding, declining, dead or hazardous. We will determine if we need
to place your tree on our removal/replacement list or if it will be added to
our watch list. Because of the high volume of calls we have been receiving for
parkway trees, we ask our residents to be patient with the removal and
replacement process. At this time we are taking service requests for parkway
tree inspections and have no set time schedule for removal and/or replacements.
For those residents that prefer not to wait for a parkway tree, you can bypass
the scheduled process and plant one on your own, at your cost or take advantage
of the village's parkway tree replacement program. If the tree is approved by
the superintendent of public works for the parkway tree replacement program,

8-4C-6-6: INDUSTRIAL USERS:
   A.   Control manholes shall be required on all industrial plant building
sewers, as determined by the village, in a location which will prove to be
accessible for the board to inspect and monitor. Control manholes are to be
constructed at the sole cost of the property owner(s) and/or user, pursuant to
plans and specifications approved by the board, and the property owner(s) and/
or user shall comply within sixty (60) days after receiving notice from the
board requesting installation of the control manholes. The board shall send the
notice to the property owner(s) and/or user by certified mail.
   B.   The village may further require the installation of housed flow
metering and sampling equipment in the building sewers of specific industrial
users. Sample testing procedures shall be the direct responsibility of each
industrial user. It shall be the sole responsibility of the industrial user to
perform all sampling procedures in accordance with the requirements of the
village and to submit the results of the samplings to the village on a periodic
basis, said period to be determined by the village. The samplings shall be
performed and certified by an independent testing laboratory. The property
owner(s) and/or user shall comply within one hundred twenty (120) days after
receiving notice from the Board of said request for installation of flow meters
and sampling equipment. The Board shall send the notice to the property owner
(s) and/or user by certified mail.

maintained by the owner(s) and/or user so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
   E.   In the event that no special manhole is available, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to
the point at which the building sewer is connected. (Ord. 496, 9-20-83)
8-4C-6-7: MEASUREMENTS, TESTS AND ANALYSES:
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this Ordinance shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's
are determined from periodic grab samples.) Sampling and testing shall be the

8-5-1: INSTALLATION; STANDARDS; DAMAGE AND REPLACEMENT:
   A.   Mailboxes and their installation shall conform to the specifications of
the United States postal service. The mailbox shall be mounted six inches (6")
to eight inches (8") back from the curb. If you do not have a raised curb,
contact the local postmaster for guidance. Position your mailbox forty-one to
forty-five inches (41" - 45") high from the road surface to the bottom of the
mailbox or point of mail enetry.
   B.   Address numbers must be inscribed in contrasting color in neat letters
and numerals not less than one inch (1") high on the side of the box visible to
the carrier's regular approach, or in the door if boxes are grouped.
   C.   It is recommended that mailboxes conform to the "U.S. mail" and
"approved by the postmaster general" standards and that they be installed on a
four inch by four inch (4" x 4") wood post or no greater than a two inch (2")
diameter standard strength steel or aluminum pipe. Posts must be installed no
more than twenty-four inches (24") deep in the ground.
   D.   The local postmaster may approve a curbside mailbox constructed by a
customer who, for aesthetic or other reasons, does not want to use an approved
manufactured box. The custom built box must generally meet the same standards
as approved manufactured boxes for flag, size, strength and quality of
construction. If masonry mailbox stands are installed no portion of the masonry
may be closer than eight inches (8") from the back of the curb.
   E.   If any mailbox is damaged or knocked down by the village's snow removal
or other village maintenance activities, the village will attempt to repair the
box and if it is deemed that repair is not an option, the village will replace
the mailbox with a standard mailbox and post as described in subsection C of
this section. If a decorator type mailbox and/or post, as described in
subsection D of this section, is damaged and requires replacement, the village
will reimburse the resident for the cost of materials for the standard type
mailbox and post and it shall be the responsibility of the resident to purchase
and install the decorative mailbox and/or post. The village's liability per
occurrence is limited to the actual cost of a standard mailbox as set out above
or a cash settlement not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00). It is recommended by
the USPS that homeowners should perform an annual mailbox checkup to avoid
damage to your mail or difficulty identifying your address by: (1) tightening
loose hinges on the door; (2) take care of rusty or loose parts; (3) replace
missing or faded house numbers; (4) keep the path to your mailbox clear; and
(5) make sure your post is straight and not leaning or rotted out. (Res. 384-

clerk that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities
for the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the village clerk not less than ten (10) days
prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The
right of way manager shall specify the portion of the right of way upon which

      2.   In the event that the right of way manager fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the village clerk by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter. The ten (10) day and twenty five (25)
day time frames established herein shall commence on the date of service of
notice on the village clerk. Should any applicant intend to commence work on
the basis of this subsection, the applicant shall first notify the village
clerk of such intent and to verify the date of service.
   C.   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Holders Of State
Authorization Under The Cable And Video Competition Law Of 2007: Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state issued authorization under the cable
and video competition law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days
after submission to the village clerk, unless otherwise acted upon by the
village, provided the holder has complied with applicable village codes,
ordinances, and regulations. Any holder intending to commence work on the basis
of this subsection shall first notify the village clerk of such intent and to
verify the actual date of the submission of the application. (Ord. 987, 12-18-
2007)
8-6-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights of way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in or adjacent to the public
rights of way.
   B.   Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   C.   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village
representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall
be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing
special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including,
without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area
and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.
   D.   Business License Required: All contractors and subcontractors
performing construction activities authorized under a permit issued by the
village shall be properly licensed and bonded in accordance with the
requirements of the village. Issuance of a permit by the village does not
excuse all contractors and subcontractors of the applicant from obtaining the
proper license to do business in the village.
   E.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of "as built" drawings or plans to the village clerk
within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section
 8-6-21 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-8: INSURANCE:
   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or
constructing any facility in the right of way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
consultants, agents, representatives, and employees as additional insureds on
the policies listed in subsections A1 and A2 of this section:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal

      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village clerk within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Village Clerk, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested,
of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to
cancel or not to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the village clerk of said notice, and in
no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village clerk evidence of replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections
B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide
to the village clerk evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability
to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private
self-insurer" under the workers' compensation act.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and
appointed officers, officials, consultants, agents, representatives, and
employees harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands,
judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and
costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise
out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions,
failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of
facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering
service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct
or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village
clerk in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the village board, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the village board. Any surety bond or letter of credit
provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the right of way manager, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs, including attorney fees, that the village
estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such
restoration. The reasonably estimated cost as described above shall be
multiplied by one hundred twenty five percent (125%) to establish the security
fund amount. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each
phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase
or phases, the right of way manager may, in the exercise of sound discretion,
allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be
applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any
single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) calendar days' advance
written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for
such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made
if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of
written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the
security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount
specified in subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 987, 12-18-
2007)
8-6-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:
   A.   Village Right To Revoke Permit: The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete

      2.   Noncompliance with this chapter;
      3.   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public rights of way

deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village clerk within five (5) working days after receipt of
the written notice of revocation; or
      3.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the public rights of way and restore the rights
of way to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such

written notice of revocation.
The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this subsection.
   D.   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection A of
this section.
   E.   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection C of this section, the village or
its designee may, at the option of the village: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2)
upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days'
notice to the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them
abandoned and property of the village. The permittee shall be liable in all
events to the village for all costs of removal. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)

to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No Interference With Village Facilities: No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the right of way manager determines that the
proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
      2.   Minimum Interference And Impact: The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right of way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right of
way.
      3.   No Interference With Travel: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right of way.
      4.   No Limitations On Visibility: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right of way.
      5.   Size Of Utility Facilities: The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
      6.   Noise Disturbances: No utility facility shall be placed at any
location in such proximity to any residence, business or institution such that
operation of internal systems, cooling and/or exhaust fans, etc., within the
facility creates noise levels discernible and/or disturbing to the occupants of
any nearby residence, business or institution.
   B.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways:
      1.   Overhead Parallel Facilities: Overhead parallel facilities are
strongly discouraged and shall only be allowed if the village determines that
placement of facilities underground is impractical, unfeasible or undesirable.
Temporary installation of overhead facilities may be allowed if necessary to
provide service prior to the availability of suitable conditions or acquisition
of necessary easement(s). Determination of the acceptability of an overhead
installation and the conditions for such installation shall be at the sole
discretion of the village. If deemed by the village to be acceptable, an
overhead parallel facility may be located within the right of way lines of a
highway only if:
         a.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right of way line
and as nearly parallel to the right of way line as reasonable pole alignment
will permit;
         b.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (2') behind the face of the curb,
where available;
         c.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (4') outside the outer
shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         d.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         e.   Any ground mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (1')
of the right of way line or as near as possible to the right of way line.
      2.   Underground Parallel Facilities: An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right of way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   The facility is located as near the right of way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (8') from and parallel to the right of
way line;
         b.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right of way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') from the right of way line and any above grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') of the right of way line or
as near as practicable.
      3.   Design Parameters Used As Guidelines: The design parameters
specified in this section shall be used as guidelines to be followed in all
cases unless special circumstances, as defined by the village, warrant
consideration of a variance.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.
      4.   Overhead Power Or Communication Facility: Overhead power or
communication facilities are strongly discouraged and shall only be allowed if
the village determines that placement of facilities underground is impractical,
unfeasible or undesirable. Temporary installation of overhead facilities may be
allowed if necessary to provide service prior to the availability of suitable
conditions or acquisition of necessary easement(s). Determination of the
acceptability of an overhead installation and the conditions for such
installation shall be at the sole discretion of the village. In such cases, an
overhead power or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled, "construction of electric power and communication lines" (83
Ill. adm. code 305);
         b.   Poles are located within one foot (1') of the right of way line
of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         c.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      5.   Underground Power Or Communication Facility: An underground power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:

provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right of way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
[1989]).
   D.   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights Of Way: The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights of way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   E.   Freestanding Facilities:
      1.   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right of way.
      2.   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right of way to be screened from view. Cable and video service providers shall
bear the sole responsibility of installation, replacement and maintenance of
all required screening and landscaping so long as the facilities remain in the
right of way.
   F.   Facilities Installed Aboveground: Aboveground facilities are strongly
discouraged and shall only be allowed if the village determines that placement
of facilities underground is impractical, unfeasible or undesirable. Temporary
installation of overhead facilities may be allowed if necessary to provide
service prior to the availability of suitable conditions or acquisition of
necessary easement(s). Determination of the acceptability of an aboveground
installation and the conditions for such installation shall be at the sole
discretion of the village. In such cases, aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
      1.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      2.   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      3.   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   G.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicality;
         d.   The proposed method of attachment;
         e.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         f.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         g.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         h.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   H.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right of way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
      3.   The village may require that facilities of a similar type and
function be installed with uniformity in appearance to facilities at other
locations with respect to size, color, materials, etc. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-16: CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS:

(6") or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, directional
drilling, guided with auger, or auger and following pipe method.
         e.   Tree Preservation: Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designated by the village to be preserved or protected shall be bored
under or around the root system.
      2.   Trenching: Trenching for all areas, and especially for paved or hard
surface areas, shall be performed only in circumstances when directional boring
or other trenchless construction method is impractical or unfeasible, at the
discretion of the director of public works. If deemed necessary, trenching for
facility installation, repair, or maintenance on rights of way shall be done in
accord with the applicable portions of section 603 of IDOT's "Standard
Specifications For Road And Bridge Construction".
         a.   Length: The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipeline testing. Only
one-half (1/2) of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless
special permission is obtained from the right of way manager.
         b.   Open Trench And Excavated Material: Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by chapter 6 of the "Illinois
Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices". Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right of way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off road location.
         c.   Drip Lines Of Trees: The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      3.   Backfilling:
         a.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's "Standard Specifications For
Road And Bridge Construction". When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         b.   For a period of three (3) years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the right of way manager, the utility, at its expense, shall within
ten (10) calendar days of such order remove any pavement and backfill material
to the top of the installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill
material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the
proper grades, as determined by the right of way manager.
      4.   Pavement Cuts: Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this subsection A4 is
permitted under section
8-6-21 of this chapter, the following requirements shall apply:
         a.   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-7 gradation, as designated
by the right of way manager.
         b.   Restoration of pavement, in kind, including pedestrian travelways
such as sidewalks and bike paths, shall be accomplished as soon as practicable,
and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided immediately.
Temporary pavement shall be of sufficient quality and sufficiently smooth to
allow for the safe use of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists as may be
applicable until final restoration can be completed. Any subsequent failure of
either the temporary repair or the restoration shall be rebuilt upon
notification by the village.
         c.   All pavement removals shall be accomplished by straight, full
depth saw cuts, a minimum of four feet (4') from each edge of the trench or
excavation. Saw cut joints created by the trench or excavation and subsequent
pavement replacement shall be crack filled immediately upon completion of final
pavement restoration.
         d.   For all rights of way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or resurfaced in the last
three (3) years, pavement cut permits shall not be issued unless such work is
determined to be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and
unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is
necessary for a JULIE locate.
      5.   Encasement:
         a.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village engineer.
         b.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (1') of the right of way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be located
in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of the
highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right of way.
      6.   Minimum Cover Of Underground Facilities: Cover shall be provided and
maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for minimum
cover for the type of facility:

agreement with the village as permitted by law, in order to proactively
minimize storm damage to their facilities.
   B.   Other Utilities; Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right of way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, or as required under this chapter, shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be supervised and
accomplished by competent workers who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   D.   Chemical Use:
      1.   Except as provided in the following subsection, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the village for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      2.   Spraying of any type of brush killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights of way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the right of way manager that such spraying is the only practicable method
of vegetation control. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-18: REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES:
   A.   Notice: Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the
village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights of way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or
upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights of
way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   C.   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights of
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights of way of the village, the utility shall notify the village clerk
within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the village may
direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the right of
way manager determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not
direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice
of abandonment to the village clerk, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by
another utility or person. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
   A.   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten (10) calendar days after any portion of
the rights of way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This
includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway
surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the right of way
manager. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling,
regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right
of way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to
the commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may
be extended by the right of way manager for good cause shown.
   B.   The scope and extent to which all restoration shall be performed shall
be at the sole discretion of the right of way manager. Sidewalk removed for
replacement shall be removed to the nearest full section or expansion joint.
Any sidewalks, bike paths, roadways, driveways, landscaped area or other areas
under which directional boring has been performed and for which disturbance of
any kind is visible at the surface shall be repaired as deemed necessary by the
right of way manager; any areas between disturbances less than one hundred feet
(100') in length shall not be allowed to remain in place but shall be repaired
in conjunction with the disturbed sections. Any trees or plantings disturbed by
utility installation shall be acceptably pruned in accordance with section
8-6-17 of this chapter if deemed salvageable by the right of way manager. Any
disturbed trees or plantings deemed unsalvageable shall be replaced in kind and
as directed by the director of public works. Backfilling of excavations and
trenches with granular limestone materials shall not be allowed adjacent to the
roots of trees and shrubs. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-20: MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:
   A.   General: Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights of way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
right of way manager or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the village
clerk a description of the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty
eight (48) hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-21: VARIANCES:
   A.   Request For Variance: A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the right of way
manager as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each
provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons
why a variance should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The right of way manager shall decide
whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified
in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The right of way manager may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the right of way manager may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Denial Of A Variance: A permit shall be deemed rejected and, if
applicable, the forty five (45) day time period as set forth in section
8-6-5 of this chapter shall be immediately tolled, upon the right of way
manager's denial of a request for a variance.
   F.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the right of
way manager under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal
to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may designate.
The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the village clerk
within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The village board shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7)
days after the filing of the appeal. The village board shall timely decide the
appeal. (Ord. 987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code; and a separate violation shall be deemed committed for each
violation, and on each day during and on which a violation occurs or continues.
There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including
third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties
under its permit and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the
utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review
or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may
be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord.
987, 12-18-2007)
8-6-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

and convincing evidence. The owner shall be sent immediate notification of the
determination by registered or certified mail that includes a completed
description of the appeal process.
   B.   A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the animal control
administrator, his or her designee, or the director determines the conduct of
the dog was justified because:

      2.   The threatened person was tormenting, abusing, assaulting or
physically threatening the dog or its offspring;

   C.   Testimony of a certified applied behaviorist, a board certified
veterinary behaviorist or another recognized expert may be relevant to the
determination of whether the dog's behavior was justified pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
   D.   If deemed dangerous, the animal control administrator or his or her
designee, or the director shall order the dog to be spayed or neutered within
fourteen (14) days at the owner's expense and microchipped, if not already, and
one or more of the following as deemed appropriate under the circumstances and
necessary for the protection of the public:
      1.   Evaluation of the dog by a certified applied behaviorist, a board
certified veterinary behaviorist or another recognized expert in the field and
completion of training or other treatment as deemed appropriate by the expert.

whenever the animal is on public premises.

physically handicapped and sentry, guard or police owned dogs are exempt from
this section; provided, an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is
performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in accordance with

9-2-27: VICIOUS DOG (ANIMAL):
   A.   In order to have an animal deemed "vicious", an animal control officer,
chief of police or the village attorney must give notice of the infraction that
is the basis of the investigation to the owner. The police department shall
conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the owner,
gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or behavioral
evidence and make a detailed report recommending a finding that the animal is a
vicious animal and give the report to the state's attorney's office and the
owner. The state's attorney, village attorney or animal control officer may
file a complaint in the circuit court to deem a dog to be a vicious dog.
Testimony of a certified applied behaviorist, board certified veterinary
behaviorist or another recognized expert may be relevant to the court's
determination of whether the dog's behavior was justified. The petitioner must
prove the dog is a vicious dog by clear and convincing evidence. Will County
animal control shall determine where the animal shall be confined during the
pendency of the case. The provisions and appeal rights of this section shall be
carried out pursuant to section 15 of the animal control act 1 .
   B.   If the dog is found to be a vicious dog, the dog shall be spayed or
neutered within ten (10) days of the finding at the expense of its owner,
microchipped and subject to enclosure. A dog found to be a vicious dog shall
not be released to the owner until the animal control warden or chief of police
approves the enclosure. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give
away the dog without court approval. Whenever an owner of a vicious dog
relocates, he or she shall notify both the animal control administrator of
county animal control where he or she has relocated and the animal control
administrator of county animal control where he or she formerly resided.
   C.   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which
has been found to be a vicious dog unless the dog is kept in an enclosure. The
only times that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure are:
      1.   If it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care
for the dog.
      2.   In the case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog's life
is threatened, or
      3.   To comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction,
provided that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a leash not
exceeding six feet (6') in length and shall be under the direct control and
supervision of the owner or keeper of the dog or muzzled in its residence.
   D.   Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not
confined to an enclosure shall be impounded by the animal control
administrator, an animal control warden or the law enforcement authority having
jurisdiction in such area.
   E.   If the owner of the dog has not appealed the impoundment order to the
circuit court in the county in which the animal was impounded within fifteen
(15) working days, the dog may be euthanized.
   F.   Upon filing notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be
automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear
the burden of timely notification to animal control in writing.
   G.   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped and sentry, guard or police owned dogs are exempt from
this section; provided, an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is
performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in accordance with
section
9-2-6 of this chapter. It shall be the duty of the owner of such exempted dog
to notify the animal control administrator of changes of address. In the case
of a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the animal control administrator
advised of the location where such dog will be stationed. The animal control

(9:00) A.M. through five o'clock (5:00) P.M. using the tow hearing request
form. If the request for a preliminary hearing is timely filed, the chief of
police or his designee shall conduct such preliminary hearing within twenty
four (24) hours after the request, or by a date mutually agreeable to the
parties, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, nine o'clock (9:00) A.M.
through five o'clock (5:00) P.M. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary hearing. The formal rules
of evidence will not apply and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after
the preliminary hearing, the chief of police or his designee determines there
is probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall
order the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle, as provided in this
chapter, unless the owner of the motor vehicle posts with the village a cash
bond as set forth in section
10-6-3 of this chapter. However, if the chief of police or his designee finds
that no such violation occurred, the chief of police or his designee shall
order the return of the motor vehicle or cash bond, but the owner shall be
responsible for any towing and storage charges. (Ord. 1007, 11-4-2008)

requests an administrative hearing in writing. Said request shall be made in
person and in writing at the Manhattan village hall, Monday through Friday,
excluding holidays, nine o'clock (9:00) A.M. through four thirty o'clock (4:30)
P.M. using the administrative hearing request form. The hearing shall be
conducted and held, unless the motor vehicle was subject to successful
forfeiture proceedings pursuant to applicable state or federal forfeiture laws,
no later than forty six (46) days after the motor vehicle was seized, unless
continued by the owner or by order of the hearing officer; or unless the motor
vehicle was subject to unsuccessful forfeiture proceedings, in which case the
hearing shall be conducted and held, unless continued by the owner or by order
of the hearing officer, no later than forty six (46) days after the conclusion
of the forfeiture proceedings. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the
hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct
witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of
evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the motor vehicle, operated with the permission,
express or implied, of the owner, was used in the commission of any of the
violations set forth in this chapter, and that none of the exceptions apply,
the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the
motor vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative fee in the
amount as set forth in section
10-6-3 of this chapter, which shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
village. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing
officer shall enter a default order finding the owner of record of the motor
vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount
as set forth in section
10-6-3 of this chapter, which shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
village, and a copy of which default order shall be sent to the registered
owner via certified mail, return receipt requested. If a cash bond has been
posted, the bond shall be applied. If a motor vehicle has been impounded when
such administrative fee is imposed, the village may seek to obtain a judgment
on the debt and enforce such judgment against the motor vehicle as provided by
law. However, if the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the
hearing officer shall order the return of the motor vehicle or cash bond, but
the owner shall be responsible for any towing and storage charges. (Ord. 1007,
11-4-2008)
10-6-7: FAILURE TO PAY:
If the administrative fee and towing and storage charges are not paid:
   A.   After the time to request an administrative hearing has expired for an
owner of record who did not request an administrative hearing, or
   B.   Within thirty (30) days after entry of an administrative fee against an
owner of record who requested a hearing and the owner did not file a petition
for judicial review, or
   C.   Within thirty (30) days after an action seeking judicial review has
been resolved in favor of the village,
the village shall be authorized to dispose of said vehicle (including contents
and license plates) in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed motor vehicles. (Ord. 1007, 11-4-2008)
10-6-8: RIGHT TO APPEAL:
Upon a finding after an administrative hearing that the motor vehicle was used
in the commission of any of the violations set forth in this chapter and that
the owner of record of the motor vehicle is civilly liable to the village for
an administrative fee, the owner has a right to petition for judicial review
within thirty (30) days of the finding. If a petition for judicial review is
filed, a copy must be provided to the village no later than seventy two (72)
hours after filing said petition. (Ord. 1007, 11-4-2008)
