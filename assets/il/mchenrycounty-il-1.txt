2.44.010   Records management policy
§ 2.44.010 RECORDS MANAGEMENT POLICY.
   A.   Policy Statement and Purpose of Manual.
      1.   General Policy.
         a.   McHenry County’s Records Management policy requires that its
public records be created, maintained, and disposed in full accordance with
federal, state, and county laws, regulations, and administrative rules. It is
also the County’s policy to facilitate, to the extent allowable by law, the
public’s access to information in public records. In the interest of
efficiently using public resources, County records shall be retained only as
long as is required to meet legal, financial, administrative, or historical
needs.
         b.   County employees are responsible for ensuring that records are as
complete and accurate as is necessary for a third party to reconstruct from
those records the official functions and activities of County government.
         c.   The purpose of this Manual is to provide consistent policies,
procedures, and standards for the effective management of the County’s records.
A detailed program for the management of all County records, including
electronic records, is necessary to ensure compliance with state and federal
laws, and to ensure that County records meet judicial admissibility standards
when required in litigation. Effective records management includes all stages
in the “life” of a record: creation, use, maintenance, and disposition by
destruction or transfer to an appropriate storage location.
      2.   Records Management Program Objectives. McHenry County records
management objectives include:
         a.   The improved accessibility of information regardless of the media
containing that information.
         b.   The protection of vital public records.
         c.   The formalized identification and tracking of county records.
         d.   The establishment of consistent records retention practices.
   B.   Definitions. When used in this document, the terms listed below have
the meanings indicated.

   C.   Organization and Administration. This section outlines the
responsibilities of County departments regarding the Records Management
Program.
      1.   Records Management Responsibilities. The Records Manager is part of
the Building Operations Department and is responsible for;
         a.   Working with the County Administrator, Department heads, Elected
Officials, and their designees to identify and categorize county records,
regardless of their format.
         b.   Developing and implementing a plan and program for effective
management of the County’s records.
         c.   Developing and implementing a plan and program for the permanent
preservation of the County’s archival records.
         d.   Coordinating between all County management staff, including
elected and appointed officials and the State Local Record Commission, to
facilitate compliance with records retention policies.
      2.   Information Technology Department Responsibilities. The I.T.
department is responsible for:
         a.   Developing and implementing a technology and software plan for
records and workflow management.
         b.   Developing and administering technical procedures for the storage
of electronic records.
         c.   Ensuring that electronic records are usable until their retention
and preservation requirements are met, throughout software and hardware
changes.
         d.   Assisting the Records Manager and County departments with the
maintenance and authorized destruction of electronic records.
      3.   County Departmental Responsibilities. Government employees are
responsible for:
         a.   Understanding and following information and records management
policies that apply to their job
         b.   Managing the public records they produce according to County and
departmental procedures
         c.   Directing any questions regarding records policy to their
departmental Records Contact, their Department Head, or the Records Manager.
   D.   Scope of Manual. The policies and procedures outlined in this manual
are intended to cover the creation, use, maintenance and disposition of public
records as defined in the Illinois Local Records Act, 50 ILCS 205/3. (see
online at http://www.legis.state.il.us/legislation/ilcs/ch50/ch5 0act205.htm.)
Some provisions of this manual regarding management of electronic documents are
contingent upon establishment of an Electronic Document Management System
(EDMS).
   E.   Designation of Records Representatives by County Departments.
      1.   It is important for County Departments to actively manage their
records and coordinate that activity with the Records Manager and the
Information Technology Department. Therefore, each County Department should
designate at least one individual as Records Contact for the Department. The
Records Contact will act as the department’s primary representative regarding
records management policy and issues.
      2.   Each County Agency may also designate additional individuals to
serve as backup or secondary Records Management contacts where separate
administrative units exist within a department.
   F.   Records Inventory and Retention Schedules.
      1.   Schedule Development and Revision.
         a.   Retention Schedules for each County department are established as
follows:
            (1)   With the help of the Records Contact(s), the Records Manager
reviews the record types produced.
            (2)   These records are categorized into specific record series
designations including a series name and unique identifying number. Other
record series characteristics such as storage medium (paper, digital, microfilm
etc.), active record period, special security requirements, and vital record
designations are also established at this time.
            (3)   The total retention period for each record series is set by
recommendations from a field representative from the Illinois State Archives,
Records Management Section. The field representative documents the department’s
record series and retention recommendations on the form, Application for
Authority to Dispose of Local Records.
            (4)   The Department Head signs/approves the application form.
         b.   The Records Manager will help coordinate the Archives Field
Representative’s review of departmental records and will assist in submitting
the application for Local Record Commission approval.
         c.   Note: The retention periods for records produced in the Circuit
Clerk’s office are set by guidelines published by the Administrative Office of
Illinois Courts’ Manual on Recordkeeping.
         d.   The Records Manager summarizes the information gathered above in
a Master Retention Schedule which will serve as a general reference for
retention information. A County department creating a new record series or
wishing to modify the retention period of an existing record series should
contact the Records Manager for advice and assistance in revising its schedule.
      2.   Retention of Electronic Records. Electronic records must be
inventoried and scheduled like any other form of public record; however,
retention policies can only be enforced when those records that have been
properly saved and indexed in an Electronic Document Management System
(database). A key portion of the statutory definition of a “public record” is
that it is “preserved.....as evidence of the organization, function, polices,
decisions, procedures [of the agency] (50 ILCS 205/3).” When electronic
document management software is implemented, the proper method of “preserving
as evidence” will be through an EDMS database. The “official copy” or “record
copy” of a scheduled electronic record will be indexed and saved in an EDMS
database.
      3.   Schedule Implementation. The Records Manager will assist departments
in retention schedule implementation, and will coordinate requests to dispose
of records in a timely manner as outlined in Section H. Any questions about the
applicability of schedules should be referred to the Records Manager.
   G.   Records Disposition - Procedures for Authorizing Records Destruction.
      1.   Note: The Local Records Act states that, “All public records made or
received by, or under the authority of, or coming into the custody, control, or
possession of any officer or agency shall not be mutilated, destroyed,
transferred, removed or otherwise damaged or disposed of, in whole or in part
except as provided by law.” (50 ILCS 205/4)
      2.   Also, the unauthorized destruction of any public record is
considered tampering under the Illinois Criminal Code: “Tampering with public
records. A person who knowingly and without lawful authority alters, destroys,
defaces, removes or conceals any public record commits a Class 4 felony.” (720
ILCS 5/32-8)
      3.   The legal disposition of public records requires approval and
authorization by State agencies. The procedure for the Clerk of the Circuit
Court varies slightly from other departments and is outlined in the chart
below. The general requirements are:
         a.   Application for Authority to Dispose - As noted in Section F.,
the Application for Authority to Dispose is the controlling document for
establishing retention schedules for departmental records. For the Clerk of the
Circuit Court, the Manual on Recordkeeping, published by the Administrative
Office of Illinois Courts, sets the applicable retention periods.
         b.   Specific Authorization - Once a given records series reaches its
retention period, the Department Head obtains final authorization for
destruction from the Local Records Commission by filling out a Records Disposal
Certificate (see
Appendix D). This form designates the specific records to be destroyed and
cites the record series and Application Number from the Application for
Authority to Dispose (above).
      4.   Note: Department Directors shall not request authorization to
destroy records pertaining to any pending or threatened legal case, claim,
action, or audit.
      5.   Table 1 below summarizes the disposition process for all County
departments:

Follow-up     signed documentation or certification of destruction (e.g. from shredding      or
Documentation company)                                                                       certification
                                                                                             of
                                                                                             destruction
                                                                                             (e.g. from
                                                                                             shredding
                                                                                             company)
 
      6.   Destruction of Electronic Records.
         a.   Electronic records that meet the criteria of public records may
be destroyed only after obtaining an approved Records Disposal Certificate as
described above.
         b.   Deletion of index pointers to the location of electronic records
on storage media, without erasure of the media sectors containing the record,
is sufficient to constitute destruction of electronic records, especially on
non-erasable media (e.g. CDs and DVDs). Note: this type of deletion renders the
record inaccessible, but not impossible to reconstruct. For records designated
as confidential, physical destruction of the medium or total erasure/rewriting
may be considered. Physical destruction of electronic records must be scheduled
through the IT Department.
      7.   Destruction of Paper Records- Shredding. Public records authorized
for destruction should be disposed of in a timely fashion. To facilitate this
process, and to enable the secure destruction of confidential information, the
preferred destruction method for these public records is offsite shredding by a
licensed, bonded shredding company. The Records Manager will coordinate the
destruction pickup and will maintain the certificate of destruction provided by
the shredding company upon completion of the destruction request. Departments
requiring witnessed destruction of records will be responsible for providing
the personnel to witness the shredding. If a department requires onsite
shredding by a vendor, the department will be responsible for the higher fees
associated with onsite shredding.
   H.   Record System Maintenance/Development.
      1.   Coordination of Departmental Record Systems. The majority of County
departments have developed systems for tracking records they produce. They
range from simple charts and spreadsheets listing file/box
contents, dates, case numbers, etc. to fully developed databases and imaging
systems. These systems will be reviewed as part of the records inventory and
retention policy process outlined above, to ensure that they can meet all
retention and disposition requirements. Also, the Records Manager and the IT
Department are available to advise departments regarding best use of available
records management, document management, and imaging software.
      2.   Manual (Paper) Filing Systems. Recommended practices for maintaining
manual (paper) filing systems include:
         a.   File Labeling - All file folders should have printed labels that
include the file heading and a date reference (usually a year or date range).
This helps identify folders for transfer to storage or for destruction.
         b.   File Headings - Departments should create a reference list of
file headings for any records series that contains alphabetically arranged
subject folders. Use of standard headings simplifies filing and retrieval by
preventing multiple headings for the same subject.
         c.   Annual File Breaks - For subject-filed records series,
departments should start new folders for all headings every one or two years.
This facilitates annual removal of older folders to storage and simplifies
destruction of records whose retention period has expired.
         d.   Permanent Records - Special care should be taken to properly
maintain records with a “permanent” retention period. Departments should avoid
using rubber bands, self-sticking notes, tape, and newsprint in permanent
files. Rubber bands become stiff and stick to paper within a few years. The
adhesive on self-sticking notes dries out and the notes fall off. Adhesive or
pressure-sensitive tapes eventually yellow, and the adhesive becomes gummy with
age causing pages to stick together. Newsprint, because of its acidity, should
be copied on to bond paper for filing.
   I.   Electronic Record Systems. The following guidelines set basic
requirements for the maintenance, use, retention and storage of electronic
records by county agencies. Each department may also consider documenting
standard operating procedures for records creation, indexing, preservation,
etc. in order to control business processes and help maintain accurate,
accessible, and reliable records.
      1.   Creation and Use of Data Files. The maintenance of systems that
produce and store data files for County departments requires the preservation
of as much technical documentation for these systems as possible. Such
documentation may include:
         a.   Hardware and software manuals
         b.   Listings of software names, versions, dates of installation,
upgrades etc.
         c.   Narrative description of systems and their purpose
         d.   Any other technical information provided to read, maintain, or
process the records, including file layouts or data dictionaries.
      2.   Creation and Use of Text Documents. The creation and use of text
documents can be better managed via an Electronic Document Management System.
As noted in Section F. (Retention Schedules), a Records Management goal is to
establish an EDMS to index and track the official file copy of electronic
documents. At a minimum, an EDMS:
         a.   Provides a method for all authorized users of the system to
retrieve desired documents, such as an indexing or text search system.
         b.   Provides security to ensure integrity of the documents.
         c.   Provides a standard interchange format when determined to be
necessary by the user department to permit the exchange of documents on
electronic media among County Agencies using different software or operating
systems.
         d.   Allows for the disposition of documents in accordance with
approved Records Retention Schedules.
      3.   Creation and Use of Digital Images. The following standards must be
met for electronic records stored as digital images on optical or magnetic
media:
         a.   Images produced on any County imaging system must be readable by
in-house users of the images.
         b.   Image files must be accessible for the full retention period
regardless of software changes.
         c.   A visual quality control evaluation must be performed for each
scanned image and related index data. If records are converted to digital
images directly from microfilm, the visual quality control evaluation of images
can be based on a sample of images. The sample size will be determined at the
time of each conversion project.
         d.   As with data systems, technical documentation of imaging systems
shall be maintained. Standard operating procedures for digital imaging,
retrieval, and storage should be documented at the department level.
      4.   Creation and Storage of Backups. In order to ensure that electronic
records are restorable after a disaster or accidental loss, all electronic
records system data and software must be backed up to off-line storage media
and stored securely. Backup procedures will be administered, documented and
maintained by the IT Department.
      5.   Migration Strategy. The migration strategy for upgrading equipment
and storage media as technology evolves shall be documented and include:
         a.   Transferring data from an obsolete technology to a supportable
technology.
         b.   Providing background system compatibility to the data in the old
system, and/or converting data to storage media that the system upgrade and/or
replacement can support.
      6.   Labeling/Indexing Off-Line Media. Items from any record series that
are stored exclusively on off-line storage media must be indexed in the Records
Management database, especially media containing records with long-term or
permanent retention. The media itself will be bar-coded for identification,
with corresponding index information in the Records database as follows:
         a.   Name or other identifier of the County Agency or administrative
unit responsible for the records.
         b.   Descriptive title of the contents.
         c.   Record Series ID.
         d.   Dates of creation.
         e.   Warning if records are confidential.
         f.   Identification of the software (to include specific application
if appropriate) and hardware used.
      7.   Additionally, the following information (if relevant) should be
included for off-line storage of permanent electronic records:
         a.   File title(s).
         b.   Dates of coverage.
         c.   The recording density.
         d.   Type of internal labels.
         e.   Volume serial number, if applicable.
         f.   The number of tracks.
         g.   Character code/software dependency.
         h.   Information about block size.
         i.   Sequence number, if the file is part of a multi-media set.
         j.   Relative starting position of data, if applicable.
      8.   Floppy Disk Storage. Floppy disks (3.5 inch diskettes) may not be
used for the exclusive storage of long-term, permanent, or archival records.
   J.   Storage and Retrieval of Inactive Records.
      1.   Transferring inactive or Semi-Active Records to Storage. Inactive or
semi-active records may be placed into offsite storage if they meet the
following criteria:
         a.   They are public records as defined by the Illinois Local Records
Act (50 ILCS 205/3 -see definitions, above).
         b.   They are prepared according the standards and procedures listed
in
Appendix A.
      2.   Note: The County Archives is designated for storage of public
records listed on official retention schedules only. Non-records, including
supplies, convenience copies, extra copies of printed material, pamphlets, etc.
will not be accepted for storage.
      3.   Retrieval of Stored Records.
         a.   Requests for retrieval of records from storage must be made on a
Records Retrieval Request Form (
Appendix C). Requests for one or two files/boxes may also be made by calling
the Records Technician. Deliveries will be made on the date needed (as
indicated on the request form), according to the following general guidelines:
 
Time Ordered     Delivery Window
By 10:30 a.m.    11 am -12:00 pm
After 10:30 a.m. 3 pm - 4 pm (or next day a.m. as needed)
 
         b.   If records are to be reviewed at the County Archives, an
appointment should be made in advance. No record may be removed from storage
without proper documentation (Check-out) in the Records Management System.
Appendix A
   A.   Guidelines for Boxing Paper Records Paper records should be prepared
for storage as follows:
      1.   Consolidate and securely fasten or staple loose documents if they
are not contained in file folders. Avoid using rubber bands for permanent or
long-term records.
      2.   As much as possible, remove excess copies and non-record material
from files- these may be disposed as a matter of course.
      3.   Pack in standard record center boxes (15 in. x 12 in. x 10 in.) with
lids (contact Building Operations for empty boxes). If you need, or are
sending, other types of boxes (e.g. blueprint or check boxes), please contact
the Records Manager.
      4.   Avoid over packing boxes - allow enough room to comfortably fit your
hand behind the last file in the box. Also, the lid should fit securely on the
box.
      5.   All files in a given box should have the same retention period and,
if possible, should be from the same record series. For example, do not pack
permanent records with those that may be destroyed.
      6.   Do not affix any permanent labels to the boxes at this stage.
Standardized box labels will be provided to the departments as part of the
transfer procedure outlined below.
   B.   Transfer Procedures. Once boxes have been packed, proceed as follows:
      1.   Prepare Records Transmittal Form [see
Appendix B] for all boxes being sent. Note: the accuracy and completeness of
the form data is the responsibility of the department.
      2.   E-mail the Records Transmittal Form to the Records Manager. After
review of the Transmittal Form, standardized box labels will be delivered to
the department.
      3.   Affix the labels to end of each box, centered below the box handle.
Contact the Records Manager if replacement labels are needed.
The box pick-up will be scheduled upon delivery of the labels. Note: improperly
labeled or prepared boxes will not be transferred to storage.

demonstrates that a mistake was made.
   All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of Bids, or to cancel

determination made by the Director of Purchasing.
   O.   Award. The Contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by
appropriate written notice to the lowest Responsible Bidder whose Bid meets the
requirements and criteria set forth in the Invitation for Bids. In the event
the lowest responsible Bid for a Construction project exceeds available funds,
and such Bid does not exceed such funds by more than ten percent (10%), the
Director of Purchasing is authorized, when time or economic considerations
preclude re-solicitation of work on a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment
in the Bid price with the lowest Responsible Bidder, in order to bring the Bid
within the amount of available funds. Contracts shall be awarded according to
the following considerations:
      1.   Lowest and Best Bid. The awards will be made to the lowest
Responsible Bidder, availability of funds and all other relevant factors,
provided the Bid meets the Specifications and other requirements of the Bid
information.

stated separately, will be taken into account, unless stated otherwise in the

price, the unit price will govern unless otherwise stated in the Bid
information.
      6.   Awards of Any or All Items. An award may be made to the lowest
aggregate bidder for all items on an individual item basis unless otherwise
stated in the Bid information. If a split award is not acceptable to the

manufacturers’ guarantees and warranties will be considered in the evaluation

ability to meet specified repair and service requirements may be used in
evaluating Bids.
      10.   Tie Bids. If two or more Bids meeting the Specifications and other
requirements of the Bid information are tied for low price, the Bids will be
treated as follows:
         a.   if there is a significant difference in the responsibility of the
bidders (including ability to deliver in the quantity and at the time
required), the award will be made to the bidder who is deemed to be the most
responsible.
         b.   if there is no significant difference in the responsibility of
the bidders, but there is a difference in the quality of the commodities of
Services offered, the Bid offering the best quality of items or Services will
be accepted.
         c.   if there is no significant difference in responsibility of the
bidders and no difference in the quality of the items and service offered, the
Bid offering the earliest delivery time will be accepted in any case in which
the Bid information specified that the needs of the County require as early
delivery as possible. In all other cases, delivery time will not be considered
in making awards so long as the bidder states delivery will occur not later
than the time specified in the Bid information as the latest acceptable
delivery time.

the award may be split or made by lot.

Contracts, amendments, and extensions, may be signed only by the designated
authority set forth in this Ordinance, are subject to appropriate legal review,
and must be stored and retained according to federal, state and County document
retention policies unless specifically excluded by this or another policy
adopted by the County Board.
(Ord. 7741, passed 7-16-2019)
§ 2.48.290 DEFINITIONS.
   A.   Contract Compliance. The process of reviewing and managing Contracts
and agreements that bind the County. Policies that determine how Contracts will
be processed fall under the responsibility of the County Board and shall be
enforced by County Administration and administered through the Purchasing
Department.
   B.   Contract Administration. The ongoing process of ensuring that the terms
and conditions of Contracts are being implemented as agreed to by the parties.
Contract Administration is the responsibility of the Purchasing Department and
the requesting Department Head or Elected Official. The Department Head or
Elected Official is the individual responsible for promoting the Contract,
including ensuring that appropriate approval is obtained and, where required,
obtaining Liaison Committee and/or Board approval and signature.
(Ord. 7741, passed 7-16-2019)
§ 2.48.300 PROCEDURES.
   A.   All proposed Contracts must be submitted to the Purchasing Department
for review and processing. The Director of Purchasing, upon completion of his
review, may, if deemed necessary, submit the Contract to the State’s Attorney’s
Office to ensure that the Contract meets all legal requirements.
   B.   If submitted to the State’s Attorney’s Office for review, after an
opinion has been rendered on the proposed Contract, the Director of Purchasing
will edit the language of the Contract as suggested by the State’s Attorney’s
Office and forward the revised draft Contract to the Department Head or Elected
Official to obtain approval as required by this Ordinance. If no legal opinion
is requested, the Director of Purchasing will, upon completion of his review,
forward the draft Contract to the Department Head or Elected Official to obtain
approval including, where required, Liaison Committee and/or Board approval and
signature.

the Director of Purchasing shall be responsible to have the Contract executed
on behalf of the County and will advise the requesting Department Head or
Elected Official when the Contract has been duly executed and is in force.
   D.   The Purchasing Department will index and image the Contract, ensuring
access to it by the requester and other County Officials as directed by
statute. The original Contract will be filed with the County Clerk’s office as
mandated by statute. A system will be put in place that will generate a notice
to the originating Department Head or Elected Official six (6) months prior to
the expiration of each Contract to allow the original requester to begin the
process of developing a new Contract.
(Ord. 7741, passed 7-16-2019)
§ 2.48.310 TYPES OF CONTRACTS.
   A.   General Authority. Subject to the limitations of this Section, any type
of Contract which is appropriate to the Procurement and which will promote the
best interests of the County may be used, provided that the use of a cost-plus-
a-percentage- of-cost Contract is prohibited. A cost reimbursement Contract may
be used only when a determination is made in writing that such Contract is
likely to be less costly to the County than any other type or that it is
impracticable to obtain the Goods and Supplies, Equipment, Services, or
Construction required except under such a Contract.
   B.   Multiple Source Contracting.
      1.   General. A multiple source award is an award of an indefinite
quantity for one or more similar Goods and Supplies or Services to more than
one bidder.
      2.   Limitations on Use. A multiple source award may be made when awards
to two or more bidders for similar products is necessary for adequate economic
delivery, service or product compatibility. Any multiple source award shall be
made in accordance with the provision of §§
2.48.110;
2.48.170;
2.48.200; and
2.48.210, as applicable. Multiple source awards shall not be made when a single
award will meet the County’s needs without sacrifice of economy or service.
Awards shall not be made for the purpose of dividing the business, making
available product or supplier selection to allow for user preference unrelated
to utility or economy, or avoiding the resolution of tie Bids. Any such awards
shall be limited to the least number of suppliers necessary to meet the valid
requirements of the County without sacrificing economy and service.
      3.   Contract and Solicitation Provisions. All eligible users of the
Contract shall be named with provisions for additional users to be added if it
will not materially affect the Contract in the solicitation, and it shall be
mandatory that the actual requirements of such users that can be met under the
Contract be obtained in accordance with the Contract, provided that:
         a.   the County shall reserve the right to take Bids separately if a
particular quantity requirement arises which exceeds its normal requirement or
an amount specified in the Contract; and
         b.   the County shall reserve the right to take Bids separately if the
Director of Purchasing approves a finding that the Goods and Supplies or
Service available under the Contract will not meet a nonrecurring special need
of the County.
      4.   Intent to Use. If a multiple source award is anticipated prior to
issuing a solicitation, the County shall reserve the right to make such an
award and the criteria for award shall be stated in the solicitation.
      5.   Determination Required. The Director of Purchasing shall make
written determination setting forth the reasons for a multiple source award,
which shall be made a part of the Procurement file.
   C.   Excluded Contracts.
      1.   Employment Contracts. Unless mandated by the County Board no
employment contracts will be held in the Purchasing Department nor will they be
approved or negotiated by the Director of Purchasing.
      2.   HIPPA Contracts. Under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, a HIPAA business associate agreement (BAA) is a
Contract between a HIPAA covered entity and a HIPAA business associate (BA).
The Contract protects personal health information (PHI) in accordance with
HIPAA guidelines and therefore will not be held in the Purchasing Department
nor be part of this Ordinance.

§ 2.64.010 PURPOSE.
   A.   The Illinois General Assembly has enacted the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act, as amended, (hereinafter the "Act"), which is a
comprehensive revision of State statutes regulating ethical conduct, political
activities, the solicitation and acceptance of gifts by State officials and
employees, and prohibiting sexual harassment.
   B.   The Act requires all units of local government to adopt ordinances or
resolutions regulating the political activities of, and the solicitation and
acceptance of gifts by, the officers and employees of such units and
prohibiting sexual harassment “in a manner no less restrictive” than the
provisions of the Act.
   C.   The clear intention of the Act to require units of local government to
implement regulations that are at least as restrictive as those contained in
the Act, and to impose penalties for violations of those regulations that are
equivalent to those imposed by the Act, notwithstanding that such penalties may
exceed the general authority granted to units of local government to penalize
ordinance violations.
   D.   The clear intention of the Act to provide units of local government
with all authority necessary to implement its requirements on the local level
regardless of any general limitations on the power to define and punish
ordinance violations that might otherwise be applicable.

§ 2.64.050 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   A.   All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual
harassment. No employee, employee of an officer, or an officer shall sexually
harass any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof
while acting within the scope of their employment, during compensated time, or
while on the property of the County of McHenry.
   B.   Sexual harassment, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and the Illinois Department for Human Rights, and for purposes of
this Ordinance, consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual
favors, other verbal, nonverbal, or physical acts of a sexual or sex-based
nature, where:
      l.   submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an employee, employee of an officer, or an officer's
employment;
      2.   an employment decision affecting an employee, employee of an
officer, or an officer is based on that employee, employee of an officer, or
officer's acceptance or rejection of such conduct; or
      3.   such conduct interferes with an employee, employee of an officer, or
an officer's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
working environment.
   C.   Sexual harassment can occur between men and women or between members of
the same gender. This behavior is unacceptable in the workplace itself and in
other work-related settings such as business trips, court appearances, and
business-related social events.
   D.   Harassment affects the victim and other employees as well. Each
incident of harassment contributes to a general atmosphere in which everyone
suffers the consequences. Sexually-oriented or sex-based conduct has no
legitimate business purpose. Where such conduct is directed by a supervisor (or
someone in a higher management position) toward a subordinate, the former will
be held to a higher standard of accountability because of the degree of control
and influence he or she has or is perceived to have over the employment
conditions and benefits of the subordinate.
   E.   Prohibited Conduct. Prohibited acts of sexual harassment can take a
variety of forms ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or contact to
physical contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct
is offensive or harassing to others. Examples of conduct which could be
considered sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:
      1.   persistent or repeated unwelcome flirting, pressure for dates,
sexual comments, or touching;
      2.   sexually suggestive jokes, gestures, or sounds directed toward
another or sexually oriented or degrading comments about another;
      3.   preferential treatment of an employee, employee of an officer, or an
officer, or a promise of preferential treatment to an employee, employee of an
officer, or an officer, in exchange for dates or sexual conduct; or the denial
or threat of denial of employment, benefits, or advancement for refusal to
consent to sexual advances:
      4.   the open display of sexually oriented pictures, posters, calendars,
reading materials, or other material offensive to others; and
      5.   retaliation against an employee, employee of an officer, or an
officer for reporting or complaining about sexually harassing conduct.

Resources is unable to serve as the Ethics Advisor for the County, the County

               (c)   Applicant’s organization has applied to the IRS for a
determination of tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. (c)(3); (c)(4); or (c)(5),
and that the IRS has not yet issued a final administrative ruling or
determination of this status.
            (6)   Failure to submit the information required by this Section,

However, the applicant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial of a
permit application in accordance with subsection D. below of this Ordinance.

for the period of time requested; provided that a permit shall not be issued
for a period of time in excess of 30 csalendar days, unless specifically

permit, a new permit may be issued to the former permit holder upon submission
of a new application. In such a case, applicants may be permitted to
incorporate by reference any required information or documentation filed with a
previous application.
      2.   If permits are requested for the same public area for the same time
period, the County Administrator’s Office will issue permits on a first-come-
first-serve basis.
      3.   It is the sole prerogative of the County to assign rooms based on
anticipated group size, the nature of the event, and anticipated space needs
for official purposes.

County at least 24 hours in advance of the proposed activities.
      5.   Due to the limitations on facilities and staff, the room

capable of being accomplished by the Facilities Management.

shall be returned to the condition in which they were found.
      8.   The County Administrator’s Office shall initiate action to

building and this use is intended to influence or impede the judicial
proceeding; or
         i.   Is being conducted with a permit issued in response to an
intentionally false or incomplete application. Upon initiating action to
disapprove an application or to cancel an issued permit
for any of the above reasons, the County Administrator’s Office shall:
            (1)   Promptly notify the applicant or permittee (in writing) of
the intent to disapprove or cancel and the reasons for this action; and
            (2)   Inform the applicant of his or her right to appeal the
pending disapproval or cancellation to the Management Services Committee under
subsection D. below of this Ordinance.
   D.   1.   Within seven (7) working days of notification of the initial
decision to disapprove any application, or deny a fee request waiver, or cancel
an issued permit under this Section, the applicant or permittee may appeal to
the Management Services Committee by notifying the Committee, in writing, that
he or she desires to appeal.
      2.   Although a formal hearing or presentation is not required, the
applicant or permittee and the County Administrator shall have the opportunity
to orally state the reasons that the application or cancellation should or
should not be approved. Written materials and documents may also be submitted.
The Management Services Committee shall affirm or reverse the County
Administrator’s determination based on this information. The Management
Services Committee shall affirm or reverse the Administrator’s determination
within ten (10) working days of the date on which the Management Services
Committee received the applicant or permittee’s notification of his or her
desire to appeal. If the Management Services Committee does not rule within
this period, the application will be considered to be approved or the permit
validly issued. Upon reaching a decision on an appeal taken under this Section,
the Management Services Committee shall promptly notify the applicant or
permittee and the County Administrator of the decision and the reasons
therefore. The decision of the Management Services Committee shall be final and
shall represent the last step of administrative remedy available pursuant to
this Ordinance.
   E.   Nothing in this Section shall prevent the County Administrator’s Office
from:
      1.   Reserving the use of public areas of the public buildings for
official County business;
      2.   Setting aside certain days or time for maintenance, construction, or
repair; or
      3.   Preempting an approved use of a public area for official County
business.
   F.   Public areas made available may be used during or after the regular
working hours of County agencies, provided this after hour use will not
interfere with the conduct of County business. When public areas are used by
permittees after normal working hours, all adjacent areas not approved for
after hours usage shall be locked, identified by signs, or physically
barricaded, as appropriate, to restrict the participants’ movements to only
that space or area(s) approved for usage. Appropriate notification of
arrangements shall be made with building security in this regard. Under no
circumstance will an afterhours meeting or event extend past 10:00 p.m.
Security is required at all after-hours events in buildings that have security
on duty during business hours. Arrange Security through the Sheriffs Office for
the Government and Risk Management for the Administration Building.
   G.   The space to be provided under this Section is subject to a fee of
$50.00 for a period of four hours or less. A fee of $100 will be charged for
facility use greater than four hours but less than eight hours. The County
Administrator may waive the fee if circumstances indicate doing so. If a
request for a waiver of the fee is denied, the applicant has the opportunity to
appeal said denial in accordance with subsection D. above of this Ordinance.
   H.   There shall be no alteration to public areas used under this Ordinance.
The permittee must make adequate provisions for the:
      1.   Protection of the safety to users of the public area; and
      2.   Prevention of damage to the public building and County-owned
equipment.
   I.   County-owned equipment, including overhead projectors, VCR’s,
televisions, film projectors, and screens are not available for use.
   J.   The permittee shall not:
      1.   Misrepresent his or her identity;

      3.   Leave leaflets or other material unattended at any place on County-

days after such change takes effect. The licensee shall have 60 days after
notifying the Commissioner to have any new partners or corporate officers

§ 5.08.130 FORM OF LICENSE ISSUED.
   All licenses issued by the Commissioner shall state thereon the name of the
licensee, the address and description of the premises and of the building for
which the license is granted, and the date of its issuance and expiration.
   A.   Where two or more locations, places, or premises are under the same
roof, or are located at one street address, a separate license shall be
obtained for each such location, place, or premises, unless all rooms in which
it is intended to serve alcoholic liquors are directly connected or are
adjacent to, and accessible to each other without leaving the building. Each
licensee shall define with certainty the room or rooms in which liquor is to be
sold.
   B.   Separate license for each premise; transfer to other premises. Licenses
issued hereunder apply only to the premises described in the application and in
the license issued thereon, and only one location shall be so described in each
license. After a license has been granted for particular premises, the State
Commission or the local commissioner, as the case may be, upon proper showing,
may endorse upon said license permission to abandon the premises therein
described and remove there from to other premises approved by him or it, but in
order to obtain such approval the licensee shall file with the State Commission
and local commissioner a request in writing and a statement under oath which
shall show that the premises to which removal is to be made comply in all
respects with the requirements of this Act. A transfer may only be requested to
a premise within the same jurisdiction that issued the original local liquor
license. A transfer fee of $75.00 will be charged for each request.

Ordinance to be framed and hung in plain view in a conspicuous place on the
licensed premises. All licensees shall comply with the State mandated display
of warning signs as cited in the Act.
(Ord. O-201406-12-020, § 14, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 7468, passed 3-19-2019)   
§ 5.08.150 PRIVILEGE GRANTED BY LICENSE— NATURE AS PROPERTY—EXPIRATION OF
LICENSE—NOT LIABLE TO ATTACHMENT, GARNISHMENT OR EXECUTION— TRANSFERABILITY.
   A license shall be purely a personal privilege and shall expire on April
30th next following the date of issuance, unless sooner revoked as in this
Ordinance provided, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject
to attachment, garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable or
transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or
hypothecated. Such license shall not descend by laws of testate or intestate
devolution, but it shall cease upon death of the licensee, provided that
executors or administrators of an estate of any deceased licensee, and a
trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in
part of alcoholic liquor, may continue the business of the sale or manufacture
of alcoholic liquor under order of an appropriate court, and may exercise the
privileges of the deceased or such insolvency or bankruptcy until expiration of
such license but not longer than six months after the death, bankruptcy or
insolvency of such licensee.

§ 5.08.160 RENEWAL OF LICENSES.
   A.   Any licensee may renew his license at the expiration thereof, provided
he is qualified to receive a license and the premise for which such renewal
license is sought is suitable for such purpose; and provided further that the
renewal privilege herein provided for shall not be construed as a vested right
which shall in any case prevent the McHenry County Board from decreasing the
number of licenses to be issued within McHenry County.
   B.   Any license issued to a corporation for profit shall terminate upon
transfer of ownership from one individual or individuals to another of more
than thirty percent (30%) of the corporation stock, and any application for
renewal of the license in the corporation’s name subsequent to transfer of the
ownership of more than thirty percent (30%) of the corporate stock shall be
considered and treated as a new application.
   C.   Whenever a non-corporate licensee under this Ordinance forms a
corporation to operate in lieu of said licensee, a new application and fee is
required, even when the shareholder or shareholders of said corporation and the
licensee or licensees are one and the same persons (see §
5.08.100C.).
   D.   Failure to apply for renewal of a liquor license and to accompany such
renewal application with an appropriate fee by the expiration date of the
present valid liquor license may be considered by the Commission as a decision
not to renew.
   E.   Every submitted renewal license shall be in all respects identical with
the previous year’s license and application. Applications for renewal licenses
shall be made in the same manner except that a statement shall be endorsed on
the face of the renewal application that such application is for renewal.
Submittal of renewal applications must be filed with the Commissioner no less
than 30 days prior to the expiration of the license. Failure to meet submittal
deadlines could result in a lapse of liquor license, denial of a renewal, and/
or a fine.
   F.   Renewal applications determined to be identical shall be submitted for
the Commissioner’s signature and subsequently issued a renewal license unless
the Commissioner requests that application for renewal be submitted to the Law
& Government/ Liquor Committee for review and recommendation. Should the
application for a renewal license fail to be identical to the previous year’s
application, that application and liquor license may be submitted to the Law &
Government/Liquor Committee for review and recommendation.

of non-age of a prospective recipient, he shall, before making such sale or
delivery, demand presentation of written evidence of age and identity of the
person in a document issued by a Federal, State, county or municipal

§ 5.28.030 INTENT.
   The County finds that the development of cable communications systems has
the potential of great benefit and impact upon its Residents. Because of the
complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the
County finds that the public health, safety and general welfare can best be
served by establishing certain regulatory powers in the County as this
Ordinance shall designate. It is the intent of this Ordinance to provide for
the means to attain the best possible communication and developmental results
in the public interest and for such public purpose in these matters. Any
Franchise granted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be deemed to include these
findings as an integral part thereof.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)
§ 5.28.040 FRANCHISE TERRITORY.
   A.   Franchise granted under this Ordinance is for the Service Area as it
may exist now and in the future as well as rights-of-way under the jurisdiction
of the County.
   B.   A Grantee shall offer service to all Residents and designated public
buildings within the Service Area without regard to the race, religion,
national origin, income, disability status, age or gender of the Resident.
Further, the Grantee shall offer services to commercial areas within the
Service Area. A Grantee shall not impose any charge upon any Subscriber within
the Service Area for extending the Cable System to the Subscriber’s location.
   C.   A Grantee shall offer service and rates on a non-discriminatory basis
with regards to deposits and service packages to all Residents. However, a
Grantee may offer discounted rates to senior citizens. A Grantee may, however,
discontinue or refuse service to Subscribers and potential Subscribers who have
not paid applicable charges. A Grantee may offer services to commercial
Subscribers at rates different from those charged Residential Subscribers. The
Grantee may also enter into separate contracts with Multiple Dwelling Unit
buildings and may charge discounted rates for services based upon single point
billing or other contractual considerations. This does not preclude a Grantee
from offering promotional rates for service introductions or temporary
promotional discounts within the Service Area or offering rates and services in
a non-uniform manner as allowed by Federal law.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)

   G.   Ordinance revisions. Any Franchise granted under this Ordinance is

and incidental fees incurred or charged to the County for renewal of the
Franchise.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)
§ 5.28.080 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   A.   Any Franchise granted under this Ordinance shall be a privilege to be
held for the benefit of the public. Any Franchise so granted cannot, in any
event, be sold, transferred, used as collateral for any loan or loans, leased
or sublet, assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, or other means, nor shall title thereto,
either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, pass or
vest in any person, without the prior written consent of the County, and then
only under such conditions as the County may establish as permitted by law.
Such consent as required by the County shall be given or denied no later than
120 days following submission of all information required by this §
5.28.080 and by FCC regulations. Prior consent shall not be required when
transferring the Franchise between wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same
entity.
   B.   A Grantee shall promptly notify, in writing, the County of any proposed
change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, Control of the
Grantee or the Cable System. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of
Control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer by any entity
or group of entities of five percent or more of the beneficial ownership
interest of the Grantee or the Cable System or where any transaction would
require FCC consent. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of Control of the
Grantee or the Cable System shall make the Franchise subject to cancellation
unless and until the County shall have consented in writing thereto. For the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or
acquisition of Control, the County may inquire into the legal, technical and
financial qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee
shall assist the County in any such inquiry.
   C.   In seeking the County’s consent to any change in ownership or Control,
the Grantee shall have the responsibility:
      1.   To show, to the satisfaction of the County, whether the proposed
purchaser, transferree, or assignee (the “Proposed Transferee”), which in the
case of a corporation, shall include all directors and all entities having a
legal or equitable interest in five percent or more of the voting stock:
         a.   Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral
turpitude including, but not limited to, any violation of federal, state or
local law or regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation or
complaint charging such acts; or
         b.   Has ever had a judgement in an action for fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation entered against it, her, him or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or
         c.   Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative proceeding
arising out of or involving a Cable System.
      2.   To establish, to the satisfaction of the County, the financial
solvency of the Proposed Transferee by submitting all relevant current
financial data for the Proposed Transferee which the Grantee was required to
submit in its Franchise application and such other relevant financial data as
the County may request. Financial statements shall be audited, certified and
qualified by a Certified Public Accountant.
      3.   To establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of the County, that the
financial and technical capability of the Proposed Transferee is such as shall
enable it to maintain and operate the Cable System for the remaining term of
the Franchise under the existing Franchise terms.
   D.   The parties to the sale, transfer or assignment shall make a written
request to the County for its approval of a sale, transfer or delegation,
including all applicable information required by FCC regulations and this
section. Upon receipt of a complete written request with all application
information, including any additional information specifically required by this
Ordinance, the County shall have 120 calendar days to approve or deny the
written request. The County may request that additional information related to
the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the Proposed Transferee be
provided to the County consistent with Federal law and regulation. A
determination as to whether a public hearing is necessary shall be made by the
County. If a public hearing is deemed necessary by the County, such hearing
shall commence within 30 days of such determination, and notice of any such
hearing shall be given 14 calendar days prior to the hearing by publishing
notice thereof and delivering a copy of same to the Grantee by certified mail,
return receipt requested. The notice shall contain the date, time and place of
the hearing, and shall briefly state the substance of the action to be
considered by the County. Said public hearing does not toll the 120-day period
set forth hereinabove. The Board shall then decide to approve or deny the
written request. The fees arising from such hearing shall be borne jointly and
severally by the Grantee and the Proposed Transferree.
   E.   At the close of any transfer, sale or assignment of the Grantee or the
Cable System, as the case maybe, the Grantee shall file with the County a copy
of the deed, agreement, mortgage, lease or other written instrument evidencing
such sale, transfer of ownership or control, or lease or assignment, certified
and sworn to as correct by the Grantee.
   F.   Any financial institution having a pledge of the Franchise or its
assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of
the Franchise shall have the right to notify the County that it, or its
designee as approved in writing by the County, shall take control and operate
the Cable System in the event of a Grantee default in its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all
Franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the System. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the System for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the County
in its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right to
petition the County to transfer the Franchise to another Grantee. Except
insofar as the enforceability of this §
5.28.080F. maybe limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and further
subject to applicable federal, state or local law, if the County finds that
such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and
other public interest qualities of the Proposed Transferee are satisfactory,
the County shall transfer and assign the right and obligations of such
Franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the County to such transfer
shall be given or denied no less than 120 days following the submission of all
information required by this §
5.28.080 and in accordance with FCC regulations and Federal law.
   G.   The consent or approval of the County to any transfer by a Grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the County in and to
the Streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of this Ordinance and the Franchise Agreement, if any.
   H.   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or Control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the Franchise
Agreement, if any.
   I.   The County may approve the transfer, or deny the transfer or
conditionally approve the transfer. The conditions the County may attach to the
transfer approval may include, but are not limited to: reimbursement for any
and all expenses and fees incurred by or charged to the County by any engineer,
planner, attorney, economist or other technical or professional expert
assisting the County in evaluating the transfer request or the Proposed
Transferee; remedy of any existing or historical violations of County
ordinances, this Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement, if any; payment of all
fees, penalties, liquidated damages or other compensation owed by the Grantee
at the time of transfer approval; and a guarantee by the prospective new
Grantee to abide by any and all ordinances, agreements and conditions placed
upon the Franchise and System by the County.
   J.   Grantee hereby agrees that when the Grantee approves a transfer under
this §
5.28.080, the new Grantee shall indicate acceptance of the Franchise as
specified herein, including the filing of all necessary proof of insurance and
certifications and letter of credit.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)
§ 5.28.090 FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the County shall not approve
any transfer or assignment of the Franchise prior to completion of initial
construction of the Cable System. The County may decide to renew the Franchise
granted under this Ordinance if the Grantee files a written request for such a
renewal. At the time of such request, the County may update this Ordinance and
reevaluate the needs of the community for Cable Service and the performance of
the Grantee. Any renewal of the Franchise shall be in accordance with § 626 of
the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546), as amended, and the following:
      1.   To the extent applicable, the Cable Act shall govern the procedures
and standards for renewal of any Franchise.
      2.   To the extent that the Cable Act is not applicable, the County, in
its sole discretion and judgement, shall have the right to grant, deny or
conditionally grant renewal of a Franchise.
      3.   The conditions that the County may place on its approval shall
include, but are not limited to: reimbursement for expenses incurred in
evaluating the request for renewal, updating this Ordinance and surveying
community needs, remedy of historical or existing violations of County
ordinances, this Ordinance and the Franchise Agreement, if any, payment of all
monies and fines owed and payment of the County’s professional expenses,
including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees incurred in processing and
considering the renewal of the Franchise.
      4.   When the County approves a Franchise renewal, the Grantee shall
accept the renewed Franchise under the procedures set out in §
5.28.070 of this Ordinance.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)
§ 5.28.100 FRANCHISE FEE.
   A.   1.   In consideration of the privilege granted under this Franchise for
the operation of a Cable Communications System, and the expense of
administration pursuant to the Franchise incurred by the County, a Grantee
shall pay to the County an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Gross
Revenues of the Grantee, or such other maximum amount allowed by applicable law
(the “Franchise Fee”).
      2.   The Grantee shall furnish, on an annual basis, a statement within
120 days of the close of the calendar year, audited and certified by an
independent CPA, reflecting the total amount of the Gross Revenue and all
payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment.
Such statement shall be accompanied by a certification identifying the
independent CPA and a covenant that such CPA has no financial or equitable
interest in the Grantee. Upon 15 days’ prior written notice, the County shall
have the right to conduct an independent audit of the Grantee’s records related
to the computation of the Franchise Fee. All records necessary for such audit
shall be made available to the County or its designee at the County’s offices.
If such records cannot be made available at a local office within the County,
then the Grantee shall pay all reasonable costs associated with providing the
County, or the County’s agent, access to such records. If such audit indicates
a Franchise Fee underpayment of three percent or more, the Grantee shall
promptly pay all of the County’s costs of such an audit; any Franchise Fee
underpayment shall be paid to the County within 15 days after Grantee is
furnished with a copy of said audit. After such time, the County may deduct the
amount of such underpayment from the Grantee’s letter of credit.
   B.   Acceptance by the County. No acceptance of any payment by the County
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the County may have for further or additional sums payable as a Franchise Fee
or for the performance of any other obligations of the Grantee.
   C.   Failure to Make Required Payment. In the event that any Franchise Fee
or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, the
Grantee shall pay as additional compensation:
      1.   An interest charge, computed from such due date, of 10 percent per
annum during the period for which the payment was due.
      2.   If the payment is late by 45 days or more, an additional sum of
money equal to ten percent of the amount due in order to defray those
additional expenses and costs incurred by the County by reason of the
delinquent payment.

by the 15th day of the following month after each calendar quarter. Time is of
the essence.

law or regulation concerning Subscriber service or consumer protection that
imposes Subscriber service or consumer protection requirements that exceed the

the number of Subscribers’ complaints regarding consumer service performance by
a Grantee received by the Grantee and/or the County and the Grantee’s response
to those complaints. The County’s evaluation that service quality is inadequate
may lead to direction to Grantee to cure the inadequacies. The Grantee shall
respond to any inadequacy claim within 10 days after receipt of written notice.
Failure to do so shall be deemed a breach of the Franchise and subject the
Grantee to the remedies prescribed in this Ordinance and the Franchise
Agreement, if any. The County may draw upon the letter of credit provided for
in this Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement, if any, to remedy any such
Franchise breach.
   C.   Service to All Residents.

essence with respect to this obligation. In the event such obligation is not
completed within such six-month interval, such failure shall constitute a
violation of this Ordinance rendering the Grantee liable to a penalty of
$250.00 per day for each day such violation continues. Such penalty maybe
deducted from the Grantee’s letter of credit by the County.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)

the Cable Act and applicable law.

each test shall be submitted to the County of same. The tests may be witnessed
by representatives of the County and written test reports shall be submitted to
the County. If more than ten percent (10%) of the locations tested fail to meet
the performance standards, the Grantee shall be required to indicate what
corrective measures have been taken, and the entire test shall be repeated. A
second failure of more than ten percent (10%) shall be considered a violation
of this Ordinance.
      3.   Special Tests. At any time after commencement of service to
Subscribers, the County may require additional tests, full or partial repeat
tests, different test procedures, or tests involving a specific Subscriber’s
terminal. Requests for such additional tests will be made on the basis of
complaints received or other evidence indicating an unresolved complaint or
significant noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to the particular
matter in controversy. The County shall endeavor to so arrange its requests for
such special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to a Grantee or
to the Subscriber.
      4.   Costs of tests. The costs of all tests required under Subsection 2.
above, and retesting as necessary, shall be borne by the Grantee, except that
if the County requires the utilization of outside consultants or test personnel
such costs shall be borne by the Grantee as well. Costs of all tests under
Subsection 3. shall be borne by the Grantee.
   D.   Books and Records. The County, upon reasonable notice to the Grantee,
may review the Grantee’s books and records as is reasonably necessary to ensure
compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and the Franchise Agreement, if
any. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public
records required to be kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the FCC. The Grantee shall not be required to provide Subscriber
information in violation of § 631 of the Cable Act.
(Ord. O-200203-12-002, passed 3-5-2002)
§ 5.28.130 COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.
   A.   Complaints to Grantee. A Grantee shall establish written procedures for
receiving, acting upon and resolving Subscriber complaints without intervention
by the County. The procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a Subscriber
may submit a complaint, either orally or in writing. These procedures shall be
provided to the County along with any updates to same. At the conclusion of a
Grantee’s investigation of a Subscriber complaint, but in no event more than 10
calendar days after receiving the complaint, the Grantee shall notify the
Subscriber of the results of the investigation and its proposed action or
resolution, if any. Complete records of the Grantee’s actions in response to
all complaints shall be kept. Each report must include the name and address of
the reporting Subscriber, the date and time each report was made, a detailed
explanation of the complaint or service request, and the action taken by
Grantee. The Grantee shall also notify the Subscriber of the Subscriber’s right
to file a complaint with the County in the event the Subscriber is dissatisfied
with the Grantee’s decision.
   B.   Complaints to the County. A Subscriber who is dissatisfied with the
Grantee’s proposed decision shall be entitled to have the complaint reviewed by
the County. The Subscriber shall initiate the review by filing a complaint,
together with the Grantee’s decision, if any, with the County. The County will
notify the Grantee of the filing and provide Grantee a copy of the filing,
together with all documentation. The Subscriber shall make such filing and
notification within 20 days of receipt of Grantee’s decision or, if no decision
from the Grantee has been provided, within 30 days after filing the original
complaint with Grantee. The County may extend these time limits for reasonable
cause.
   C.   Review by the County. The County’s staff or its designee shall
determine, upon a review of a Subscriber complaint and the Grantee’s decision,
if any, whether further action is warranted. If the County decides to initiate
further investigation, it shall require the Grantee and the Subscriber to
submit, within 10 days of notice thereof, a statement of the facts and
arguments in support of their respective positions. The County’s staff shall
issue a written recommendation to the Board within 15 days of receipt of the
statements or, if a hearing is requested, within 15 days of the conclusion of
the hearing, setting forth the basis of the recommendation. In turn, the Board
shall render a decision after reviewing the written recommendation from the
County’s staff.
   D.   Complaint File and Reports. An accurate and comprehensive file shall be
kept by the Grantee of any and all complaints regarding the Cable System for
the last twelve (12) months. A procedure shall be established by the Grantee by
the time of Installation of the Cable System to remedy complaints quickly and
reasonably to the satisfaction of the Subscriber. Complete records of a
Grantee’s actions in response to all complaints shall be kept including, but
not limited to the following:
      1.   A summary of service requests, identifying the number and nature of
the requests and their disposition;
      2.   A log and summary of all major service outages;
      3.   The results of a annual opinion survey report which identifies
satisfaction or dissatisfaction among Subscribers with Cable Service offered by
the Grantee, which shall be submitted to the County within three (3) months
after such test results are compiled. The survey required to make said report
shall be in a form that can be transmitted to Subscribers with one or more
bills for service, such as postage-paid self-addressed post cards. At the
Grantee’s expense, the County may prepare the survey form and request its
inclusion with a monthly bill to Subscribers;
      4.   An accurate and comprehensive file of all complaints regarding the
Cable System that are forwarded to the Grantee from the County. The Grantee
will continue its procedures to remedy complaints quickly and reasonably.
Complete records of the Grantee’s actions in response to all such complaints
shall be kept for a period of at least one year.
   E.   Remedies for Violations. The County may, as a part of a Subscriber
complaint decision issued under the provisions of this Ordinance and the
Franchise Agreement, if any, impose penalties or damages, as the case may be,
on the Grantee. Such penalties or damages, as the case may be, may be deducted
from the Grantee’s letter of credit by the County. In addition, the County may
require the Grantee to reduce the affected Subscriber’s cable bill by an amount
consistent with the Grantee’s written decision and designed to compensate the
Subscriber for any loss of services, damages sustained and the filing of the
complaint. These remedies are in addition to and not exclusive of any other
remedy which may be applicable under this Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement,
if any, or federal, state or local law.
   F.   Report of Complaints. The reports required under this §
5.28.130 shall be provided to the County upon request and not less than
quarterly if so requested by the County.

§ 5.28.150 INSTALLATION, RECONNECTION AND SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION.
   A.   Standard Installation. Standard installation shall consist of a service
drop not exceeding 250 feet from a single pole or pedestal attachment to the
Subscriber’s Dwelling Unit. Service in excess of 250 feet and wiring placed
underground at a Subscriber’s request, which is not otherwise required to be
placed underground by the provisions of this Ordinance or the Franchise
Agreement, if any, or other applicable ordinance, law or regulation, and any
Subscriber request for concealing of the cable wire within the walls of a
Dwelling Unit beyond what is involved in a standard installation, shall be
charged in accordance with FCC rules and regulations. The Subscriber shall be
notified in writing of the estimated additional installation costs before
installation begins. The desire of the Subscriber as to the point of entry into
the Dwelling Unit in connection with any Installation shall be observed
wherever possible. If the Subscriber chooses the point of entry into the
Dwelling Unit, the Subscriber may be charged the added expense of changing the
point of entry pursuant to FCC rules. Runs in building interiors shall be as
unobtrusive as possible. The Grantee shall use due care in the process of
Installation and shall repair any damage to the Subscriber’s property caused by
the Installation. Restoration shall be undertaken within seven days after the
damage is incurred and shall be completed as soon as possible. Unless weather
conditions prohibit immediate restoration, restoration shall begin within two
days after weather conditions permit.
   B.   Restoration of Service. The Grantee shall restore service to any
potential Subscriber wishing restoration of service, provided the potential
Subscriber shall first satisfy any previous obligations owed.
   C.   Extensions of Service. The Grantee shall provide a Standard
Installation to any Dwelling Unit or public building located within the Service
Area within seven days of a request for service. The Grantee shall not impose
any charge upon any Subscriber located within the Service Area for extending
the Cable System to Subscribers’ locations, except as set forth explicitly in
this Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement, if any. The Grantee shall extend the
Cable System as necessary to provide service to the Service Area. To expedite
the process of extending the Cable System into a new subdivision, the County
may choose to forward to a Grantee an approved engineering plan of each
project. The Grantee shall commence the design and construction process upon
receipt of the final engineering plan. The Grantee shall complete the
construction/activation process prior to occupancy of the building(s) in such
new subdivision receiving Cable Service.
   D.   Use of Streets. For the purposes of operating and maintaining a Cable
System in the Service Area, the Grantee may erect, install, construct, repair,
replace, reconstruct and retain in and under the Streets, lines, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary and
appurtenant to the operation of the System, subject to the County engineer’s
approval of the location of same and provided that all applicable permits are
applied for and granted, all fees paid and all other generally applicable
County codes, resolutions, practices, procedures and ordinances are otherwise
complied with. However, no rights hereunder may be transferred by the Grantee
to any other entity except the Grantee’s construction agents. The Grantee shall
pay all charges incurred by the County in reviewing any permit application,
engineering plan, inspections, etc., including, but not limited to, the
County’s attorneys’ fees and engineering consulting fees.
   E.   Filing of Plans. Prior to construction or alteration, the Grantee shall
in each case file plans with the County engineer and receive written approval
of such plans from same. The Grantee shall provide in writing a monthly
progress report to the County through the completion of construction or
alteration at the request of the County. It shall be the sole responsibility of
the Grantee to identify and verify property lines, easement lines, rights-of-
ways and other similar property boundaries.
   F.   Non-interference. The Grantee shall construct and maintain the Cable
System so as not to interfere with other present or future uses of Streets,
sewer mains, water mains and other County facilities and infrastructure. The
Grantee shall individually notify all Residents directly affected by proposed
construction prior to the commencement of that work. If the County determines,
at any time, that any portion of the Cable System unduly interferes with other
uses of the Streets, sewer mains, water mains and other County facilities and/
or infrastructure, the Grantee shall take any necessary action, as directed by
the County, to alleviate or terminate the interference.
   G.   Underground Street Crossing. Whenever a Grantee must place the Cable
System or other facilities beneath the traveled or paved portion of the Streets
or other public ways, unless otherwise approved in advance by the County, the
Grantee shall do so by directional boring and not by excavation of a trench in
which to place cable conduit. Directional boring shall be done wherever
possible so that the excavations necessary for it are not in the paved portion
of the Street or other right-of-way.
   H.   Pavement Cut Coordination and Additional Fees. A Grantee shall
coordinate its construction program and all other work in the Streets with the
County’s program for Street construction, rebuilding and resurfacing. The
Grantee shall meet with the County prior to any Street cut.
      1.   The goals of such coordination shall be to require the Grantee to
conduct all work in the Streets in conjunction with or immediately prior to any
Street resurfacing planned by the County, and to prevent a Street from being
disturbed by the Grantee after it has been constructed, rebuilt, resurfaced or
repaired.
      2.   The Grantee shall not cut or otherwise breach or damage the surface
of any Street within 16 months after such Street has been resurfaced.
      3.   The County may waive the preceding requirement due to circumstances,
such as where there is no feasible alternative for construction of the Cable
System in its sole and unfettered discretion.
   I.   Denial of Use by the County. Notwithstanding the grant to use the
Streets in §
5.28.150 herein, no Street shall be used by the Grantee if the County, in its
sole opinion and discretion, determines that such use is inconsistent with the
conditions or provisions by which such Street was created or dedicated or
presently used.
   J.   Restoration of Streets.
      1.   In the event any Street or other public place is disturbed, the
Grantee shall, within seven days, weather permitting, at its own cost and
expense and in a manner approved by the County engineer, replace and restore
such area in as good a condition as before the work involving such a
disturbance was done except that any pavement opening shall be closed within 24
hours.
      2.   All restoration or reconstruction shall comply with all generally
applicable ordinances, resolutions practices and procedures of the County.
   K.   Tree Trimming. The Grantee shall comply with the provisions of any
County ordinance regulating the removal, destruction or trimming of trees or
vegetation of any kind. The Grantee shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the County and its officers, agents and
employees from and against any and all damages arising out of or resulting from
the removal, trimming, mutilation of or injury to any tree or vegetation caused
by the Grantee or its officers, agents, employees, contractors or
subcontractors. No removal, destruction or trimming of any vegetation shall
occur without 15 days’ advance written notice to the County and the prior
written consent of Grantee and, in the case of vegetation on private property,
notice to the relevant property owner.
   L.   Consent to Erection of Poles. No Franchise shall be deemed to expressly
or implicitly authorize the Grantee to construct or install poles or wire-
holding structures within Streets for the purpose of placing cables, wires,
lines or otherwise without the written consent of the County which may be
withheld in the County’s sole and unfettered discretion.
   M.   Underground Installation Required. The Grantee shall construct and
install its cables, wires and other facilities underground. Amplifier boxes and
pedestal mounted terminal boxes maybe placed aboveground if existing technology
reasonably requires it, but shall be of such size and design and shall be so
located, to the extent possible, as not to be unsightly or unsafe.
   N.   Utility Crowding. In areas where the County finds the Streets will not
readily accommodate further underground facilities, the County may require the
Grantee’s conduits be oversized, duplicated or placed in multiple configuration
and the Grantee shall share the use of its underground conduits and multiple
configurations at such locations at reasonable rates.
   O.   Relocation Underground. With respect to any cables, wires and other
like facilities constructed and installed by a Grantee aboveground, the Grantee
shall, at its sole expense, reconstruct and reinstall such cables, wires or
other facilities underground pursuant to any project under which the cables,
wires or other like facilities of other utilities are placed underground within
an area.
   P.   Property Damage. The Grantee shall use due care in the process of
Installation, or in any service performed at any time, and shall repair and
restore, at the Grantee’s cost and expense, any damage or injury to any
property caused in any way by any act or omission of the Grantee or any of its
agents. The Grantee shall return the property to the same condition as before
the damage occurred within seven days after the damage is incurred. If weather
conditions prohibit restoration within seven days, restoration shall begin
within two days after weather conditions permit restoration. If the Grantee
fails to effectuate said repair or restoration in the time specified, the owner
of the property, or his/her designee, may notify, via certified mail, return
receipt requested, the Grantee of such owner’s intent to repair or restore the
property. If the Grantee fails to repair or restore the property within 7
calendar days from the date the notice was mailed, the owner may proceed to
complete the repair or restoration. The Grantee shall pay the owner the cost of
the repair or restoration within seven business days after receiving invoices
or receipts for the repairs or restoration.
   Q.   Removing, Relocating Installed Facilities. If, during the term of the
Franchise, the County or any other local government having relevant
jurisdiction, a public utility, a sanitary district or any other similar
special district elects to alter, repair, realign, abandon, improve, vacate,
reroute or change the grade of any Street or to replace, repair, install,
maintain or otherwise alter any aboveground or underground cable, wire,
conduit, pipe, line pole, wire-holding structure or other facility utilized for
the provisions of utility or other services or transportation or drainage,
sewage or other liquids, the Grantee, shall, except as otherwise hereinafter
provided, at its sole expense, remove or relocate as necessary its poles,
wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and any other facilities which it
has installed. If such removal or relocation is required within the subdivision
in which all utility lines, including those for the System, were installed at
the same time, the entities may decide among themselves who is to bear the
relocation costs; provided, that the County shall not be liable to a Grantee
for such costs. Regardless of who bears the costs, a Grantee shall take action
to remove or relocate at such time or times as are directed by the entity
undertaking the work. Reasonable advance written notice shall be mailed to the
Grantee advising the Grantee of the date or dates that the removal or
relocation is to be undertaken.
   R.   Relocation at Request of Third Party. The Grantee shall, at the request
of any person holding a building or moving permit issued by the County,
temporarily raise or lower its wires, provided: (I) the expense of such
temporary raising or lowering of wires is paid by said person, and (ii) the
Grantee is given not less than five (5) business days advance written notice to
arrange for such temporary wire changes.
   S.   Standards and Performance Tests. The Grantee shall construct, install
and maintain its System in a manner consistent and in compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements,
and technical standards equivalent to those established by the FCC. The Grantee
shall provide to the County written reports of the Grantee’s annual proof of
performance tests conducted pursuant to FCC standards and requirements.
   T.   Codes and Regulations. The Grantee shall at all times comply with the
most recent edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (established by the
National Bureau of Standards), National Electrical Code, National Bureau of
Fire Underwriters, all applicable FCC and federal, state and local ordinances,
regulations, resolutions, practices and procedures of general applicability and
codes and other ordinances of the County.
   U.   Safety. The System shall not endanger or interfere with the safety of
persons or property within the County or other areas where a Grantee may have
equipment located.
   V.   Notice of Construction to Residents. A Grantee shall provide advance
notice, appropriate to the circumstances, prior to entry whenever desiring to
enter or cross any private property within the County or work in abutting
Streets, except in the day-to-day operations of the Cable System (e.g.
Installations and service calls). By way of example, the Grantee shall provide
at least 48 hours advance notice to affected property owners (such as by door
hangers) prior to construction or reconstruction requiring entry on private
property or work in the Streets abutting such private property. During
maintenance work, installation work and outage repair, the Grantee shall
attempt to notify affected Residents (such as by knocking and, if no answer,
leaving a door hanger) prior to entering private property. Work performed in an
emergency in Streets to repair the System is exempt from this §
5.28.150V.
   W.   OSHA. All working facilities, conditions and procedures, used or
occurring during construction and maintenance of the System, shall comply with
the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   X.   Workmanship. Construction, installation and maintenance of the Cable
System shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner utilizing materials
of good and durable quality. The Grantee shall work in close coordination with
public and private utilities serving the County, following accepted
construction procedures and practices and working through existing committees
and organizations.
   Y.   Cable and Wire Installation. All cable and wires shall be installed,
where possible, parallel with electric and telephone lines, and multiple cable
configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect for
engineering considerations. The Grantee shall install its Cable System such
that it is easily distinguishable from any other cable providers, utilities,
etc., and service providers (i.e., color code its System, stamp or attach tags
to the System).
   Z.   Antenna. Any antenna structure used in the System shall comply with
construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures required by the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
   AA.   Signals. Signal leakage shall be checked at reception locations for
emergency radio services so as to prove no interference signal combinations are
possible.
   BB.   Radiation. Radiation shall be measured adjacent to any proposed
aeronautical navigation or communication radio sites to prove no interference
to air navigational reception.
   CC.   Undergrounding of Cable System Lines. To the extent it is necessary
that Cable System lines must cross through Streets, they shall be installed
underground. With respect to those Cable System lines which are situated upon
any Street, a Grantee shall install such lines underground at the Grantee’s
cost within six months from the acceptance of a Franchise or renewal thereof.
In the event such obligation is not completed within such six month interval,
such failure shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance rendering the
Grantee liable to a penalty of $250.00 per day for each day the violation
continues. Such penalty may be deducted from the Grantee’s letter of credit by
the County.

Department, or in any other way has blatantly jeopardized the public’s health
by his manner of response to such notice, said Health Authority may without
warning, notice or hearing, issue a written notice to the permit holder, owner
or operator, citing such conditions and such order shall state the permit is

compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, the permit shall be
reinstated.

and directly into the seepage field.
   G.   Clear Water Discharges. Clear water wastes may be discharged directly
to storm sewers, natural drainage areas, or to the ground surface without
additional treatment provided that it does not conflict with any State or local
drainage law. Such drainage shall not result in nuisance conditions which
create an offensive odor, or which produce a stagnant wet area, or which
produce an environment for the breeding of insects.
   H.   Swimming Pools. Wastewater from swimming pools may not be discharged to
a private sewage disposal system receiving domestic sewage. Wash or backwash
water from swimming pool sand filters may be discharged to natural drainage

the separation of water supply lines and sewer lines:
      1.   Horizontal Separation. Sewers shall be installed at least 10 feet
horizontally from any existing or proposed water line. When local conditions
prevent a lateral separation of 10 feet, a sewer may be laid closer than 10
feet to a water line provided that the elevation of the crown of the sewer is
at least 18 inches below the invert of the water line, and the sewer line is
Schedule 40 or heavier material with watertight joints.
      2.   Crossings. Where sewer lines must cross water lines, the sewer line
shall be laid at such an elevation that the crown of the sewer line is at least
18 inches below the invert of the water line. This vertical separation shall be
maintained for that portion of the sewer line located within 10 feet
horizontally of any water line it crosses. When sewer lines must cross above
water lines, the sewer lines shall be Schedule 40 or heavier material with
watertight joints.
   K.   Permit Required. No private sewage disposal system shall be
constructed, replaced, modified, altered, extended or repaired until a permit

achieved within said period, the permit shall expire unless an extension is
approved by the Health Authority. The permit can be renewed for a period of 6
(six) months for 1/2 of the prevailing permit fee, provided all the conditions
of the original submittal remain valid. Where a septic system is required for a
structure, no building permit shall be issued without the prior or simultaneous
issuance of a septic permit. No private sewage disposal system shall be put
into use until it has been approved by the Health Authority.
   L.   No Permit Required. No permit is required when the nature of a repair
is so minor as to not influence the size or substantially alter the function of
the system (i.e., broken vent pipe, settling of distribution box, etc.).
Replacement of seepage stone, gravelless seepage system or perforated pipe in
the seepage area of the septic system requires a permit for repair or
replacement.

§ 8.04.420 FIELD EXAMINATION OF SITE SOIL MATERIALS.
   A.   Soil Investigation. Determination of soil characteristics on sites
proposed for development with private sewage disposal systems shall be based on
soil boring data collected by a soil classifier. Each property owner or
applicant shall contract with a soil classifier, to identify soil
characteristics and classifications for the purpose of reporting soil
suitability potential for soil absorption systems. The Department shall utilize
NRCS for periodic quality control sessions with all classifiers available for
the performance of on-site soil evaluations, and for needed soils expertise to
the Department in connection with the needs of this Ordinance.
   B.   Boring Criteria. There shall be a minimum of three (3) suitable borings
per soil absorption system site. More soil borings may be necessary for
accurate and appropriate evaluation of a site where there is some concern about
the consistency of the soil materials. One of the borings shall be made at the
lowest portion of the proposed absorption field area. Such borings shall extend
at least five (5) feet below the natural ground surface or greater if needed,
based on the proposed system design. The proposed subsurface seepage system
shall be located within the area of the soil borings. Soil borings shall be
valid for one year after the test date, after which time an update is required
by the soil classifier.
   C.   Soil Pits. Observation and determination of soil characteristics may
also be determined from a pit dug by a backhoe or other excavating equipment.
Soil pits (backhoe excavation) shall be required in cases where ground is
frozen, where the soil materials are considerably varied in texture, where
there has been filling or proposed cutting of soils, or where trenches are
proposed deeper than normally considered, etc. Such soil pits shall be prepared
at the perimeter of the expected soil absorption area to minimize damage to
natural soil distribution network that may be caused by settling after
installation of the system. Soil pits shall be at least two (2) feet wide and
five (5) feet deep.
   D.   Site Characteristics. Site characteristics to be described include
zones of seasonal and permanent water saturation, depth to bedrock, USDA/NRCS
soil texture, USDA/NRCS soil structural features of note, slope, compaction and
depth, soil coloration, depth of soil mottling, permeability range, and other
limiting soil characteristics that may reduce permeability.
   E.   County Review. The County reserves the right to review site soil
characteristics with assistance from a certified NRCS soil classifier. In the
process, the County reserves the right to witness any such tests. If
conflicting soils investigation is provided about a given site, a certified
NRCS soil classifier will be requested to provide professional information.
   F.   Site Evaluation. On-site sewage disposal systems may be utilized where
lots or parcels are in compliance with the applicable County Ordinances in
effect on the date of permit application and all of the criteria for site
consideration in Table I (See Appendix B) are satisfied.
   G.   Minimum Depth to Limiting Layer. In no case shall the depth to any
limiting layer be less than 12 inches from the natural soil surface (see next
paragraph). Providing this can be met, the separation below the bottom surface
of the soil absorption system and the top of any limiting layer (i.e. seasonal
groundwater, impermeable strata, bedrock, etc.) shall be as follows:
      1.   Rapidly Permeable Soils. Soils having rapid to very rapid
permeability (> 6.0 in./hr.) shall have at least 4 feet of separation (or as
allowed in Table I).
      2.   Moderately Rapid Soils. Soils having a permeability rate between 2
in./hr. and 6.0 in./hr. shall have at least 3 feet of separation (or as allowed
in Table I).
      3.   Moderate Soils. Soils having a permeability rate slower than 2 in./
hr. shall have at least 2 feet of separation (or as allowed in Table I).
      4.   Creviced Limestone Formations. A subsurface seepage system shall not
be constructed in an area where there is less than 4 feet of soil between the
lowest point in a subsurface seepage system and the top of a creviced limestone
formation. In areas where creviced limestone is known to occur, a soil boring
to a depth of at least 4 feet below the bottom of the subsurface seepage system
shall be made to verify that creviced limestone is not present.
   H.   Setbacks. All setbacks and horizontal distances in Table IV shall be
satisfied.
   I.   Surface Water Overflow. The site of the installation shall not be
subject to saturation from surface water overflow from natural or artificial
drainage of ground surfaces, driveways, roads or roof drains.
   J.   Flood Hazard Area. The land elevation at the site of the proposed
system installation shall not be subject to flooding, (i.e. shall not be within
the 100 year flood hazard area as defined by the base flood elevation of the
closest stream or body of water). Such elevation shall be provided in USGS/MSL
(United States Geological Survey Mean Sea Level) datum.
   K.   Future Replacement Area – Non Residential Properties. In all cases
where non-residential properties are proposed for development, an area for a
full-size replacement system shall be provided. The area shall be suitable for
septic installation as confirmed by onsite soil investigation and designated
for future septic system replacement. This replacement area shall be kept free
of development, traffic or soil modification on all properties.
   L.   Slope Restrictions. Private sewage disposal systems shall not be
permitted on slopes exceeding 25 % (reference Table I on slope limitation).
   M.   Septic Suitability on New Land Parcels. Parcels of less than 10 acres
created on or after September 1, 1990 will be required to demonstrate (via on-
site soils evaluation procedures) one-half acre of contiguous, non-critical
soils within the boundaries of the parcel(s), or designated subsurface seepage
and future replacement subsurface seepage areas in compliance with §
8.04.650 Platting of New Subdivisions, before a permit will be issued for
installation of a septic system. The septic system must be installed within an
area of non-critical soils, or the designated subsurface seepage area. This is
to ensure that all new parcels being created are being developed in a manner
that is consistent with §
8.04.650. On all lots within a subdivision recorded after the date of February
1, 2003, the 1/2 acre of contiguous, non-critical soils, or the designated
subsurface seepage area on each lot shall not be altered or modified until a
septic system permit has been issued.
   N.   Water Table Monitoring Wells. Water table monitoring may be utilized
when the property owner feels that the results of the soil test conducted do
not accurately reflect present day seasonal water tables. The following
requirements will be used when a request is made to use observed water tables
in lieu of soil borings. Please Note: Monitoring in itself does not ensure
approval to install a soil absorption system. Once monitoring is completed, a
request for a variance from the use of soil mottling as an indicator of high
groundwater or seasonal saturation must be made in writing to the Public Health
Administrator.
      1.   Installation Approval. Written approval will be given by the
Department after all the required data listed below has been received and
reviewed. Construction of monitoring wells shall not start until this approval
has been received.
      2.   Soil Boring Logs. Detailed soil boring logs of the area to be
monitored are to be submitted with the proposal.
      3.   Number of Monitoring Wells. No less than two (2) monitoring wells
shall be present in the area of the proposed private sewage disposal system.
One (1) of the monitoring wells shall be located in the lowest portion of the
proposed subsurface seepage area. Monitoring wells shall be present to
accurately portray seasonal groundwater conditions.
      4.   Location and Design. The location and design of the monitoring wells
shall be drawn to scale on a plot sheet. The design shall be based upon
Illustration 3 (Appendix C.), or other design as approved by the Department.
      5.   Monitoring Data Format. The monitoring data shall be recorded by a
licensed professional engineer or soil classifier.
      6.   Monitoring Period. The wells will be required to be monitored for a
period of one (1) year with precipitation amounts of plus or minus 15% of the
average. Rainfall during the Spring season (March 21 to June 21) must be equal
to or greater than the normal amount for that period. The precipitation amounts
will be taken from the closest reporting weather station.
      7.   Monitoring Frequency. The observations shall be made within two (2)
weeks after the frost is absent and thereafter every seven (7) days until July
1st until the test year is complete, the frequency shall be once a month.
However, if there is a heavy rainfall (1/2 inch or more within a 24 hour
period) the monitoring well shall be checked within 24 hours.
      8.   Monthly Precipitation Totals. Precipitation totals are to be
recorded daily and reported with monitoring well levels monthly.
      9.   Site Approval. If no two (2) consecutive observations show the
presence of water above the critical depth, the site will be considered
acceptable.

§ 8.04.430 SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Design of Soil Absorption System. The construction of any private
sewage disposal system requiring soil for ultimate treatment, shall conform to
the requirements herein established. The septic system design shall be prepared
by a professional designer meeting the qualifications of §
8.04.370 Q experienced in the field of on-site private sewage disposal system
design. The system shall be designed to receive all domestic sewage from the
structure proposed to be served. Plans and specifications shall be in accord
with the requirements in §
8.04.370 P of this Ordinance.
   B.   Basis of Design. Septic system sizing is determined by the most
restrictive soil boring in the area of the seepage field. (See Table I,
Appendix B). When a less permeable soil layer is located less than twenty-four
(24) inches in moderate soils; less than thirty-six (36) inches in moderately
rapid soils; or less than forty-eight (48) inches in rapid soils; from the
bottom of the subsurface seepage system; the seepage system shall be sized at
the more limiting permeability. The Department will allow split sizing based
upon the most restrictive of two (2) soil borings which delineate that portion
of the seepage field.
   C.   Soil Absorption System Sizing. The minimum design for a private sewage
disposal system serving any structure, building or group of buildings, shall be
based on the permeability range in inches per hour from Table I (See Appendix
B). This shall be used to determine the maximum sewage loading rate (gallons
per square foot per day) for establishing bottom soil absorption area (square
feet). When the sewage flow exceeds 1500 gal./day, and there is to be a surface
discharge system, then approval shall be obtained from the IEPA. Residential
designs shall be based upon square footage per bedroom.
   D.   Metered Water Use Data. The Department will consider, for other than
residential properties, metered water use data in lieu of the estimated sewage
flow set forth in Table II (See Appendix B). For metered flow considerations,
the applicant shall provide authenticated monthly water use data, documenting
water consumption for the most recent 12 month period for at least three (3)
other establishments of like size operations engaged in the same type
geographic environment, and which have approximately the same operating hours.
   E.   Location and Installation. The private sewage disposal system shall be
located in the same area where the soil investigation was conducted for which
the system design was approved. All private sewage disposal systems shall be
located and installed so that with proper maintenance, the system functions in
a sanitary manner, does not create sanitary nuisances or health hazards and
does not endanger the safety of any domestic water supply. Sewage waste and
effluent from individual on-site private sewage disposal systems shall not be
discharged onto the ground surface or into ditches, drainage structures,
surface waters, or aquifers. The minimum distances between components of
private sewage disposal systems and water supplies, bodies of water, dwellings,
property line and field drain tile listed in Table IV (See Appendix B) shall be
observed.
   F.   Artificial Drains. (Curtain drains, vertical drains or underdrains).
The following high water table conditions may be capable of being altered when
all of the following conditions can be satisfied:
      1.   Shallow, perched water table but not confined under pressure.
      2.   Water table conditions are caused by laterally flowing groundwater.
      3.   Groundwater table is in granular or coarse textured soils. High
groundwater table conditions existing in level sites within soils which are
saturated for periods of time are considered as being incapable of effective
draining by these methods.
   G.   Proposals to Lower Groundwater Table Levels. For any proposal for the
use of these methods of attempting to lower existing groundwater table levels,
hydraulic calculations shall be submitted. The proposal shall be acceptable
provided that the hydraulic calculations support the ability of the drainage
system to lower the existing groundwater table levels and the drainage system
will meet the required setbacks outlined in Table IV. (See Appendix B).
   H.   Monitoring Wells. A network of observation wells shall be installed on
the site and periodic groundwater levels shall be recorded for at least one
year subsequent to installation of the artificial drainage system (See §
8.04.430 F in accordance with §
8.04.420 N (Water Table Monitoring Wells).
   I.   Discharge from Drainage System. Any proposed drainage system shall have
an acceptable gravity outfall which shall not produce surface water or
groundwater problems or nuisances. Discharge to roadside drainage ditches is
not permitted without written permission from the responsible highway
organization or entity.
   J.   Installation in Existing Fill Material (sites filled at the time of the
adoption date of this Ordinance). Filled sites must be evaluated by means of
soil pits for their ability to meet the requirements of §
8.04.420 G and Table I. (See Appendix B.)
   K.   Sizing in Existing Fill Material. The existing fill material shall meet
the requirements of §
8.04.420 G and Table I. Due to the unpredictability of fill material, all
onsite domestic wastewater systems installed in existing fill material, twelve
(12) inches or greater in depth, shall be sized at the largest sizing category
in Table I. In addition, the sewage effluent shall be distributed by low
pressure pipe distribution.
   L.   Installation of Septic Systems Which Require Fill. Whenever a private
sewage disposal system design incorporates the addition of fill, the designer
shall provide a written assessment of the impact of the fill on the retention
or drainage of surface waters on the subject and adjacent properties.
   M.   Site Preparation. Any preparation of the soil absorption area shall be
conducted only when the soil is dry. Site preparation shall be conducted under
the supervision of the licensed private sewage disposal system installation
contractor as established in this Section. All sites shall be mowed and cleared
of brush. Sites approved for private sewage disposal system types 3, 4 and 5
(See §
8.04.470 - §
8.04.490 and Illustration 1) shall be plowed prior to the placement of fill or
gravel as follows:
      1.   Equipment. Equipment shall be a chiselplow.
      2.   Plowing. Plowing shall be done parallel to the site contour.
      3.   Tillage. Tillage shall be minimal to break the consistency of the
sod; maximum depth of tilling shall be eight inches. After tilling, the site
shall not be graded or smoothed.
   N.   Fill Placement. The placement of fill material for private sewage
disposal system types 3, 4 and 5 shall be as established in this section. Fill
shall be approved coarse graded sand (FA1, FA2, FA3) except in the type 4 at-
grade system where only gravel is required, but is handled and placed in the
same manner as fill; or porous earth fill (as defined) with certification from
a soil classifier; and except that the top four (4) inches shall be top soil
for the restoration of vegetation. The fill shall be placed according to the
approved plan and shall be placed immediately after site preparation. The
storage and transportation of fill shall be as specified on the approved plan;
no traffic shall be allowed directly on the plowed area.
   O.   Method of Fill Placement. Fill shall be placed only from the upslope or
ends of the proposed soil absorption area as follows:
   P.   Using Backhoe. Material may be placed with a backhoe reaching into the
soil absorption area.
   Q.   Using Low Compaction Equipment. Material may be pushed into the soil
absorption area by low compression equipment maintaining a minimum of ten (10)
inches of material beneath the equipment.
   R.   Installation in Fine Textured Soils. To prevent soil smearing and
excessive compaction, seepage fields shall not be installed within forty eight
(48) hours of 1/2 inch or greater rainfall. Seepage fields which are partially
or wholly above grade shall not be installed when there is any frost in the
ground. Seepage fields which are wholly into grade shall not be installed when
there is six (6) inches or more of frost in the ground. It is the
responsibility of the private sewage disposal system installation contractor to
evaluate site conditions and assure that the installation will not result in
smearing of soils or excessive soil compaction.
   S.   Replacement Systems. There shall be no limit on the number of
additional conventional private sewage disposal systems installed as
replacements for existing systems.
(Ord. O-201711-51-031, passed 11-14-2017)

forcemain easements shall be designated and provisions for protecting the
forcemain or building sewer (i.e. sleeving) shall be specified.
   I.   Designated Septic System Areas To Serve More Than One Property. Septic
systems serving more than one property shall be on common property under joint
ownership of the users, or under public jurisdiction, or managed by a district
established for the maintenance of such systems.
   J.   Documentation. Documentation shall be provided to the Department that
there will be adequate revenues to maintain and operate the private sewage
disposal system in compliance with Ordinance standards.
(Ord. O-201711-51-031, passed 11-14-2017)
§ 8.04.680 SITES UTILIZING IEPA PERMITTED TECHNOLOGY.
   Within the unincorporated areas of the county, sites utilizing IEPA
permitted technologies shall provide for the following:
   A.   The treatment system serving the subdivision shall be on common
property under the joint ownership of the users, or under public jurisdiction
or managed by a district established for the maintenance of such systems.
   B.   Documentation shall be provided to the Department that the treatment
facility will be operated by individuals who are properly licensed.
   C.   Documentation shall be provided to the Department that there will be
perpetual funding to maintain, operate and replace the wastewater treatment
facility and associated infrastructure within applicable standards.
(Ord. O-201711-51-031, passed 11-14-2017)
§ 8.04.690 OTHER SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Slope Restriction. No area which exceeds the maximum allowable slope
per Table I, shall be included in the ½ acre of suitable soils or the
designated septic system and future replacement areas.
   B.   Required Setbacks. The ½ acre of non-critical soils and the designated
septic system and future replacement areas shall be exclusive of all areas
which fall within the setback distances listed in Table IV.
   C.   Stormwater Drywells. There shall be a 200 foot well restriction from
all existing and proposed stormwater drywells (Class V injection wells) shown
on the tentative and final plats.
   D.   Small Lot Size. Where ½ acre and smaller lot size dictates, designated
locations of wells and septic systems shall be shown on the lots (on the final
plat) to eliminate future conflicts between wells and septic systems.
   E.   Easements. The ½ acre of non-critical soils, and areas designated for
private sewage disposal systems and replacement septic systems, are exclusive
of all easements (i.e. drainage, road construction, utility, landscape, etc.).
   F.   Flood Hazard. Land designated as Flood Hazard is not acceptable for the
installation of a septic system and cannot be included as part of the ½ acre of
non-critical soils, or the designated septic system and future replacement
areas. All areas within the subdivision which are located within the Flood
Hazard area shall be designated on the final plat.
   G.   Dimensions. All dimensions, linear, curvilinear, and angular, necessary
to properly re-survey, shall be shown, with linear dimensions in feet and
decimals of a foot.
   H.   Scale Of Plats. Tentative and Final Plats shall be drawn at a scale of
1 inch to 100 feet or larger.
   I.   Community Sewer And Water. Documentation shall be provided to the
Department that community water and sewer are not available and accessible to
the property.
   J.   Cutting/Filling Of Soils. All areas of filling and/or cutting must be
clearly delineated on an engineering plan. It should be known that this may
influence septic suitability and additional soil work may be required.
   K.   The use of fill and/or cutting of soils is strongly discouraged and
usually results in at least as critical if not more critical soil limitations
for onsite domestic wastewater systems. The primary controlling factor to be
considered is that the natural soils must be unencumbered by a limiting layer
within 30 inches of the natural soil surface. Fill can only be used if that
criterion is met. In this event, fill would have to be limited to carefully
controlled situations, accompanied by detailed engineering. The lower portion,
if not all of the sewage disposal system, must be a minimum of six inches into
natural (undisturbed), uncompacted soils and no deeper than thirty-six (36)
inches from a final grade. At the time, the separation below the trench bottom
to the top of the limiting layer shall be maintained as required in Table I.
   L.   Made Land. Removal of native soils and replacement with suitable soils
shall be considered a “made land” situation, and is not usually acceptable for
on-site, domestic wastewater disposal purposes. Any such consideration of this
approach should be only after consultation with Department personnel prior to
preparing any plans. In addition to the normal soils evaluation in areas of
made lands, the following factors will also influence soil suitability: length
of time fill has been in place; degree of compaction; stratification of soil
texture; re-establishment of soil structure and depth; predictable extent of
materials; and integrity of the fill/natural soil interface.
   M.   Artificial Drains. Use of artificial drains to lower seasonal high
groundwater tables shall be in compliance with §
8.04.430 F.
   N.   Hydrogeological Assessment. The proposal shall comply with §
8.04.610 of this Ordinance. When rapid or very rapid permeable soils are
present in the top thirty six (36) inches of a proposed subdivision utilizing
subsurface domestic wastewater disposal, a hydrogeological investigation report
will be required. This report shall be completed by a licensed professional
geologist and contain, at a minimum, the following information:
      1.   An evaluation as to the availability of sufficient quantity of water
to serve the proposed subdivision; and
      2.   Shallow groundwater depth(s) and flow direction(s) at the proposed
subdivision.
      3.   An evaluation of upgradient negative groundwater influences on the
proposed subdivision. Potential influences for consideration shall include but
not be limited to known groundwater contamination sites and upgradient land
uses which may impact groundwater quality;
      4.   An evaluation of downgradient negative groundwater influences by the
proposed subdivision. The cumulative impact of chlorides, nitrates, phosphates
and bacteria on groundwater, and any downgradient sensitive environments (i.e.
surface water, wetlands, fens, etc.) shall be evaluated at a minimum, and
      5.   Recommended actions to minimize impact of upgradient groundwater on
the subdivision or the subdivision's impact on downgradient groundwater.

NOTES CORRESPONDING TO TABLE 1
1. Required separation is measured from the bottom of trench in a type 1, 2 or 3 system, bottom of
aggregate in type 4 system or bottom of sand fill in a type 5 system. When a less permeable soil layer is
located less than 24 inches in moderate soils, less than 36 inches in moderately rapid soils, or less than
48 inches in rapid soils, from the bottom of trench aggregate or sand fill; the seepage system shall be
sized at the more limiting permeability.
2. Not suitable fix development. A variance will be considered when demonstrated that treatment will
reduce the groundwater Nitrate levels to less than ten (10) milligrams per liter leaving the property, or
the density of domestic wastewater disposal is less than or equal to 1 per 1.5 acres, and the effluent
meets the requirements of NSF standard 40.
3. The required separation from bottom of trench or aggregate to the seasonal high groundwater can be
reduced to eighteen (18) inches in moderate soils: a) when a type 4 system is used, and when the limiting
layer is 18-23 inches from the natural soils surface and/or b) when LPP distribution is utilized and
seasonal high groundwater is twenty four (24) inches or greater from the natural soil surface. Refer to
columns 1 and 3 in Table 1.
4. The required separation from bottom of aggregate or sand fill to the seasonal high groundwater can be
reduced to twenty four (24) inches when a type 4 or type 5 system is used, and when the seasonal high
groundwater is 24-53 inches from the natural soil surface and with treatment capacity to reduce
groundwater Nitrate levels to less than ten (10) milligrams per liter leaving the property.
5. Systems must be pressurized utilizing duplex pumps alternating to each half of the seepage field or low
pressure pipe distribution as specified in section 2000.

TABLE VIII: VARIANCES POSSIBLE FOR SEPTIC SYSTEMS TO SERVE NEW CONSTRUCTION.
Note: When circumstances exist which make impractical full compliance with the
requirements of the Ordinance, an applicant may request a variance. Each
variance request is reviewed in conjunction with the specific on-site
conditions. It should not be assumed that a variance will automatically be
granted. The following table provides general guidelines for variances which
may be considered for private sewage disposal systems for new construction:

   A.   Dangerous Dog Determination:
      1.   The Administrator or his or her authorized agent may initiate a
dangerous dog investigation to determine whether a dog is dangerous. A dog may
be deemed dangerous if it is:
         a.   any individual dog anywhere other than upon the property of the
owner or custodian of the dog and un-muzzled, unleashed, or unattended by its
owner or custodian that behaves in a manner that a reasonable person would
believe poses a serious and unjustified imminent threat of serious physical
injury or death to a person or companion animal; or
         b.   a dog that, without justification, bites a person and does not
cause serious physical injury.
      2.   No dog shall be deemed a "dangerous dog" unless shown to be a
dangerous dog by a preponderance of the evidence. In order to have a dog deemed
dangerous, the Administrator, or his or her authorized agent, must:

unless under control by leash or other recognized physical control method;
         c.   Afford the owner an opportunity to meet with the Administrator
prior to the making of a determination that a dog is deemed dangerous;
         d.   Conduct a thorough investigation, in which he or she may gather
any medical or veterinary evidence and interview witnesses. The owner of a dog
under investigation or the Department may provide testimony of a certified
applied behaviorist, a board certified veterinary behaviorist, or other
recognized expert who may be relevant to the determination of whether the dog's
behavior was justified pursuant to the provisions of this Section;
         e.   Make a detailed written report, which shall be referred to as the
Administrator's Decision and Order, recommending a finding whether or not the
dog be deemed dangerous; and

by the Administrator; including a complete description of the appeal process;
and including orders to the owner of the dangerous dog as to any penalties, and
dangerous dog fees to be paid.

Administrator, or his or her authorized agent, determines the conduct of the
dog was justified because either:

a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog or was committing a
willful trespass or other tort upon the premises or property occupied by the
owner of the animal;
      2.   The threatened person was tormenting, abusing, assaulting, or
physically threatening the dog or its offspring;
      3.   The injured, threatened, or killed companion animal was attacking or

its owner, custodian, or a member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
   C.   Dangerous Dog Restrictions:
      1.   If deemed dangerous, the Administrator, or his or her authorized
agent, shall order the dog to be spayed or neutered within fourteen (14) days
at the owner's expense and microchipped, if not already, and one or more of the
following as deemed appropriate under the circumstances and necessary for the
protection of the public:
         a.   Evaluation of the dog by a certified applied behaviorist, a board

under control by leash or other recognized physical control method;
         e.   Prohibit the owner or keeper of a dangerous dog from selling or
giving away the dog, without providing notification, including the new owner's
name and address, to the Administrator. Whenever an owner of a dangerous dog
relocates, he or she shall notify both the Administrator and McHenry County
Animal Control where he or she has relocated within five (5) days of change of
address.
      2.   Failure by the owner to do as ordered by the Administrator and as
outlined in this Ordinance is a violation of this Ordinance and the

Control shall impound the dog and the owner shall pay all impoundment fees to

determination. The proceeding shall be conducted as a civil hearing pursuant to
the Illinois Rules of Evidence and the Code of Civil Procedure, including the
discovery provisions. After hearing both parties' evidence, the court may make

Facility or expansion of an existing Pollution Control Facility in
unincorporated McHenry County, an applicant must file one (1) original and

written comment if submitted in person, or the postmark if the written comment

(Ord. O-200605-32-054, passed 5-16-2006)
§ 9.12.050 FALSE ALARMS AND ALARM USER CESSATION.
   A.   Except where an alarm would not be considered a false alarm pursuant to
§
9.12.020 7.a., if the McHenry County Sheriff responds to more than three false
alarms in a calendar year, the Alarm User or agency shall be guilty of a petty
offense and shall pay a fine to the County within 30 days of receipt of notice
of such offense in the sum(s) found in
Appendix A. Failure to pay the fine (within said 30 days) shall result in
prosecution for violating this ordinance and upon conviction the fine shall be
not less than $150.00 nor more than $1000.00. The fine payable upon receipt of
notice and prior to any prosecution shall be paid to the County of McHenry and
delivered to the McHenry County Circuit Clerk.
   B.   Except where an alarm would not be considered a false alarm pursuant to
§
9.12.020 7.a., the Alarm User or agency shall be guilty of a petty offense for
each false fire alarm after the third false fire alarm reported to the McHenry
County Sheriffs Department by a fire protection district or rescue squad in a
calendar year. The alarm user or agency shall pay a fine to the County within
30 days of receipt of notice of such offense in the sum(s) found in
Appendix A. Failure to pay the fine (within said 30 days) shall result in
prosecution for violating this ordinance and upon conviction the fine shall be
not less than $150.00 nor more than $1000.00. The fine payable upon receipt of
notice and prior to any prosecution shall be paid to the County of McHenry and
delivered to the McHenry County Circuit Clerk.
   C.   If the McHenry County Sheriffs Department responds to a false alarm and
it is determined that the cause of false alarm was the negligence of the Alarm
Business for failing to contact the SHERIFF’S PSAP of work being done on the
alarm, the Alarm Business shall be guilty of a petty offense and shall pay a
fine to the County within 30 days of receipt of notice of such offense in the
sum(s) found in
Appendix A. Failure to pay the fine shall result in prosecution for violating
this ordinance and upon conviction the fine shall be not less than $150.00 nor
more than $1000.00. The fine payable upon receipt of notice and prior to any
prosecution shall be paid to the County of McHenry and delivered to the McHenry
County Circuit Clerk.
   D.   After 20 false alarms, the Alarm Administrator may request to the alarm
user that the alarm system be removed or disengaged. If the alarm user refuses
to remove or disengage the alarm after such request, the Sheriffs Department
will no longer respond to the alarm until such time as documentation is
presented that satisfies the Alarm Administrator that the problem has been
rectified. Should the Alarm Administrator determine that the nature of the
Alarm User’s or agency’s business or the complexity of the alarm system caused
continued false alarms which are not the result of any substantial negligence
or disregard on the part of the Alarm User or agency, the Alarm Administrator
may permit the Alarm User or agency to retain the registration without
requesting the removal or disengagement of the alarm system. If the alarm user
is not requested to remove or disengage their alarm, each subsequent false
alarm will result in the Alarm User or agency paying a fine to the County
within 30 days of receipt of a notice of such offense in the sum(s) found in
Appendix A. Failure to pay the fine shall result in prosecution for violating
this ordinance and upon conviction the fine shall be not less than $150.00 nor
more than $1000.00. The fine payable upon receipt of notice and prior to any
prosecution shall be paid to the County of McHenry and delivered to the McHenry
County Sheriff Department. Failure to remove or disengage an alarm system at
the request of the Alarm Administrator may result in the McHenry County
Sheriffs Department’s refusal to respond to alarms from the Alarm User or
Agency, with or without notice to the Alarm User or Agency of such decision.

(Ord. O-200605-32-054, passed 5-16-2006)

9.12.040 or the existence of this false alarm ordinance is not intended to, nor

response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the
failure to respond to an alarm is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity
as provided by law is retained.

levels and prior response history.

9.12.050D. of this ordinance is not intended to, nor will it, create a

consequential damage resulting from the removal or disengagement of an alarm
pursuant to a request by the Alarm Administrator is hereby disclaimed and

that a word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or other provision
is invalid or that the application of any part of the provision to any Person

those provisions to other Persons or circumstances are not affected by that

ARTICLE I. OVERVIEW
§ 10.12.010 TITLE.
   This Ordinance shall be known as, and may be referred to as the “McHenry
County Access Control and Right-of-Way Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.020 PURPOSE.
   A.   The proper management and operation of the County Highway’s
infrastructure is critical to the safety of the motoring public and directly
related to the overall economic health and quality of life of McHenry County.
The economic vitality of the County is also related to the availability of
access to the arterial highway system. This requires the implementation of
access management regulations that provide for a balance between the need to
move traffic safely and efficiently while still providing access to adjacent
properties.
   B.   The construction, maintenance and improvement of the County Highway
System represent a substantial investment of public funds, impacts from
development on the County Highway System shall be mitigated by development and
shall not result in the need for the investment of additional public funds. The
use of the County Highway System’s rights-of-way by non-highway uses must be
properly managed to ensure that these non-highway uses do not constrain the
ability of the County to improve the County Highway System in the future.
   C.   Therefore, this Ordinance is adopted for the following purposes:
      1.   To protect, provide and promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the motoring public utilizing County Highways.
      2.   To minimize congestion and delay on County Highways which results
from providing access to abutting property.
      3.   To maintain an acceptable Level-of- Service on County Highways.
      4.   To minimize conflicts between vehicles traveling along the County
Highway and vehicles entering and exiting County Highways via private or public
access facilities.
      5.   To provide for the proper location and spacing of access facilities,
to limit the number of access facilities to abutting properties, to minimize
interference with the flow of traffic on the County Highway, and to minimize
interference with traffic using adjacent access facilities.
      6.   To allow the County Engineer to establish reasonable standards and

from the McHenry County Division of Transportation shall be given in writing,
via certified mail, and shall allow the person or party responsible a minimum
of thirty (30) calendar days, from receipt of notice, to perform said removal.
Removal, as defined in this Ordinance, shall include restoration of the County
Highway right-of-way to a like or better condition than existed prior to the
illegal placement.

(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
ARTICLE IV. GENERAL ACCESS REQUIREMENTS
§ 10.12.190 GENERAL.
   A.   The location and overall control of access points, whether full or
restricted, is necessary to provide efficient, productive and safe highway
operations for motorists using highway facilities. The use of frontage roads,
joint access and interconnection to other adjacent properties, whether existing
or proposed, or indirect access to the County Highway System via other existing
or proposed roads, whether State, County, Township or municipal roads, may be
required and be used as the sole means of access to a property. In all cases,
the operational characteristics of the new access point must meet traffic
engineering criteria for safe traffic operations as required by this Ordinance.
In many cases, roadway improvements including, but not limited to turning
lanes, medians, turning restrictions, traffic signals, and roadway lighting may
be required and shall be funded and constructed by the permittee in order to
ensure safe traffic operations and visibility.
   B.   An access permit issued by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation shall be required for the construction of any new access
facility and any related improvements required by this Ordinance, including,
but not limited to, widened pavements for additional lanes, shoulders, ditches,
storm drainage facilities, or the modification or replacement of any existing
access facility within the right-of-way of a County Highway when the work is
being performed by any person, developer, contractor, or public agency other
than McHenry County.
   C.   Any access and associated highway improvements shall be constructed by,
and at the sole cost of the property owner(s) or developer(s) and at no cost to
McHenry County or the McHenry County Division of Transportation.
   D.   An access permit shall also be required when a change in use of the
access facility or change in the land-use or land-use density occurs and the
continued use of an existing access is proposed. Changes in land-use or land-
use density may result in a change in the number of vehicles using an access
facility. Therefore, modifications, improvements, additional right-of-way
dedications or revisions may be required to the access facility and/or the
County Highway to accommodate the change in traffic.
COMMENTARY: Redevelopment of an existing gas station to include a convenience
store and car wash is an example of a change in land-use density and use.
Expansion of a commercial building to include additional stores, or offices
above is another example of a change in land-use density.
   E.   An access permit shall not be required for a public agency when an
intergovernmental agreement covers the work involved therein or at such times
as the County Engineer is exercising statutory supervisory authority.
   F.   Ancillary facilities such as utilities, traffic signals, sidewalks,
multi-use paths, lighting, etc. that may accompany a private development and
that may be requested to be placed within a County Highway right-of-way shall
be permitted, if the placement of said facilities in the right-of-way is
acceptable to the McHenry County Division of Transportation, separately from
the access. Articles V and VI of this Ordinance contain the permit requirements
for utilities, facilities, and other types of permits.
   G.   Requirements for access to a County Highway are based on two factors:
      1.   The Classification of the County Highway from which the access is
being permitted
      2.   The type of access (Major, Minor, Temporary, Emergency)
   H.   The party requesting access must specify the type of access being
requested. If the access type is unknown or ambiguous, the party requesting
access shall consult the McHenry County Division of Transportation. The County
Engineer has the responsibility and final authority for determining the access
type.
   I.   To assist a property owner, developer, their engineer, contractor,
public agencies or any other applicant in the administrative, procedural and
engineering requirements of this Ordinance, please refer to the Permit
Procedures and Requirements Manual.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.200 HIGHWAY CLASSIFICATION FOR ACCESS MANAGEMENT.
   605 ILCS 5/5-102 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended, describes
County Highways as those highways that “shall be as nearly as possible highways
connecting the principal municipalities and trading points in each county with
each other, and also with the principal municipalities and trading points in
other counties.” By their definition, the primary function of County Highways
is to provide a high degree of mobility.
COMMENTARY: Most highway design, administrative, and regulatory policies vary
depending on the function a highway provides. This functional classification is
based on mobility (the degree to which traffic can move easily and the volume
of traffic moved) and accessibility (the ease of entering/exiting adjacent
property). Functional classification ranges from freeways (high mobility, low
accessibility) to local streets (low mobility, high accessibility.) Studies
have shown that an effective access management program can reduce crashes by as
much as 50%, increase roadway capacity by 23% to 45% and reduce travel time and
delay as much as 40% to 60% (source: Access Management Manual, Transportation
Research Board, 2003.) Therefore, the appropriate degree of access control
varies according to the function the roadway provides.
   A.   Highway Classification Definitions. The County Highway System is
comprised of roadways with varying functional classification. For purposes of
determining the requirements and procedures for permitting of access
facilities, the following Highway Classifications for Access Management are
established:
      DESIGNATED FREEWAY: Those roadways that, in accordance with 605 5/8-101
of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended, have been designated by the
County Board as freeways and as such, are intended to provide the highest level
of mobility within the County Highway System. They are intended to provide very
low accessibility.
      PRINCIPAL ARTERIALS: Those County Highways that by their length and
connectivity with other county and/or state highways, within or adjacent to
McHenry County, provide for a high degree of mobility and supplement the
mobility of State Highways and freeways.
      ARTERIALS: Those County Highways that provide connectivity between the
municipal street system and other County or State Highways or serve as a
connection between County Highways.
      OTHER: Those roadways within the County Highway System whose functional
classification is below an arterial or by their current physical
characteristics provides a low level of mobility.
   B.   Access Management Highway Classification Map.
      1.   Adoption of Map. To implement the intent of this Chapter, the County
Highway System is hereby divided into Highway Classifications for Access
Management as depicted on the Access Management Highway Classification Map
which, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.
      2.   Map Amendments.
         a.   As County Highways are constructed, improved, reconstructed or
otherwise altered, there may be a need to change the classification of a County
Highway for access management purposes. The Access Management Highway
Classification Map may be amended from time to time by the County Board in
accordance with §
10.12.180A. of this Ordinance.
         b.   The McHenry County Division of Transportation shall be
responsible for maintaining and updating the Access Management Highway
Classification Map pursuant to all amendments enacted by the County Board.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.210 ACCESS POLICIES.
   A.   Any owner of property abutting a County Highway has the right of
reasonable access. Indirect access via other existing or proposed streets or
easements, or restricted access is considered reasonable access to a County
Highway. The following policies shall be applied to all types of access.
   B.   To assist a property owner, developer, their engineer, contractor,
public agencies or any other applicant in the administrative, procedural and
engineering requirements of this Ordinance, please refer to the Permit
Procedures and Requirements Manual.
      1.   Access Criteria. The criteria presented include the number of access
facilities, their location with respect to adjacent access facilities and
public streets.
         a.   Number of Access Points.
            (1)   Each development or property, regardless of the number of
parcels, shall be limited to one full access point except as provided for
otherwise in this Ordinance. For County Highways that are not designated as
Freeways, one additional access point may be granted if it can be demonstrated
that the Level-of-Service at the approved (initial) access point would be
improved by a minimum of one letter grade of Level-of-Service and a minimum
spacing requirement of one-quarter mile between full access points can be met.
A Level-of-Service improvement above, a Level-of-Service “C” shall not warrant
additional access points, whether full or restricted. If the approved initial
access point is to be signalized, then no additional full access points shall
be permitted.
            (2)   The McHenry County Division of Transportation may permit one
additional restricted access point permitting right-turns in and right-turns
out only, provided that the permittee clearly demonstrates a substantial need
and complies with all the applicable provisions of this Ordinance. This option
will only be considered where the enforcement of this restricted movement will
be possible.
   COMMENTARY: Where additional access points are requested to a County
Highway, first consideration shall be given to supplemental access points,
which restrict turning movements. Shared access points or indirect access from
adjacent public streets is encouraged, and in some cases may be required
instead of direct access and/or additional access points to a County Highway.
         b.   Existing Frontage on Multiple County Highways. When a property or
development has frontage on more than one County Highway, access may be
restricted to the County Highway having the lower Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
volume based on McHenry County Division of Transportation ADT maps or recent
traffic count data reviewed and approved by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation.
         c.   Alignment with Existing Access Locations or Roads.
            (1)   Where an existing access facility or road is on the opposite
side of the County Highway from an abutting property for which access is being
requested, the proposed access point shall be aligned with the existing access
facility or road.
            (2)   If the highway has an existing major access or public road on
the opposite side of the highway from the proposed new major access and a left
turn lane is required on the County Highway for the new major access based on
the requirement of this Ordinance, then a left-turn shall also be constructed
on the County Highway serving the existing major access on the opposite side
regardless of whether the prior, existing major access had a left-turn lane
(refer to the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual for additional
clarifications.)
            (3)   Given site specific characteristics or operational
considerations on the County Highway, the McHenry County Division of
Transportation may waive this requirement if, at a minimum the following
conditions exist:
               (a)   The abutting property for which access is being requested
has insufficient frontage to allow for the proper alignment with the existing
access facility or road.
               (b)   The proposed point of access would not comply with other
provisions and requirements set forth in this Ordinance.
               (c)   The alignment of the proposed access point with an
existing access facility or road would be detrimental to traffic flow, result
in undue delay, impede traffic operations, or impair traffic safety on the
County Highway.
            (4)   In the event that a proposed access point is not aligned as
provided for in this Section, the spacing of access points with existing
adjacent access points and roads shall comply with the provisions of §§
10.12.210B.1.c. and B.1.d.
         d.   Spacing of Adjacent Access Points.
            (1)   To enhance traffic safety and operations on County Highways
and to function effectively, adjacent access shall be spaced to ensure safe and
efficient traffic movements and operations.
            (2)   The minimum distance between adjacent full access points
shall be determined by the distance required to provide full left-turn tapers
and storage bays along the County Highway for inbound turning movements to each
access facility regardless of the present need for said tapers and storage bays
if none currently exist.
            (3)   If a property has inadequate frontage to meet these spacing
requirements, the McHenry County Division of Transportation shall determine the
location of the access point using the standards and provisions established by
the Ordinance. The McHenry County Division of Transportation may require that
the access facility be shared, that indirect access be used, or the access
facility restrict turning movements.
         e.   Distance from Existing Public Streets.
            (1)   To enhance traffic safety and operations on County Highways,
access point shall be located a sufficient distance from intersecting streets.
            (2)   The minimum distance between an access point and an
intersecting street shall be determined by the distance required to provide
full left-turn tapers and storage bays along the County Highway, for inbound
turning movements, for both the access point and the intersecting street,
regardless of the present need for said tapers and storage bays if none
currently exist.
            (3)   If a property has inadequate frontage to meet this distance
requirement, the McHenry County Division of Transportation shall determine the
location of the access point using the standards and provisions established by
the Ordinance. The McHenry County Division of Transportation may require that
the access facility be shared, that indirect access be used, or the access
facility restrict turning movements.
         f.   Proximity to Adjacent Intersections and Access Facilities-
Extension of Improvements.
            (1)   If construction of the required improvements for an access
location, as determined by this Ordinance, requires the widening and
improvements to the abutting County Highway, and an existing intersection or
major access facility falls within the limits of construction, then such
widening or improvements shall extend through and beyond the intersection or
access facility before tapering down to the existing pavement width. Exclusive
left-turn lanes shall be provided at the existing intersection or access
facility. In such instances, the McHenry County Division of Transportation
shall determine the geometries and limits of construction of the widening and
improvement to a County Highway based on traffic flow and traffic safety.
            (2)   If the limits of any required County Highway Improvements for
an access location fall within seven-hundred (700) feet of the start of any
through lane tapers of an existing widened section of a County Highway, then
the required widening for the access improvements shall extend through both the
tapered sections and intervening gap and match into the fully-widened section
of the existing adjacent improvement in order to maintain through lane
alignment and continuity. The 700-foot criteria is defined as the distance from
the start of any existing through lane widening taper to the start of the
proposed through lane widening taper for the required access improvement.
Additional clarification is provided in the Permit Procedures and Requirements
Manual.
         g.   Removal or Modification of Existing Adjacent Access Facilities.
If construction of the proposed access interferes with, or causes the need for
modification of an existing adjacent access point, the permittee may be
required to remove, modify, relocate, or reconstruct said existing adjacent
access in order to provide for the safe and efficient flow of traffic on the
County Highway at the proposed access location. The cost of said modifications,
relocation, or reconstruction shall be the sole responsibility of the
permittee.
      2.   Restricted Turning Movements.
         a.   In certain instances, turning movements may be restricted at an
access location. Conditions under which turning movements may be restricted are
listed below:
            (1)   Where numerous access points exist and the spacing between
them does not permit adequate left-turn tapers and storage bays for inbound
vehicles without blocking adjacent access points.
            (2)   At access points close to an existing intersection where
inbound or outbound left-turns would have to be made within areas where traffic
is queued during any period of the day.
            (3)   Where other conditions, such as limited visibility
(inadequate sight distance) prevent left turns in or left turns out from being
made safely.
            (4)   Where a parcel of land is provided with more than one access
point, such as indirect access or access to an existing adjacent street.
            (5)   Where a parcel of land has access provided by a signalized
access point and an unsignalized access point, left-turns shall be prohibited
at the unsignalized location.
            (6)   When other detrimental capacity, delay, operational, or
safety conditions would result from permitting left-turns into or out of the
access point.
         b.   Turning movement restrictions shall be enforced with barrier
median or driveway channelization. The McHenry County Division of
Transportation shall determine the type of channelization based on site
conditions and the Highway Classification. Design standards and details are
provided in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
      3.   Indirect Access.
         a.   Access to Other Streets. Access to a County Highway may be
prohibited when a property abutting a County Highway has frontage on one or
more other streets and reasonable access can be provided from said streets. The
McHenry County Division of Transportation shall determine, on a site specific
basis, whether access will be permitted to the County Highway if access to
other streets is available.
         b.   Access to Out Lots and Corner Lots. Subdivisions or developments
that result in the platting of out lots or corner lots must provide internal
indirect access to these lots via cross-easements, frontage roads or other
internal roadway system. Direct access to a County Highway from individual out
lots or corner lots of a development shall be prohibited.
      4.   Provisions for Interconnect to Existing or Proposed Developments and
Adjacent Properties.
         a.   New access locations for developments along a County Highway
shall provide easements, roadways, and other means of future indirect access to
allow for future connections to adjacent parcels or developments and to reduce
the use of the County Highway as the sole means of traveling between adjacent
developments or properties.
         b.   As a condition of access to a property or development, provisions
for such easements and construction of the internal roadway system to the
property lines shall be required. No plat of subdivision shall be approved and
signed by the County Engineer unless said subdivision provides adequate
provisions for Interconnection to existing or future adjacent developments and
properties.
   COMMENTARY: Internal connections between developments permit motorists to
move between developments without forcing these trips between subdivisions or
other destinations to overburden the County Highway System which increases
congestion. Such interconnections provide for additional means of access for
emergency responders, maintenance operations or other public agencies during
periods of roadway construction, inclement weather or obstruction of roadways
during emergencies.
      5.   Required Use of Shared Access. Certain geometric, visibility and
site conditions or constraints may require that access between two or more
developments or properties be shared. When individual parcel frontages are of
such limited length that individual access points cannot be constructed and
meet the spacing requirements of this Ordinance (see §§
10.12.210B.1d., B.1.e. and B.1.f.) or adequate visibility (sight distance)
cannot be provided along the frontage of an individual parcel or development,
shared access with adjacent developments or properties may be required.
      6.   Changes in Land-Use or Land-Use Density.
         a.   The property owner or developer shall make application to the
McHenry County Division of Transportation to request continued use of the
existing access. The application shall be reviewed as if a new access is being
permitted and all of the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply.
         b.   If a property is being re-subdivided or redeveloped, the existing
access point(s) may require relocation, reconstruction, or the number of access
points reduced to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.
   COMMENTARY: Some older residential subdivisions were developed on a grid
system with each local street accessing the County Highway. Should these areas
redevelop, some of the existing focal streets may be required to be closed
(cul-de-sac) or be converted to restricted access (such as right-turns in/
right-turns out only.) Older commercial developments often have multiple full
access driveways, such as driveway for each building in a development. Upon
redevelopment, consolidation of access points, or conversion of some of these
access points to restricted access (right-turns in/right-turns out only) will
be required.
      7.   Property Being Subdivided or Developed- Internal Circulation.
         a.   When property abutting a County Highway is to be subdivided or
developed, direct access to a County Highway shall not be the sole means of
access in lieu of an adequate internal traffic circulation system that could
provide access to an existing public street (indirect access) or a County
Highway of lesser volume (see §
10.12.210B.1.b.) Lack of an adequate internal traffic circulation system shall
not be a reason to be granted additional access locations.
         b.   The internal circulation of a development shall not result in
backing or other related turning maneuvers on, or within the County Highway
right-of-way in order to access buildings or loading docks. Parking shall not
be permitted within the County Highway right of way. Provisions for adequate
turnarounds and parking shall be provided outside of the County Highway right-
of-way.
      8.   Required Minimum Offset to Internal Roadways–Designated Freeways and
Principal Arterials.
         a.   Any major access on a Designated Freeway or Principal Arterial
shall have a minimum distance between the centerline of the County Highway and
the centerline of the first continuous driveway or internal roadway of at least
400 feet. Refer to the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual for additional
guidance op this requirement.
      b.   If the minimum 400 feet cannot be accommodated, additional through
lanes and auxiliary turning lanes will be required on the access approach
roadway to accommodate the projected level of queuing on the access as
estimated in the traffic impact study.
      9.   Previously Subdivided Lands. Land subdivided prior to the effective
date of this Ordinance for which access is now being requested, shall comply
with the requirements of this Ordinance to the extent possible. If the access
requirements of this Ordinance cannot be met, a variance, in accordance with
Article VIII of this Ordinance can be requested.
COMMENTARY: The design, or lack thereof, of internal roadways that link various
portions of a development is not reason to request additional full access
locations. For example, the internal traffic circulation of a retail
development should allow traffic to move between buildings, out lots, and
connect to adjacent commercial developments. Residential developments should
not consist of a series of loop roads or cul-de-sacs that require multiple
access, points on the County Highway and should instead loop and connect
neighborhoods internally.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.220 ACCESS PERMITS.
   Written authorization in the form of a permit issued by the McHenry County
Division of Transportation, is required prior to the construction of any new
access facility, modification of any existing access facility or the
construction of any temporary access or the commencement of any construction
activities within the County Highway right-of-way. Permit applications, forms
and other administrative procedures are contained within the Permit Procedures
and Requirements Manual.
   A.   Definition of Access Permit Classifications.
Access to a County Highway shall be granted via one of four (4) types of access
permit classifications. Access Permit classifications are a function of the
traffic volumes that the access will generate and the usage of the access. The
four (4) classifications of permits followed by their definitions are:
      1.   Minor Access Permit
      2.   Major Access Permit
      3.   Temporary Access Permit
      4.   Emergency Access Permit
   B.   Minor Access.
      1.   A Minor Access is one which serves property abutting a County
Highway, has an anticipated ADT volume of no more than fifty (50) trips, as
estimated utilizing the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers trip generation statistics, and has no regular use by vehicles or
vehicle combinations of three axles or more (personal recreational vehicles and
agricultural field equipment excluded.)
COMMENTARY: Land uses that would potentially quality for a Minor Access are
farm entrances, small residential developments (one to four houses), apartment
complex with less than 8 units, or an office building with less than 3,000
square feet df gross area.
      2.   Administrative and processing requirements for Minor Access permits
are contained within the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual
   C.   Major Access. A Major Access is one which serves property abutting a
County Highway and has an anticipated ADT volume of more than fifty (50) trips,
as estimated utilizing the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers trip generation statistics. Major accesses have an impact on the
capacity, use and traffic flow of the adjacent County Highway, Because of these
impacts, all applicants for a Major Access Permit shall meet with the McHenry
County Division of Transportation at the initial planning stages of the
development to discuss location, basic requirements, and future changes or
plans for the County Highway. Detailed permit application requirements and
further guidance are provided in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
All Major Access Permits requests require, at a minimum, submittal of a Traffic
Impact Study (T.I.S.) as defined in §
10.12.260B. of this Ordinance.
COMMENTARY: Land uses that would require a Major Access are residential or
commercial subdivisions, office buildings/complexes, individual businesses such
as restaurants, office or service businesses, institutional or public buildings
such as schools, governmental buildings or churches with larger congregations,
day care, or preschool facilities.
   D.   Temporary Access.
      1.   A Temporary Access is one which serves property abutting a County
Highway and is used for a specified purpose for a short duration of time,
typically less than 12 months, and then is removed in its entirety or is
replaced with either a Major Access or Emergency Access.
   COMMENTARY: Examples of temporary access are temporary access for
construction of on-site utilities, special events, construction access to
backyards, or access, for a construction entrance to begin initial site
preparation work such as mass grading, construction of the internal road system
and installation of main utility lines.
      2.   Temporary Access permits for utility and initial site work on
property that will be served by a Major Access Permit shall be issued at the
discretion of the McHenry County Division of Transportation and only at such
time as a Major Access Permit has been applied for, a Traffic Impact Study and
Preliminary Plat has been previously submitted to the McHenry County Division
of Transportation for review, and the location and extent of improvements
required for the Major Access have been agreed to by the McHenry County
Division of Transportation.
      3.   The Temporary Access shall not be used to access, construct or
occupy any home(s) or building(s) within a development unless specifically
authorized in writing by the McHenry County Division of Transportation. The
Temporary Access shall not be used to access and occupy any home or building
within a development in lieu of the internal access being constructed.
      4.   The permittee shall notify, or require their contractor to notify
the McHenry County Division of Transportation prior to the installation of the
access to provide for scheduling of inspections by the McHenry County Division
of Transportation In accordance with the conditions attached to the permit and
as specified in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
      5.   All temporary access locations shall be removed by the expiration
date indicated on the permit and all disturbed areas of the highway right-of-
way restored to a pre-construction condition or better, unless the temporary
access is replaced with Major Access. An extension of the time period for the
temporary access will be considered by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation upon written request from the permittee.
      6.   The installation and continued maintenance of a Temporary Access
shall be the responsibility of the permittee and shall be installed and
maintained in accordance with the specifications, conditions and requirements
of the McHenry County Division of Transportation as attached to the permit and
as provided in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual. The continued
cleanup of any mud, dirt, aggregate, or other debris that may be tracked out of
a Temporary Access onto the County Highway shall be a condition of approval of
said Temporary Access. Failure to adequately maintain the temporary access and
keep the County Highway pavements free of any mud, dirt, aggregate, or other
debris may result in revocation of the permit and removal of the access as
outlined below.
      7.   Failure by the permittee to remove a permitted Temporary Access
after the expiration date of the permit is a violation of this Ordinance and
may result in the assessment of fines, in accordance with Article III of this
Ordinance, until such time as the access has been removed. If the permittee
should fail to remove the access, the McHenry County Division of Transportation
will facilitate such removal and shall bill the property owner or permittee for
the expense of such removal including fines, administrative and legal costs if
so incurred by the County.
      8.   In the event the McHenry County Division of Transportation
determines that the permittee is using the Temporary Access for purposes, or
for a period of time, not in conformance with this Ordinance or any approved
conditions that were a part of the Temporary Access permit, the McHenry County
Division of Transportation may require the removal of said Temporary Access by
the permittee or have the access removed by County forces and invoice the
permittee for said costs to remove the access and restore the County Highway
right-of-way.
      9.   In the case of residential or commercial developments, the site
development plans and access plans to the County Highway shall include a design
to show the temporary access geometries, location, pavement section and signage
to the standards as set forth by the McHenry County Division of Transportation.
Reference the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual for geometric, pavement
and signage details required for a Temporary Access.
      10.   Prior to the issuance of a Temporary Access Permit the owner shall
provide sufficient financial guarantees and evidence of insurance to safeguard
claims against the County for such work. Depending on the type and magnitude of
the work, the McHenry County Division of Transportation may require both
Performance and Maintenance guarantees. Article IX of this Ordinance defines
the requirements for Performance and Maintenance guarantees.
   E.   Emergency Access.
      1.   The installation of emergency access points on County Highways is
discouraged, in some cases may not be permitted, and should only be used when
providing other means of indirect access are not feasible. An Emergency Access
is one which serves property abutting a County Highway and is used exclusively
by emergency response providers, such as fire and rescue agencies for purposes
of accessing areas of a development in times of emergency or natural disaster
whereby normal street access is blocked.
      2.   Issuance of an Emergency Access permit shall be at the sole
discretion of the McHenry County Division of Transportation and shall be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis taking into account site specifics conditions
and constraints. Written documentation requesting and justifying the Emergency
Access shall be provided by the local emergency agency or local authority
having jurisdiction over the property requesting access and is required as part
of the McHenry County Division of Transportation’s review process.
      3.   Emergency access shall not be provided at a signalized intersection
on a County Highway.
      4.   Emergency access driveways shall be gated with a locking mechanism
and shall be designed to discourage use by unauthorized vehicles and shall be
maintained by parties other than the McHenry County Division of Transportation.
      5.   Signage shall be designed and installed on the gate structure facing
the County Highway. The construction material used within the County Highway
right-of-way shall be as specified by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation. Reference the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual for
geometries, materials, gate and signage details and other requirements for
Emergency Access driveways. All gates and related appurtenances shall be
located outside of the County Highway right-of-way.

(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
ARTICLE V. REQUIRED HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS
§ 10.12.240 GENERAL.
   A.   Access facilities are the physical interface between a development and
the abutting County Highway. The economic success and vitality of the
development and the safety of the motoring public are both linked to efficient
traffic operations at the access intersections serving the development.
   B.   In order to maintain safe and efficient traffic operations at the
access intersection and to ensure that the impact of development accessing a
County Highway does not result in a degradation of traffic operations,
improvements to the County Highway System may be required.
COMMENTARY: Increases in traffic from development result in two (2) types of
impacts to the County Highway System:
   • Impacts that occur at the access point(s) and adjacent intersections that
result In an increase in delays at those specific locations and are directly
attributable to a specific development.
   • Cumulative impacts to the overall roadway network that result from the
incremental increases in traffic from developments.
In order to prevent a degradation in traffic operations at access locations,
and adjacent intersections, improvements to the County Highway at the access
location and adjacent intersections maybe required.
   C.   To mitigate the cumulative impact of increased traffic from new
developments to the overall roadway network, additional right-of-way shall be
dedicated to facilitate the County in making future area-wide improvements to
the County Highway system as a result of overall traffic growth generated at
both the development access point(s) and the incremental increase in overall
traffic.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.250 RIGHT-OF-WAY REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   1.   The County Highway rights-of-way serve a multitude of purposes
beyond just the immediate area for the physical roadway pavement. Room is also
needed for associated drainage and stormwater management facilities, snow
storage, utilities and other facilities, to provide buffer areas for traffic
safety, and to buffer the roadway from non-motorized facilities and adjacent
development.
      2.   If the property abutting a County Highway is to be subdivided,
developed, rezoned, undergoes a change in land use or density, or a Major
Access facility, or Emergency Access is being requested, the permittee shall
dedicate, or cause the dedication to occur, at no cost to the County,
sufficient land for right-of-way to meet the requirements of this Ordinance.
Dedication shall be across the entire frontage of a development and shall be
the greatest of:
         a.   Minimum widths depicted on
Table 10.12-1 based on the County Highway Access Classification
         b.   Minimum width to accommodate highway improvements required by
this Ordinance
         c.   Widths identified in completed Phase I/feasibility studies
conducted by the County, the Illinois Department of Transportation, or by
others with County concurrence on the section of County Highway where access or
development is being proposed.
      3.   If additional right-of-way is required from property not controlled
by the permittee in order to construct the highway improvements required for a
Major Access, then the permittee shall obtain the additional right-of-way in
the name of the County at no cost to the County or the McHenry County Division
of Transportation. The negotiation and acquisition process, including all
associated costs, of this additional right-of-way is the responsibility of the
party requesting access.
 
Table 10.12-1
Minimum Right-of-Way Requirements by County Highway Access Classification
County Highway Classification Minimum Right-of-Way Width
Designated Freeways           170 feet (85 ft. half R.O.W.)
Principal Arterials           140 feet (70 ft. half R.O.W.)
Arterials & Other Highways    110 feet (55 ft. half R.O.W.)
 
   B.   Right-of-way Radius at Intersections. The intersection of right-of-way
lines between a County Highway and an intersecting street/road or Major Access
facility that will become, or has the potential to become a public road or
street shall be designed and platted in the form of a 35-foot by 35-foot right-
of-way triangle. For County Highways classified as Principal Arterials or
Designated Freeways, the right-of-way triangle shall be a minimum of 50-foot by
50-foot. Right-of-way triangles larger than the above minimums may be required
by the McHenry County Division of Transportation if sight visibility (sight
distance) issues are present or the nature of the required roadway improvements
is such that additional area is required. Refer to the Permit Procedures and
Requirements Manual.
   C.   Wording on Plats. The following wording shall be used to dedicate
right-of-way on a plat of subdivision or a plat of dedication; “HEREBY
DEDICATED FOR PUBLIC ROAD PURPOSES.”
   D.   Right-of-Way Encumbrances.
      1.   All right-of-way to be dedicated shall be free and clear of any
existing encumbrances which would render the right-of-way in any manner or
form, unusable for road purposes, or would in any manner or form, result in any
extraordinary costs to the County at such times as said right-of-way is to be
used for road purposes.
      2.   Conveyance of right-of-way by means other than a Plat of Subdivision
shall result in a “fee simple” transfer of land. Quit Claim deeds are not an
acceptable means to convey right-of-way to the County.
   E.   Objects, Utilities and other Facilities In the Right-of-Way.
      1.   No new objects, trees, plantings, bushes, landscaping, signs, rocks,
debris, berms, detention or retention facilities or any other materials shall
be permitted within the right-of-way. Any new utilities or new facilities
requested for placement within the highway right-of-way shall be permitted
separately pursuant to the requirements found in Article VI of this Ordinance.
      2.   In those instances where additional right-of-way is being dedicated
as required by this Ordinance, existing objects, trees, plantings, bushes,
landscaping, signs, rocks, debris, berms, detention or retention facilities,
and other such obstacles may be required by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation to be removed from or relocated outside of the new right-of-way
line along the entire frontage of the development.
      3.   Existing above ground utilities shall be relocated to the right-of-
way line (outside edge of the right-of-way adjacent to the private property
line) across the entire frontage of the development. Underground utilities and
facilities shall be relocated to ensure that the utilities or facilities are
out from under proposed pavement, shoulders and/or curb lines and in areas as
required through the McHenry County Division of Transportation permitting
process, or that would interfere with the structure of the roadway base.
      4.   Underground utilities and facilities that would be in such a
location as to cause disruption to the roadway pavement and motoring public by
routine maintenance activities of the utility or facility shall also be
relocated out from under proposed pavements, shoulders and/or curb lines.
   F.   Right-of-Way Restoration. Upon completion of any construction work
within the County Highway right-of-way, the right-of-way shall be restored by
the permittee to the same or better condition than existed prior to the work.
Those facilities and roadway appurtenances (signs, guardrail, culverts, etc.)
within the County Highway right-of-way that are damaged as a result of the
permitted work shall be repaired or replaced immediately by the permittee to
the satisfaction of, and at no cost to, the McHenry County Division of
Transportation.
   G.   Plat of Subdivision Requirements and Other Permit Coordination. The
Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/2) requires simultaneous submittal of preliminary and
final plat of subdivision to both the municipality in which the subdivision is
located and to the McHenry County Division of Transportation for subdivisions
that front a County Highway and/or are requesting access to a County Highway.
      1.   Requirements Prior to Signature by County Engineer. The primary
concerns for plat review and approval are safety, number, location and type of
access points, future highway needs, provision for utilities outside of the
right-of-way, and the related impacts to the County Highway System. The County
Engineer may not sign a plat that is submitted for review and approval by the
permittee if there are unresolved issues regarding permit submittal
requirements, access location, extent and nature of roadway improvements as
required by this Ordinance, or inadequate right-of-way to construct the
required improvements.
      2.   Sidewalk or Shared-Use Path Easements - Plat of Subdivision.
Separate easements may be required to be platted outside of any required
dedication of right-of-way to allow for the installation of any required, or
planned future sidewalks or shared-use paths. Said easements shall extend
across the entire frontage of the subdivision adjacent to the County Highway
and may occupy the same area as any municipal utility/facility easement. The
municipality having jurisdiction over the approval of easements outside of the
right-of-way should be contacted to determine the requirements for joint-use
easements and requirement for sidewalks or shared-used paths.
         c.   Plat of Subdivision or Dedications- Submittal of Recorded
Documents. Any required Plat of Subdivision, Plat of Dedication, or other
instrument conveying fee simple title of land for right-of-way shall be
properly recorded and copies of the recorded document, with document number,
submitted to the McHenry County Division of Transportation. Failure to submit
recorded copies of plats or other documents may result in the McHenry County
Division of Transportation withholding issuance of an access permit or the
release of Performance Guarantees for required highway improvements.
         d.   Plat Language and County Highway Certificate.
            (1)   Specific language notes and required County Highway
Certificates specifically related to the County Highway, or access points and
right-of-way will be required for any plat that requires signature by the
County Engineer.
            (2)   The following notes shall appear individually on all plats
that have frontage on a County Highway and/or are requesting access to a County
Highway.
               (a)   Proposed right-of-way shall be labeled as “HEREBY
DEDICATED TO MCHENRY COUNTY FOR PUBLIC ROAD PURPOSES”.
               (b)   Existing right-of-way shall be labeled as “Heretofore
Dedicated for Public Road Purposes”. If the existing right-of-way was by
previous dedication, the document number for that dedication shall be
referenced on the Plat.
               (c)   The County Highway name and County Highway Route number
shall be provided on the Plat. County Highway names and corresponding County
Highway Route numbers can be found in the Permit Procedures and Requirements
Manual.
               (d)   All Plats of Subdivision shall include an access
restriction note that states: “Direct access to the County Highway known as
                 , Route                  , from lots number                  
is prohibited”. All lots shall be listed by number individually for all
properties with frontage on the County Highway (e.g. lots 1, 2, 3 and 4, not
lots 1-4).
               (e)   The following note shall be placed on all plats: “In
accordance with Chapter 605, Act 5, § 9-115.1 of the Illinois Highway Code, it
is unlawful for any person to construct or cause to be constructed any drainage
facility for the purpose of detention or retention of water within a distance
of 10 feet plus one and one half times the depth of any drainage facility
adjacent to the right-of-way of any public highway without the written
permission of the highway authority having jurisdiction over the public
highway. It is unlawful for any person to construct, or cause to be constructed
any earthen berm such that the toe of such berm will be nearer than 10 feet to
the right-of-way of any public highway without the written permission of the
highway authority having jurisdiction over the public highway”.
               (f)   Include a signature block for the County Engineer as
provided in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.260 REQUIRED HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS.
   Access to a County Highway shall not result in a degradation of traffic
operations at the location of the access point and adjacent existing
intersections. As such, and as a condition of issuance of a Major Access
Permit, improvements to the County Highway at the access location and adjacent
intersections may be required to mitigate the impacts of new, development-
related, traffic.
   A.   Cost of Access Facilities and Improvements to County Highways. The
permittee shall be solely responsible for paying all costs associated with the
design and construction of an access facility and all costs associated with the
design and construction of any improvements to a County Highway and/or any
roadway intersecting a County Highway or any roadway within the limits of a
required improvement to a County Highway, as required by this Ordinance. Costs
to the permittee shall include, but are not limited to the following:
      1.   Preparation of engineering plans, studies, information or data
required in order for the McHenry County Division of Transportation to review
an access request and any revision thereto.
      2.   Obtain and conduct traffic counts and preparation of a Traffic
Impact Study and any revisions thereto (see §
10.12.260B.)
      3.   Preparation of concept and preliminary geometric plans.
      4.   Preparation of a traffic signal warrant analysis and any revisions
thereto.
      5.   Preparation of stormwater management studies, hydraulic and
hydrologic studies, floodplain studies, and any revisions thereto. The McHenry
County Division of Transportation shall be contacted prior to the development
of any such studies for specific format and analysis requirements.
      6.   Preparation of engineering plans, specifications, estimates of cost
and any revisions thereto.
      7.   Relocation of utilities and other facilities located within the
right-of-way out from underneath existing or proposed pavement.
      8.   Relocation of above-ground utilities (including utility poles) and
other facilities to the proposed right-of-way line (see §
10.12.250E.)
      9.   Removal of objects in the right-of-way (see §
10.12.250E.)
      10.   Obtaining and posting Performance Guarantees, Certificates of
Insurance, and Maintenance Guarantees.
      11.   All other costs associated with an access facility and improvements
to a County Highway as required by this Ordinance.
   B.   Traffic Impact Study.
      1.   All applications for Major Access Permits shall include submittal of
a Traffic Impact Study prepared by a licensed Professional Engineer who has
also been certified as a Professional Traffic Operations Engineer (P.T.O.E.) by
the Transportation Professional Certification Board (T.P.C.B.). A Traffic
Impact Study shall also be required when the permittee is applying for a
variance from this Ordinance (refer to Article VIII.) The Traffic Impact Study
shall bear the name, signature and seal of the Professional Engineer and be
included on any updates or subsequent revisions to the Traffic Impact Study. In
addition the traffic engineer shall also include their P.T.O.E. certification
number.
      2.   The permittee shall be responsible for all costs associated with
preparation of the Traffic Impact Study including updates and subsequent
revisions including review fees that may be required if an outside consultant
is retained to review the study. The requirements, scope and format for the
Traffic Impact Study shall be based on the Access Management Highway
Classification, as defined by this Ordinance, for the County Highway the access
is being requested from and as described fully in the Permit Procedures and
Requirements Manual. The Traffic Impact Study shall be no more than one (1)
year old at the time of submittal.
      3.   The Traffic Impact Study must be approved by the McHenry County
Division of Transportation prior to the determination of any required access-
related improvements to the County Highway.
   C.   Signalized Intersection Level-of-Service Requirements. Analysis of all
signalized Intersections shall be based on the methodologies presented in the
“Highway Capacity Manual” published by the Transportation Research Board (TRB).
Level-of-Service (LOS) criteria range from “A” (good) to “F” (poor) and are
based on average delay. The permittee shall be responsible for making any
required improvements to existing adjacent signalized intersections to ensure
that the LOS letter grade does not decrease and that the volume to capacity
ratio (v/c) does not significantly degrade as a result of a proposed
development. Detailed analysis requirements are included in the Permit
Procedures Requirements Manual.
   D.   Auxiliary Turn Lane Requirements for Major Access Locations.
      1.   Safe and efficient traffic operations along a County Highway are
directly related to minimizing the speed differential of the vehicles traveling
along the County Highway. Construction of auxiliary turn lanes is the most
effective means of limiting the speed differential between a turning vehicle
and through traffic that follows. In this Ordinance, the County Highways are
separated into four (4) classifications (County Freeways, Principal Arterials,
Arterials, and Other) as depicted on the Access Classification Map.
      2.   Mobility of through traffic on all County Highways, especially those
designated as County Freeways and Principal Arterials is critical to the safe
and efficient operation of the County Highway System. Therefore, auxiliary
left-turn lanes and right-turn lanes shall be required at all Major Access
locations on any County Highway that is designated as a County Freeway or
Principal Arterial.
      3.   For those County Highways classified as Arterials and Other, the
relationship between the volume of turning traffic at an access location and
the volume of through traffic on the County Highway shall be used to determine
whether auxiliary left-turn and right-turn lanes; are required.
         a.   Auxiliary Left-Turn Lane Requirements (Arterials and Other County
Highways). The warrants for requiring construction of a left-turn lane on those
County Highways designated as Arterials and Other on the Access Classification
Map shall be based on the traffic volumes developed In the Traffic Impact Study
and the requirements of
Figure 10.12A.
         b.   Auxiliary Right-Turn Lane Requirements (Arterials and Other
County Highways). The warrants for requiring construction of a right-turn lane
on those County Highways designated as Arterials and Other on the Access
Classification Map shall be based on the traffic volumes developed in the
Traffic Impact Study and the requirements of
Figure 10.12B.

(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.270 JOINT HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS.
   In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to the motoring public to
construct access improvements as part of a larger overall improvement or in
conjunction with programmed County Highway Improvements. In order to minimize
disruptions to the public, the County Engineer may require access related
improvements to proceed in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.
   A.   Programmed Improvements.
      1.   If McHenry County has a highway improvement programmed for the
section of County Highway for which a permittee is applying for access and the
permittee, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance is required to
construct improvements to the County Highway as a result of the proposed access
facility, then the County Engineer may recommend and require that both
improvements proceed simultaneously and as a coordinated joint improvement.
      2.   For such improvements, the County Engineer shall have the option to
require a formal joint agreement, to be approved by the County Board that shall
specifically provide for the responsibilities and obligations of the County and
the permittee as related to the joint improvement. Said joint agreement shall
be prepared by the McHenry County Division of Transportation. Nothing in this
section shall be construed as to relieve the permittee of any financial
responsibilities related to an access facility.
      3.   If the permittee or’ the County Engineer determines that a joint
agreement for an improvement is not appropriate, the County Engineer shall
specify the conditions to be made part of the access permit such that the
construction of the access facility does not interfere with the County’s
proposed highway improvement project.
   B.   Ongoing Improvements.
      1.   In certain circumstances, the McHenry County may already have a
highway improvement under construction for the section of County Highway for
which an access is being requested. If said access, under the provisions of
this Ordinance, requires improvements to the County Highway that is already
under construction by the McHenry County Division of Transportation, then the
County Engineer may recommend that the highway improvements required for the
access facility be incorporated into the ongoing County Highway improvement
project by means of a formal joint agreement or by a donation of money, from
the party requesting access, to be made a part of the access permit. If a
formal Joint agreement is recommended, the parties shall proceed forth as
specified in §
10.12.270A.
      2.   If a donation of money is recommended by the County Engineer, the
permittee shall have the option to agree in writing to an amount as determined
by the McHenry County Division of Transportation based on the contract unit
prices for the ongoing County Highway improvement. The amount shall be
sufficient to cover the cost of the required access improvement, including
engineering costs and construction supervision, preparation of plats and legal
descriptions, appraisal and negotiation fees, and recording fees. The donation
shall be subject to acceptance by the Transportation Committee In accordance
with 605 ILCS 5/5-101.7 et seq., as amended. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as to relieve the permittee of any financial responsibilities related
to an access facility.
      3.   If the Transportation Committee elects not to proceed with a
donation, the County Engineer may direct the McHenry County Division of
Transportation staff to specify the conditions to be made a part of the access
permit approval so that construction of the access improvement by the permittee
required for the access facility shall not interfere with the ongoing County
Highway improvement project.
   C.   Donations. The Transportation Committee, in accordance with 605 ILCS 5/
5-101.7 et seq., as amended, shall have the authority to accept money or right-
of-way (beyond the level identified as a minimum requirement in this Ordinance)
or additional detention or compensatory floodplain storage donated from any
source and to use the same for County Highway purposes to mitigate for impacts
to the County Highway System from the proposed development.
   D.   Coordination of Development.
      1.   If property abutting a County Highway is being developed and access
is requested to the County Highway, it shall be the responsibility of the
permittee to effect any coordination necessary to comply with the requirements
and provisions of this Ordinance and requirements of the governmental authority
having land-use regulatory authority.
      2.   The issuance of an access permit by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation shall not be construed as to relieve the permittee of any
responsibility to secure any other permits or to comply with any requirements
of any other governmental authority having any jurisdictional responsibilities
as it relates to a development. The permittee shall also be responsible for
securing any permits or complying with any other requirements of any
governmental authority as they may relate to the construction of an access
facility or related highway improvement.
   E.   Coordination of Adjacent Developments. If two or more separate
properties abutting a County Highway are being developed during the same
approximate time period and they are located in the same general vicinity of
each other, the McHenry County Division of Transportation may require each
permittee to cooperate jointly to design and construct their respective roadway
access improvements as a joint and coordinated effort.
COMMENTARY: A joint improvement would require a single set of engineering plans
and result in a single construction project for all of the required
improvements, thus minimizing disruptions to the motoring public and reducing
or eliminating the need for removal and reconstruction of newly placed roadway
improvements that would typically have been installed by the first developer
requesting access.

(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.320 COMPLETION OF WORK/ REQUEST FOR FINAL INSPECTION.
   Upon completion of the access and roadway improvements to the County
Highway, including but not limited to final paving, drainage, striping and
restoration work, the Resident Engineer shall certify in writing to the McHenry
County Division of Transportation that all work has been completed in
conformance with the requirements of the Ordinance, any permit conditions and
plan requirements and shall request the McHenry County Division of
Transportation perform a final inspection. Without submittal of an acceptable
final certification and request for final inspection letter, the McHenry County
may not provide a final inspection or release the Performance Guarantee.
Payment of any required inspection fees due the McHenry County Division of
Transportation shall also be paid at this time. (Reference the latest edition
of the Permit Fee Schedule). A sample letter for use by Resident Engineers can
be found in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
   A.   Final Inspection by McHenry County Division of Transportation.
      1.   Upon completion of the permitted work, including restoration,
receipt of the written request from the Resident Engineer for a final
inspection and payment of any inspection fees that are required, the McHenry
County Division of Transportation will conduct an inspection and provide the
permittee or their representative with a written report of deficiencies (punch-
list items), if any, that require corrective action. The Resident Engineer
shall request follow-up inspection(s) as needed until all deficiencies noted in
the McHenry County Division of Transportation inspection reports have been
corrected. Additional inspection fees may apply and shall be paid prior to
follow-up inspections as required by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation. (Reference the latest edition of the Permit Fee Schedule).
      2.   The McHenry County Division of Transportation may require field

amendments and successor documents to the aforementioned documents.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
ARTICLE VI. UTILITY/FACILITY REQUIREMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT UTILITY COORDINATION
REQUIREMENTS
§ 10.12.340 GENERAL.
   A.   In order to provide for the safe placement of utilities and facilities
within the rights-of-ways of County Highways, safeguard the motoring public,
promote the orderly and efficient use of public rights-of-way and to ensure
that said placement of utilities and facilities does not inhibit the County’s
ability to maintain, operate and improve the County Highway System it is hereby
declared to be the policy of the County to regulate the placement, removal,
relocation, modification, or abandonment of utilities and facilities within the
rights-of-way of County Highways through the rules, requirements and
regulations established by this Ordinance and the specifications, requirements
and conditions contained in the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
Illinois Statute (605 ILCS 5/9-113) requires approval by the appropriate
highway authority for the placement, removal, relocation, modification, or
abandonment of utilities and facilities within public highways including their
placement within the rights-of-way of County Highways. For County Highways in
McHenry County, the appropriate highway authority shall be the McHenry County
Division of Transportation.
   B.   Any public utility company, municipal corporation or other public or
non-public corporation, association or person may request permission to locate,
place or construct upon, under or along any highway, utilities or facilities
provided that the entity receive written consent from the McHenry County
Division of Transportation prior to the placement of the utility or facility
within the right-of-way of a County Highway. However, because it is impossible
to anticipate the future needs of the County Highway System, the McHenry County
Division of Transportation has the right to deny any application for the
placement of utilities or facilities for any reasonable cause or for safety
concerns when such placement would, in the opinion of the McHenry County
Division of Transportation be detrimental to current or future needs of the
County Highway System.
COMMENTARY: The primary function of a County Highway and its associated right-
of-way is for highway purposes by the motoring public. The placement, removal,
relocation, modification, or abandonment of any utility or facility within the
right-of-way is secondary and subservient to providing for the safe and
efficient movement of vehicular traffic on a County Highway. Given the limited
space available in County Highway rights-of-way and the need to provide for the
placement and improvement of roadway pavement and associated appurtenances,
these highway related uses must take precedence and priority over the
placement, removal, relocation, modification or abandonment of any utility or
facility within the right-of-way of a County Highway.
   C.   The absence of rules and regulations governing utility and facility
placement results in conflicts between the utilities and facilities and the
highway pavements and appurtenances. These conflicts can result in significant
costs to the County and utility/facility operators to resolve. These
regulations are adopted in order to minimize these conflicts and thereby assist
in the efficient operation, maintenance and improvement of the County Highway
System.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.350 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   1.   A permit shall be required for the replacement, relocation, or
removal of an existing utility or facility and any manner or form of work
relating to the construction or placement of a new utility or facility within
the right-of-way of any County Highway. All work associated with a utility or
facility to be placed or already existing within the right-of-way of a County
Highway shall be performed at no cost to the County.
      2.   If the proposed utility or facility work is to be accomplished as
part of an access permit or adjacent private development project, said utility
or facility work shall be included on the engineering plans submitted for the
access permit or adjacent private development project, but shall be permitted
separately by the respective utility company or public agency responsible for
the maintenance and operation of the utility or facility.
      3.   Non-public utilities or non-public facilities are generally
prohibited from placement within County Highway rights-of-way. Special approval
by the McHenry County Division of Transportation will be considered on a case-
by-case basis with additional requirements, specifications and guarantees.
      4.   Any placement, relocation, reconstruction, repair, modification,
removal or enlargement does not relieve the permittee from obtaining permission
from the legal property owner where the County Highway right-of-way is in the
form of an easement or dedication limited to public road or highway purposes.
   COMMENTARY: Any major utility or facility work shall require a permit.
   Examples of the types of utilities requiring a permit include, but are not
limited to, installation of new below ground electric lines, telephone lines,
telecommunication lines, cable television lines, and natural gas lines and all
related appurtenances, including service connections to individual users;
installation of new pole lines for various utilities; and installation or
replacement of municipal potable water or sanitary sewer lines.
      5.   Examples of the types of utilities requiring a permit include, but
are not limited to:
         a.   Cable television facilities and cable
         b.   Electric cables
         c.   Natural gas pipelines
         d.   Telecommunication cables
         e.   Service connections of utilities
         f.   Related appurtenances to above types of utilities
         g.   Installation or relocation of utility poles
      6.   Examples of the types of public facilities/utilities and non-public
facilities that may be permitted by the County include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Public Facilities/Utilities.
            (1)   Multi-use paths
            (2)   Fire or police emergency signaling systems
            (3)   Sanitary sewers, potable watermains, and related services
            (4)   Pedestrian crossing structures
            (5)   Pedestrian crossing features (sidewalk, special signage).
            (6)   Public transportation shelters
            (7)   Sidewalks
            (8)   Storm drainage systems not operated or maintained by the
County
            (9)   Street lighting
            (10)   Traffic signals
            (11)   Red light running cameras
            (12)   Municipal or governmental owned or operated facilities
         b.   Non-Public Facilities.
            (1)   Contaminated and groundwater remediation piping
            (2)   Enclosed/underground conveyors for movement of granular
materials under a highway
            (3)   Monitoring wells
      7.   Appurtenances shall consist of above ground facilities such as
junction boxes, switch gear, pedestals, transformers and below ground equipment
such as vaults, junction chambers, etc.
      8.   Not all County Highway rights-of-way are owned fee-simple by the
County. Some rights-of-way are in the form of easements, prescriptive right-of-
ways or dedications for the sole purpose of providing and allowing for the
existence, use and maintenance of the roadway and related appurtenances. In
these circumstances, legal ownership of the adjacent private property may
extend to the center of the roadway. It is the responsibility of the utility or
facility owner to determine whether the placement of said utility or facility
requires property owner’s permission (see §
10.12.350F.).
   B.   Purpose of County Highways. The rights-of-way of County Highways are
established for the location of highway pavements and their related
appurtenances. In order to minimize impacts to adjacent private properties and
to minimize the cost to the motoring public, County Highway rights-of-ways are
minimally established for highway uses and do not include additional areas for
utilities and facilities. Therefore, all utilities and facilities shall be
located within such rights-of-ways in a manner that will not impede or conflict
with any existing highway or associated appurtenance or any future improvement
or widening of a highway and the construction or reconstruction of associated
appurtenances, whether by a County construction project or a permitted
improvement by others. A utility or facility is not considered a highway
appurtenance. Installation of any above ground utility appurtenances must meet
the clear zone setback requirements, for installations proposed within the
County Highway right-of-ways.
   C.   Required Relocation of Existing Utilities and Facilities.
      1.   Whenever a County Highway is improved, widened, reconstructed,
resurfaced, modified or additional lanes are added by the County or a permitted
improvement of the County Highway is constructed by others, the owner of the
existing utility or facility or the permittee shall relocate, remove, or modify
the utility or facility from under the widened pavement and shoulders or curb
line or out of the limits of the improvement at no cost to the County. The
McHenry County Division of Transportation shall determine the need and limits
for said relocation, removal or modification on a case-by-case basis.
      2.   Any and all additional or extraordinary costs that may be incurred
by the County due to the presence, abandonment, or proposed placement of any
utility or facility within the right-of-way of a County Highway shall be borne
solely by the owner of said utility or facility. Payment to the County for said
additional or extraordinary costs shall be made as determined by the McHenry
County Division of Transportation.
   D.   Conflicts with Existing Utilities and Facilities/Insufficient Space.
      1.   In the event that the placement, construction, relocation,
modification, enlargement or any manner of work to be performed on any utility
or facility, existing or proposed, within the County Highway rights-of-way
results in insufficient space for the placement of said utility or facility,
the County is not responsible for providing additional space in any manner or
form. In the event the County determines that there is insufficient space
within the right-of-way for the proposed placement construction, relocation,
modification, enlargement or proposed related construction activities or that
such work would be detrimental to the operation, maintenance or safety of the
County Highway, the proposed work may not be permitted. Installation of any
above ground utility appurtenances must meet the clear zone setback
requirements, for installations proposed within the County Highway right-of-
ways.
      2.   In the event of a conflict between any existing or proposed utility
or facility located or proposed to be located within the right-of-way of a
County Highway, said conflict shall be resolved by the owners of said utilities
or facilities. The resolution of any conflict shall not result in the County
incurring any costs, either now or in the future, and shall not; result in an
undue delay to the utility or facility construction that would unduly impede
traffic or hinder the operation of the County Highway. The resolution of any
conflict must be a part of any permitted work and shall be approved by the
McHenry County Division of Transportation through the permitting process
required by this Ordinance if the proposed resolution involves work to be
performed within the right-of-way of a County Highway.
   E.   Other Agency Permits and Approvals. The issuance of a permit under the
rules, regulations, and specifications of this Ordinance does not relieve,
excuse, diminish or negate, in any manner or form, the authority, rules,
requirements or permission that may be required by any governmental authority
or person that regulates the placement, location, construction, reconstruction,
enlargement, removal, relocation, modification, abandonment, or any manner of
work to be performed on any utility or facility subsequent to the issuance of a
permit under the provisions of this Ordinance. The owner of the utility or
facility may be required to submit evidence of approval and compliance with
rules, regulations and specifications of any other applicable regulatory agency
or person for the work to be performed within the right-of-way of a County
Highway.
   F.   Property Owner’s Permission. The issuance of a permit under the rules,
regulations, requirements and specifications of this Ordinance does not relieve
the permittee from obtaining permission from the legal property owner to locate
the utility or facility on any County Highway where the right-of-way is in the
form of an easement or dedication for public road purposes and the County does
not own title to the right-of-way. The rules, regulations, requirements, and
specifications of such permission shall not be in conflict with the provisions
of this Ordinance nor supersede, diminish, alter, or in any manner or form
interfere with use of said easement or public road dedication, nor shall said
permission result in any costs to the County either now or in the future. It
shall be the responsibility of the permittee, not the McHenry County Division
of Transportation, to determine when permission is required from the legal
property owner. Failure to obtain permission can be just cause to deny issuance
of a permit by the County or to suspend or revoke an issued permit.
   G.   Commencement of Work. No work within the County Highway right-of-way
shall commence until such time as a permit is issued in accordance with the
rules and regulations of this Ordinance. No delivery, stock piling or temporary
placement of materials, storage of equipment, or other preparatory work shall
take place within the County Highway right-of-ways until such time as a permit
is issued in accordance with the rules and regulations of this Ordinance.
   H.   Emergency Maintenance Work.
      1.   Emergency work related to utilities and facilities shall not require
issuance of a permit in advance of said emergency subject to the following
conditions:
         a.   The emergency work is immediately required to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare.
         b.   The emergency work is required as a result of a natural disaster,
flooding, storm-related damage, or other state of emergency.
         c.   The McHenry County Division of Transportation is notified during
normal business hours of the required emergency work. If the emergency occurs
after normal business hours, the McHenry County Division of Transportation
shall still be notified within twenty-four (24) hours of identification of the
emergency work and with joint notification to the McHenry County Sheriffs
Department or the local municipality which has police jurisdiction if the
highway requires lane closures.
         d.   The emergency work is limited to interim repair or maintenance
activities of the utility or facility in order to remove the immediate hazard
or potential hazard to the public.
         e.   All necessary traffic control is provided in accordance with the
requirement of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
         f.   A permit is applied for, after the fact, that clearly identifies
the nature and location of the emergency work as would have normally been
submitted if the work had not been of an emergency nature.
      2.   Initiation of emergency repairs or maintenance as authorized under
this provision that subsequently require permanent reconstruction, modification
or relocation of the utility or facility does not relieve, excuse, diminish or
negate, in any manner or form the requirements of this Ordinance that would
otherwise be applicable to the reconstruction, relocation, modification or
other major work including issuance of a permit in accordance with all of the
applicable requirements, regulations, rules or specifications required by this
Ordinance.
   I.   Protection of Highway Pavements.
      1.   Open-cutting of County Highway pavement for the placement,
modification, enlargement or alteration of existing utilities or facilities is
generally prohibited, with possible exceptions given for emergency cases or
other applications where it is determined appropriate by the McHenry County
Division of Transportation to permit open cutting. Requests for open cutting of
a County Highway pavement will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and then
only when all other options for crossing the County Highway have been pursued
and no feasible options remain. Written documentation indicating the
impracticality of alternate means of crossing must be submitted along with any
request for open-cutting.
      2.   Should existing utilities or facilities underneath existing County
Highway pavements or shoulders require modification, enlargement, or
alteration, the McHenry County Division of Transportation may prohibit such
work and require, as a condition of the permit, the placement of a new utility
or facility out from underneath the pavement, shoulder or curb lines in order
to replace the existing utility or facility.
      3.   County Highway pavement shall not be broken, cracked or damaged in
any manner or form. Equipment with grozzer pads, cleats, studs, or tracks shall
not be operated or allowed on any highway pavement.
      4.   Any dirt, mud, or any other form of debris shall be immediately

timely manner, upon written notification by the County, the McHenry County
Division of Transportation may, but has no duty to, order that the repair work
be done in order to correct said damage. The owner of the utility or facility
shall reimburse the County at a rate not to exceed one hundred and thirty
percent (130%) of the costs incurred by the County and shall cease any and all
other work authorized under the permit until such time as reimbursement has
been made and alternate construction methods, acceptable to the McHenry County
Division of Transportation, have been submitted and approved by the McHenry
County Division of Transportation.

§ 10.12.360 PERMIT TYPES.
   A.   Construction, maintenance, placement, removal, relocation,
modification, or any other utility and facility work governed by this Ordinance
shall be granted via either a Utility or Facility Permit. The four categories
that fall under those permit types are:
      1.   Public Utility Permit
      2.   Municipal Utility or Facility
      3.   Non-Public Utility
      4.   Emergency Maintenance
   B.   Public Utility Permit.
      1.   Public Utility permits may be granted to those utilities that are
listed with the Illinois Commerce Commission as a public utility or have a
current franchise or license agreement with the County. Those utilities with
current franchise or license agreements shall not be subject to the permit fees
authorized under this Ordinance.
      2.   The presence of a current, franchise or license agreement with the
County does not relieve, excuse, diminish or negate, in any manner or form, the
rules, regulations, requirements, and specifications that are be imposed on all
utility and facility permittees as authorized under this Ordinance.
   C.   Municipal Utility or Facility.
      1.   Any municipal utility or facility that is proposed to be placed
within a County Highway right-of-way shall require the municipality or
government entity responsible for said utility or facility to be the permittee.
Such permit projects shall not list the contractor or developer as the
permittee. This applies to installation of municipal utilities or facilities
associated with a new development where a private developer is responsible for
the cost and installation of the municipal utility or facility that will be
accepted for maintenance and operation by the municipality upon completion of
the work.
      2.   Issuance of a permit for municipal utilities and facilities under
this Ordinance in which a developer is installing or paying to install a
municipal utility or facility within a County Highway right-of-way does not
relieve, excuse, diminish or negate, in any manner or form, the responsibility
of the municipality to ensure that permitted work is constructed within the
requirements, rules, regulations and specifications required by this Ordinance,
including, but not limited to, providing adequate supervision of construction
activities and installation of proper traffic control.
      3.   In the event that any work permitted under this Ordinance for a
municipal utility or facility is progressing in an unsatisfactory or
potentially unsatisfactory manner, it shall be the responsibility of the
municipality to take action to immediately remedy and alleviate the
unsatisfactory work.
      4.   Issuance of a permit for a municipal utility or facility does not
relieve the municipality or government entity from the requirements of §
10.12.350C.of this Ordinance to relocate, at no cost the County, any and all
utilities and facilities that may be in conflict with any improvements to the
County Highway as authorized or permitted by the County.
   D.   Non-Public Utility and Facility Permits.
      1.   Non-public utilities or non-public facilities are limited for
placement within County Highway rights-of-way. Special approval by the McHenry
County Division of Transportation will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
      2.   In the event that the McHenry County Division of Transportation
determines that placement of a non-public utility or facility is permissible,
the permittee may be required to provide as a condition of approval, a long-
term financial guarantee, in a manner and form acceptable to the McHenry County
Division of Transportation, to ensure that adequate financial resources are
available to the McHenry County Division of Transportation to remove the non-
public utility or non-public facility should the County require removal or
relocation of the non-public utility or non-public facility and the permittee
is no longer in existence, incapable, or refuses to perform said relocation or
removal work.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.370 BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES.
   A.   It is the policy of the County to encourage travel by pedestrian and
bicycle facilities. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be integral to the
transportation facilities of adjacent neighborhoods and development and shall
be located within adjacent development and neighborhoods with access across the
County Highway rights-of-way at acceptable locations as determined by the
McHenry County Division of Transportation.
   B.   Bicycle and pedestrian facilities to be constructed as part of new
developments and neighborhoods shall be located in easements outside of the
right-of-way of the County Highway. The County reserves the right to reject
requests for permitting of bicycle and pedestrian facilities where such
facilities would pose a hazard or potential hazard to either the motoring
public or pedestrian and bicycle traffic or insufficient area exists to
accommodate the proposed pedestrian and bicycle facilities without interfering
with highway pavements and related appurtenances. In such cases, the County
shall require that the pedestrian and bicycle facilities be located in
easements outside of the County Highway right-of- way.
   C.   Detailed design requirements and specifications, including desired
location and requirements for handicapped and accessible ramps are provided in
the Highway Standards.
   D.   Bicycle and pedestrian facilities permitted under this Ordinance shall
not be maintained by the County. The permittee for such facilities must be a
municipal or government agency with sufficient financial and operational
resources to properly maintain and operate said facilities in a manner
satisfactory to the County.

§ 10.12.390 RED-LIGHT RUNNING CAMERAS.
   A.   Public Act 94-0795 provides that a governmental agency in a
municipality or county may establish an automated traffic law enforcement
system (red-light running cameras.) County Highways extend through both
municipal (incorporated) and unincorporated areas. Traffic signals on County
Highways in McHenry County are under the jurisdiction of, and are the
maintenance responsibility of, the McHenry County Division of Transportation.
Installation of automated traffic law enforcement systems by a municipality or
County law enforcement agency on County traffic signals shall require the prior
written approval of the McHenry County Division of Transportation.
   B.   Review, approval, requirements, and conditions for permitting such
installations shall be in accordance with the published policy “Automated
Traffic Law Enforcement Systems Policy: Red Light Running (RLR) Camera

§ 10.12.400 DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED UTILITY/FACILITY CONFLICT SHEETS.
   A.   Any development requiring a Major Access Permit under the requirements
of this Ordinance shall also be required to develop a Utility/Facility Conflict
Sheet. This sheet shall show the following information for areas within the
County Highway right-of-way:
      1.   Existing pavement and shoulders, both paved and aggregate

COMMENTARY: The purpose of this submittal is to identify, prior to permit
approval and construction of the access and improvements to the County Highway,
any possible utility or facility conflicts that may exist and that may require
relocation or removal.
   C.   The Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual provides additional
guidance on the preparation of the utility conflict sheet.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
ARTICLE VII. SPECIAL PERMITS
§ 10.12.410 GENERAL.
   A.   In order to safeguard the users of the County Highway System, the
County’s right-of-ways must be kept free of obstructions that pose, or
potentially may pose, a safety or operational hazard to the public. Disruptions
to traffic that affect, or could potentially affect, the flow of traffic in a
detrimental manner shall not occur without the prior permission of the McHenry
County Division of Transportation. To ensure the safe and efficient flow of
traffic on the County Highway System, no activity shall take place within the
County Highway right-of-ways that inhibits the County’s ability to maintain,
operate and improve the County Highway System.
   B.   The Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended, provide for the County
Board and County Engineer to have the general supervision of the County Highway
System and to have the authority to regulate various activities that occur
along the County Highway System and within its right-of-ways. Permitting of
access, utilities and other facilities are addressed in Articles IV through VI
of this Ordinance. Those activities requiring permits not covered previously
are addressed within this Chapter. These activities and the statutory authority
to regulate such activities are listed below:
 
Statute            Regulation
605 ILCS 5/5-414   Permit required for temporary closure of County Highway
605 ILCS 5/9-115.1 Requires offset of detention and berms from right-of- way
605 ILCS 5/9-117   Permit required for grading and drainage facilities within
                   right-of-way
605 ILCS 5/9-118   Permit required for landscaping within the right-of-way
 
   C.   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the County to regulate those
activities for which statutory authority is granted through the rules and
regulations provided in this Ordinance and the specifications and requirements
of the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
   D.   Any municipal corporation or governmental entity, or other public or
private corporation, association or person may request permission to
temporarily close a County Highway or alter the County Highway right-of-ways
through landscaping, grading, or for the improvement or modification to the
existing flow of drainage along any highway provided that the entity receive
written consent from the McHenry County Division of Transportation prior to the
commencement of said activities.
COMMENTARY: The County Highway System is comprised primarily of arterial
highways that serve as a critical linkage between municipalities, employment
centers, provide critical access to State Highways, and service large volumes
of traffic, including the movement of emergency service vehicles. The primary
function of a County Highway and its associated right-of-way is for highway
purposes by the motoring public. The alteration of the County’s right-of-ways
or the temporary closure to traffic of any County Highway is secondary and
subservient to providing for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular
traffic on a County Highway. These highway-related uses must take precedent and
priority over such activities as temporary roadway closures and the
modification of the right-of-ways.
   E.   The absence of rules and regulations governing the temporary closure of
a County Highway or modifications to its right-of-ways could result in
significant congestion, delays in response time of emergency vehicles, or
result in significant costs to the motoring public through lost time,
deployment of County Highway resources to address said congestion and respond
to public inquiries and complaints. These regulations are adopted in order to
clearly communicate the requirements of the County, to minimize potential
conflicts, and thereby assist in the efficient operation, maintenance and
improvement of the County Highway System.
(Ord. O-200811-82-068, passed 11-6-2008)
§ 10.12.420 TEMPORARY HIGHWAY CLOSURES.
   A.   1.   In general, the temporary full or partial closure of a County
Highway shall not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that no other feasible
option exists and it is clearly demonstrated that a suitable detour route
exists that will not unduly delay the motoring public. Temporary closures shall
not impact the peak periods of traffic flow in the morning, late afternoon and
evening or as further restricted by the McHenry County Division of
Transportation. Temporary closures for emergency repairs, natural disasters or
other states of emergency are exempt from these regulations.
      2.   Temporary closure of a County Highway shall not result in any manner
or form of actual or incurred costs to the County. The County shall not be
responsible for advance notification of temporary closures, the detour route,
traffic control, including signage and police/Sheriff presence or assistance if
required. The McHenry County Division of Transportation has the sole authority
to request that the permittee have police or Sheriff’s presence during the
detour.
      3.   Examples of a temporary highway closure covered under this section
include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Movement of buildings or other large structures or appurtenances
across a County Highway
         b.   Setting of overhead structures such as pedestrian bridge.
         c.   Parades, marathons, festivals or other special events.
         d.   Filming of movies or commercials
   B.   General Requirements.
      1.   Unless required for emergency repairs, natural disasters, or other
states of emergency, only those County Highways that are designated as
Arterials or Other on the Access Classification Map are typically eligible for
temporary highway closures.
      2.   Temporary closure and application of procedures of any County
Highway shall be at the sole discretion of the McHenry County Division of
Transportation and may require additional conditions of approval, including,
but not limited to, significant coordination with local and regional emergency
service agencies, notification of media outlets, placement of changeable
message signs on the route prior to the closure, etc.
      3.   Extension, placement, modification, adjustment, or enlargements of
utilities or facilities as governed by Article VI of this Ordinance are not
eligible activities for temporary closure of a County Highway.
      4.   Temporary closure of a County Highway to reduce installation and
construction costs is not a legitimate reason under this Ordinance to permit a
temporary closure. Cost is not a deciding factor is determining whether an
alternate to closure of a County Highway is feasible.
   C.   Access for Emergency Service Providers. In the event a temporary
closure is permitted, provisions must be made to allow for the safe passage of
emergency vehicles through the closed portion of roadway. If it is not feasible
to permit passage of emergency vehicles during the closure, written approval
must be provided by all emergency service providers within a 10-mile radius and
the County’s Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and Sheriffs Department
indicating that it will not have a significant impact on their response or
transport activities. The McHenry County Division of Transportation may require
additional approvals by other emergency service providers as deemed necessary
by the McHenry County Division of Transportation.
   D.   Detour Requirements.
      1.   The permittee shall be responsible for providing adequate and
advance notification of a temporary closure, including advance communication of
detour routes. The requirements for said advance notification are provided in
the Permit Procedures and Requirements Manual.
      2.   The permittee shall be responsible for the advance placement,
operation, and maintenance of all traffic control devices including signing,
changeable message signs, temporary traffic signals, and other devices that may
be required for the temporary closure of a County Highway. Said devices shall
be inspected, maintained, repaired, and replaced by the permittee as required.
   E.   Access to Adjacent Property and Property Owner’s Permission.
      1.   Written approval from all adjacent property owners within the limits
of the temporary closure who will be affected shall be obtained by the
Permittee, with copies submitted to the McHenry County Division of
Transportation, prior to issuance of a permit. The permittee shall be
responsible for accommodating access to adjacent properties and/or providing
suitable measures for parking of vehicles unable to access said properties.
Temporary parking of vehicles must be accommodated outside of the right-of-way
of the County Highway and such provisions must be approved by the McHenry
County Division of Transportation prior to issuance of a permit.
      2.   Failure of the permittee to obtain written permission from adjacent
property owners can be just cause for the McHenry County Division of
Transportation to deny Issuance of a permit or to suspend or revoke an issued
permit.
   F.   Other Requirements.
      1.   Any activities associated with the temporary closure shall be
subject to the requirements of §
10.12.350I. and J. of this Ordinance as they relate to the protection of
pavement and other appurtenances, restoration of right-of-ways, including the
removal of any debris, litter, signs, or other appurtenances that were
temporarily in place during the closure.
      2.   In the event that the permittee fails to remove any debris, litter,
signs, or other appurtenances that were temporarily in place during the closure
upon cessation of the temporary closure, the County reserves the right, but
does not have the duty to, perform those activities necessary to remove any
debris, litter, signs, or other appurtenances that were temporarily in place
during the closure without advance notification and bill the permittee for said
costs.
   G.   Revocation of Permit.
      1.   The County reserves the right to require the cessation of all work
and removal of the temporary closure if any of the requirements of this
Ordinance or additional regulations, requirements and conditions imposed by the
permit have not taken place or if, in the opinion of the County, the traffic
control requirements are not in accordance with the requirements of the permit.
      2.   The County shall not be responsible for any damages, monetary or
otherwise, resulting from revocation of the permit.

shall be located In accordance with statutory requirement, which state that
said facilities shall be offset from the right-of-way at a minimum distance of
ten (10) feet plus one and one-half times the depth of the detention or
retention basin.
      2.   Those detention or retention facilities. whose location satisfies
the requirements of this Ordinance, but are still within the clear zone of the
highway and could pose, or potentially pose, a safety hazard to vehicles
leaving the right-of-way may be required to be offset from the right-of-way at
a greater distance or require additional protection as deemed necessary by the
McHenry County Division of Transportation.
   C.   Miscellaneous Drainage Facility Work.
      1.   Work within the right-of-way for rehabilitation of drainage ditches
or the replacement or repair of field tiles that intersect or cross the County
Highway right-of-ways will be allowed, provided that a permit, as required by
this Ordinance is obtained, and there are no negative impacts to the County
Highway right-of-way.
      2.   Drainage ditches parallel and adjacent to the County Highway and
contained within the right-of-ways of the County Highway are for the purpose of
collecting and conveying stormwater runoff from the County Highway pavements,
right-of-ways and adjacent areas tributary to the right-of-ways. Altering, re-
grading, filling or otherwise modifying these ditches is prohibited unless
written approval is obtained from the McHenry County Division of
Transportation.
   D.   Other Agency Permits and Approvals. The issuance of a permit by the
McHenry County Division of Transportation under the rules, regulations, and
specifications of this Ordinance does not relieve, excuse, diminish or negate,
in any manner or form, the authority, rules, requirements or permission that
may be required by any other governmental authority or person that regulates
the placement, location, construction, reconstruction, enlargement, removal,
relocation, modification, abandonment, or any manner of work to be performed on
any earthen berm or stormwater management facility.

disagrees with, the applicant can then make a written appeal request to the
County Engineer for a variance. The County Engineer shall review and may
approve variations to the requirements of this Ordinance so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest subserved thereby, provided that
such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of this Ordinance.
      2.   The owner must clearly prove that the variation will not be contrary
to the public interest and other objectives of this Ordinance and shall prove
that a practical difficulty or extraordinary hardship will result if the
variance is not granted. In particular, the owner shall establish and
substantiate that the variation conforms to the requirements and standards as
set forth in §
10.12.460E. of this Ordinance.
   B.   Variation Request Format. A petition for any variation from the
requirements of this Ordinance shall be made in writing to the County Engineer
and any required fees for processing of the variance paid for in advance. The
request shall identify the specific requirement of the Ordinance that the
petitioner is requesting a variance from along with all supporting
documentation.
   C.   Supporting Documentation and Studies.
      1.   The County Engineer may require that additional documentation, data,
engineering studies, traffic studies, or other information be submitted in
order to provide for a complete and thorough review of a variance request.
      2.   It is the owner’s responsibility to develop and provide said
additional documentation. The cost of said documentation, data, and studies
shall be the sole responsibility of the owner and no reimbursement of said
costs will be made if the applicant’s variance request is approved or denied.
   D.   Standards for Variation. A variation, in the strict application of the
provisions of this Ordinance, shall not be granted unless it is found that all
of the following relevant requirements and conditions are satisfied. The County
Engineer may grant variations whenever it is determined that all of the
following have been met:
      1.   The granting of a variation shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance and shall not
result in undue delay or congestion, shall not be detrimental to the safety of
the motoring public using the County Highway, and shall not limit the ability
of the McHenry County Division of Transportation to maintain or otherwise
improve a County Highway.
      2.   There must be proof of unique or existing special circumstances or
conditions where the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance
would deprive the owner of reasonable access. Circumstances that would allow
reasonable access by a road or street other than a County Highway,
circumstances where indirect or restricted access can be obtained, or
circumstances where engineering or construction solutions can be applied to
mitigate the condition shall not be considered unique or special.
      3.   There must be proof of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship.
It is not sufficient to show that greater profit or economic gain would result
if the variation would be granted. Furthermore, the hardship or difficulty
cannot be self-created or self-imposed; nor can it be established on this basis
by the owner who purchases with or without knowledge of the provisions of this
Ordinance. The difficulty or hardship must result from the strict application
of this Ordinance and it must be suffered directly and solely by the owner.
      4.   The variation is the least deviation from the requirements of this
Ordinance that will mitigate the hardship or practical difficulty.
   E.   Action by the County Engineer. Upon receipt of the required variance
application forms, supporting documentation, data, studies and other requested
information, and upon payment of all related variance fees, the County Engineer
shall review the variance request and render a decision fn writing to the
developer by certified mail within thirty (30) calendar days. The County
Engineer may stipulate conditions or impose requirements as a condition of
granting a variance from the provisions of this Ordinance.

identification and location markings, installation of signs on a wireless
telecommunication facility is prohibited.
   G.   Frequency Interference. Operation of the wireless telecommunication
facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by any public safety
agency for public safety communications, including, but not limited to,
streetlight and traffic signal transmissions. In the event that an interference
with the frequencies used by any public safety agency is detected, at any time,
the wireless provider is required to, at its own expense, either: (i)
reconfigure its antenna system’s frequency so that it does not interfere; or
(ii) cease transmitting/receiving from said unit; or (iii) remove the entirety
of the installation immediately upon notification of said interference. In the
event a relocation is required, the applicant will be required to apply for a
new permit for a wireless telecommunication facility with no assurances or
guarantees regarding the issuance of a permit.
   H.   Permission to Use Utility Pole or Alternative Antenna Structure. The
applicant of a wireless telecommunication facility shall submit to the County a
written copy of the approval from the owner of a utility pole or an alternative
antenna structure to mount the wireless telecommunication facility at that
specific location as part of the application for issuance of a permit by the
County.
   I.   Permission to Use Private Land. The applicant of a wireless
telecommunication facility is also responsible for obtaining approval from the
owner of any private land on which a utility pole or an alternative antenna
structure is located (such as when a public highway is by prescriptive
easement) to mount the wireless telecommunication facility at that specific
location. The County shall not be responsible for verifying whether or not said
approval is required.
   J.   Municipal Approval. When installing or collocating a wireless
telecommunication facility on County-owned infrastructure, within County
rights-of-ways that are also within a municipal boundary, the applicant shall
submit to the County a written copy of the approval from the local municipality
to mount the wireless telecommunication facility at that specific location as
part of the application for issuance of a permit by the County.
   K.   Restoration. Upon completion of the work authorized by permit under
this Ordinance, the applicant shall restore all disturbed or damaged areas of
the rights-of-ways to, at a minimum, their original condition. Said restoration
shall include, but is not limited to, any special landscaping or enhanced areas
that existed in the rights-of-ways prior to the commencement of the permitted
work, repairs to shoulders, ditches, parkways, curbs, and pavements. The County
shall bear no responsibility for costs associated with such restoration.
   L.   Replacement of County-Owned Infrastructure. If the County determines
that applicable codes or public safety regulations require the County-owned
infrastructure to be modified or replaced to support the requested collocation,
the County may require the applicant to modify or replace the County-owned
infrastructure at no cost to the County.
   M.   Adjustments or Relocations of Facilities. The applicant shall be
responsible for making adjustments, revisions, relocations and/or removal of
its facilities or abandoned facilities on County-owned infrastructure or within
the County rights-of-ways due to any County construction/reconstruction or
maintenance work.
   N.   Damage to County Property. The applicant shall be financially
responsible for any damage to County property caused by the installation,
maintenance, or operation of their equipment.
   O.   Abandonment and Removal. Any wireless telecommunication facility
located on County-owned infrastructure or within the County rights-of-ways that
is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, shall be
considered abandoned and the applicant of the facility shall remove same within
ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the County notifying the
applicant of such abandonment. Such notice shall be sent by certified or
registered mail, return- receipt-requested, by the County to such applicant at
the last known address of such applicant. In the case of wireless
telecommunication facilities attached to County-owned infrastructure, if such
facility is not removed within ninety (90) days of such notice, the County may
cause the removal of such facility and applicant shall be responsible for any
costs associated with the removal.
   P.   County Wireless Telecommunication Facilities. This Ordinance shall not
apply to wireless telecommunication facilities owned by the County.
   Q.   Service Connections. Other related improvements including, but not
limited to, buried electrical service, and buried fiber optic or cable
connections that are needed to service the wireless telecommunication facility
and are installed within County rights-of-ways beyond the physical utility pole
or alternative antenna structure require additional and separate permits. These
types of connections would be applied for by the respective utility provider
providing that service or connection (e.g. ComEd, ATT, etc.).
   R.   Application Fee. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or
similar agreement, or Federal, State or local law, all applications for permits
pursuant to this Ordinance shall be accompanied by a fee set forth in Appendix
A to this Ordinance for each wireless telecommunication facility addressed in
the application. Said fee shall be based on whether the wireless
telecommunication facility is being collocated on an existing utility pole or
an alternative antenna structure or the wireless telecommunication facility
included the installation of a new utility pole or alternative antenna
structure.
   S.   Annual Recurring Rate. The applicant shall pay to the County an annual
recurring rate set forth in Appendix A to this Ordinance for each permitted
location to collocate or install wireless telecommunication facilities on a
County-owned infrastructure within rights-of- ways. The applicant shall pay to
the County amounts as agreed upon pursuant to a separate agreement between the
wireless telecommunication facility and the County on a County-owned utility
pole outside of rights-of-ways.
   T.   Insurance Coverage. A Certificate of Insurance meeting the coverage
limits and insurance company ratings, as specified in the Illinois Department
of Transportation Standard Specifications, shall be submitted, at no cost to
the County, and shall name "McHenry County, the McHenry County Division of
Transportation, its elected and appointed officials, its employees and agents"
as additional insured parties. The Certificate shall also include proof of
evidence of Worker’s Compensation Insurance coverage. The insurance shall
include commercial general liability insurance with respect to the applicant’s
activities to afford minimum protection limits consistent with the County’s
requirements of other users of County-owned infrastructure or County rights-of-
ways, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
   U.   No Implied Warranties. As to objects, structures, poles, etc. which are
of, under or deemed to be those belonging to the County, onto which a wireless
telecommunication facility is to be considered for installation upon, no
implied or expressed warranty is given, granted, inferred, etc. as to its
capability to accept, support, etc. and/or provide for the needs of the
wireless telecommunication facility installation. The complete responsibility
for assuring the wireless support structure’s ability will rest and lie
entirely with the applicant. In the event the applicant’s wireless support
structure is deemed inadequate by the applicant, the County will be under no
obligation to augment or install a new alternative antenna structure for the
installation of the wireless telecommunication facility.
   V.   Hold Harmless Agreement. It is recognized that the system being created
by the wireless telecommunication facilities network requires an
interconnection and complete coverage in order for the system to function. It
is also recognized that in the course of events, weather conditions, traffic
accidents, and maintenance operations sometimes cause damage to County- owned
infrastructure and wireless support structures within rights-of-ways including,
but not limited to, utility poles, streetlights, traffic signals or towers.
Although replacement, reconstruction or re-installation of these elements are
typically accomplished in as efficiently, timely and economically a manner as
possible, there is no defined timeframe in which this repair work is completed.
In the event such incidents occur causing damage to these County-owned
infrastructure and wireless support structures which have wireless
telecommunication facilities mounted or otherwise attached to them, and in the
event such accidents or occurrences cause elements of or the complete wireless
telecommunication facility to be incapacitated, rendered inoperable, made
irreparable, or destroyed, the County and its elected and appointed officials
and employees shall be held harmless and under no obligation to replace,
reconstruct or re-install the County-owned infrastructure and wireless support
structures within a certain time frame nor shall there be any obligation by the
County to repair, reconfigure or replace any elements of the wireless
telecommunications facilities. Such duties and responsibilities for the repair,
reconfiguration or replacement of the wireless telecommunication facility shall
rest solely and at the expense of the applicant.
(Ord. 6744, passed 5-15-2018)
§ 10.16.040 VARIATIONS AND APPEALS.
   Under conditions of practical difficulty and extraordinary hardships, it may
be difficult to strictly comply with the requirements of this Ordinance. The
purpose of a variation is to provide relief from strict compliance with the
regulations and requirements of this Ordinance so long as the objectives of
this Ordinance are not compromised. It is the applicant’s responsibility to
clearly prove that a variation will not be contrary to the public interest and
that a practical difficulty or extraordinary hardship will result if a variance
is not granted.
   A.   Variance Procedures. If the County has denied a permit request or
assigned conditions to the permit that the applicant disagrees with, the
applicant can then make a written appeal request to the County Engineer, if the
wireless telecommunication facility is being located in the County Highway
rights-of-ways, or to the for a variance. The County Engineer shall review and
may approve variations to the requirements of this Ordinance so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest served thereby,
provided that such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this Ordinance. The applicant must clearly prove that the
variation will not be contrary to the public interest and other objectives of
this Ordinance and shall prove that a practical difficulty or extraordinary
hardship will result if the variance is not granted. In particular, the
applicant shall establish and substantiate that the variation conforms to the
requirements and standards as set forth in §
10.16.040A.3. of this Ordinance.
      1.   Variation Request Format. A petition for any variation from the
requirements of this Ordinance shall be made in writing to the County Engineer
and the fees for processing of the variance as set forth in Appendix A to this
Ordinance shall be paid for in advance. The request shall identify the specific
requirement of the Ordinance that the applicant is requesting a variance from
along with all supporting documentation.
      2.   Supporting Documentation and Studies. The County Engineer may
require that additional documentation, data, engineering studies, or other
information be submitted in order to provide for a complete and thorough review
of a variance request. It is the applicantfs responsibility to develop and
provide said additional documentation. The cost of said documentation, data,
and studies shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant and no
reimbursement of said costs will be made if the applicant’s variance request is
approved or denied.
      3.   Standards for Variation. A variation, in the strict application of
the provisions of this Ordinance, shall not be granted unless it is found that
all of the following relevant requirements and conditions are satisfied. The
County Engineer may grant variations whenever it is determined that all of the
following have been met:
         a.   The granting of a variation shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance and shall not
result in undue delay or congestion, shall not be detrimental to the safety of
the public, including the motoring public using the County Highway, and shall
not limit the ability of the County to maintain or otherwise improve County-
owned infrastructure or a County Highway.
         b.   There must be proof of unique or existing special circumstances
or conditions where the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance
would deprive the applicant of placement of a wireless telecommunication
facility.
         c.   There must be proof of practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship. It is not sufficient to show that greater profit or economic gain
would result if the variation would be granted. Furthermore, the hardship or
difficulty cannot be self-created or self-imposed; nor can it be established on
this basis by the applicant who enters into an agreement with or without
knowledge of the provisions of this Ordinance. The difficulty or hardship must
result from the strict application of this Ordinance, and it must be suffered
directly and solely by the applicant.
         d.   The variation is the least deviation from the requirements of
this Ordinance that will mitigate the hardship or practical difficulty.
      4.   Action by the County Engineer. Upon receipt of the required variance
application forms, supporting documentation, data, studies, and other requested
information, and upon payment of all related variance fees, the County Engineer
shall review the variance request and render a decision in writing to the
developer by certified mail within thirty (30) calendar days. The County
Engineer may stipulate conditions or impose requirements as a condition of
granting a variance from the provisions of this Ordinance.
   B.   Appeals Procedure. Objections to any formal action or decision made by
the County Engineer concerning issuance of a permit or variance under this
Ordinance can be appealed by the applicant to the Transportation Committee of
the McHenry County Board and adjudicated through an Appeal Hearing.
      1.   Appeal Hearing Request Requirements. Requests from the applicant for
an Appeal Hearing by the Transportation Committee shall be made in writing to
the County Engineer within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the County
Engineer’s written variance decision. If the written request is not received
within thirty (30) days, the applicant forfeits the right to an Appeal Hearing
before the Transportation Committee.
      2.   Appeal Hearing Date and Notice. The Appeal Hearing shall be
conducted at a regularly scheduled Transportation Committee meeting with the
Appeal Hearing date set by the Chairman of the Transportation Committee upon
notification by the County Engineer. The date of the Appeal Hearing shall
provide for sufficient notice and review time. The applicant will be notified,
in writing, of the date and time of the hearing no less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the hearing. The hearing shall take place no later than sixty (60)
days from receipt of the written request for an Appeal Hearing unless an
alternate date is agreed to by the County and the applicant.

12.24.030   Minimum roadway standards
   
12.24.040   Procedure
§ 12.24.010 INTRODUCTION.
   When residents adjacent to a private road are desirous of upgrading their
roadway so that the final bituminous (asphalt) surface can be constructed by
McHenry County and the roadway accepted for maintenance by Township Highway
Commissioner, the following minimum roadway standards and requirements must be
met prior to the County approving the roadway for paving:
(Res. R-9703-82-71, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 12.24.020 ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   The roadway must serve at least three adjacent residences or provide a
link between an existing publicly maintained roadway and the road serving the
residences.
   B.   Minimum dedicated right-of-way of forty (40) feet or greater (as may be
necessary for drainage and clear zone requirements.) In those circumstances
where right-of-way dedication does not currently exist, said dedication does
not have to be accomplished prior to applying for the program, but must be
finalized prior to roadway surfacing by the County (see procedure below.)
(Res. R-9703-82-71, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 12.24.030 MINIMUM ROADWAY STANDARDS.
   A,   Aggregate base course to a compacted thickness of ten (10) inches and a
width of nineteen (19) feet.
   B.   Bituminous surface course to a compacted thickness of two and one-half
(2 1/2) inches and a width of eighteen (18) feet.
   C.   Total roadway width of twenty-two (22) feet. (Eighteen (18) foot wide
pavement with two (2) foot wide shoulders along each edge.)
   D.   Adequate provisions for roadway drainage.
   E.   Unobstructed clear-zone meeting the requirements of the Illinois
Department of Transportation Bureau of Local Roads and Streets Administrative
Policies Manual. (Note: this clear-zone is typically ten (10) feet from the
edge of pavement.)
(Res. R-9703-82-71, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 12.24.040 PROCEDURE.
   The following procedure will be followed in applying for the Private Road
Surfacing Program:
   A.   The Township Highway Commissioner must be contacted in order to
determine the nature and extent of the roadway base, drainage, and right-of-way
improvements necessary to meet his requirements for accepting the road or
street in the township system. The Commissioner is the final authority for
determining these requirements with the approval of the County Engineer. IN NO
CASE SHALL THE MINIMUM STANDARDS OF THIS PROGRAM BE WAIVED.
   B.   Prior to March 1st of each year:
      1.   The residents adjacent to the roadway shall notify the County
Engineer, in writing, that the residents are planning to upgrade the road and
wish to participate in the County’s program to construct the bituminous
surface. A map shall be included identifying those roadways that are planned to
be upgraded.
         - or -
      2.   The township highway commissioner, shall, in writing, notify the
County Engineer that the road district in cooperation with the residents is
planning on accepting the roadway and upgrading it to meet the minimum
requirements of this program. A map shall be included identifying those
roadways that are planned to be upgraded.
   C.   Prior to May 1st of each year the County will determine, based on
funding limitations, which roadways of the requests submitted, will be paved in
the FOLLOWING YEAR. It is the County’s requirement that all roadway bases are
to be constructed and allowed to settle over one winter season before
construction of the bituminous surface. Therefore, normally when the base and
drainage work are completed and approved during a calendar year, the roads and
streets become eligible under the County’s program for the following calendar
year.
      1.   When requests for roadway surfacing exceed the funding budgeted for
the program, the following priority shall be used in determining which roadways
will be surfaced:
      2.   Roads that are upgraded to meet minimum County and Township
standards by the residents without the assistance of the Township.
      3.   Remaining roads will be ranked, and funded, in descending order
starting with those roadways that serve the largest number of dwelling units
per mile of road until funding is exhausted.
   D.   Upon approval of the request for funding by the County, the residents
(or township) shall perform, or cause to be performed, the necessary roadway,
drainage and right-of-way work to meet the requirements of the Township Highway
Commissioner and the County Highway Department. The County Engineer and the
Township Highway Commissioner must be contacted at the time the actual
construction is started so that proper inspections and quality control can be
monitored by the Township and the County.
   E.   When construction of the base, drainage, and right-of-way work has been
completed, obtain the approval of the Township Highway Commissioner and notify
the County Engineer, in writing, that the work has been completed and approved
by the Township Highway Commissioner. NOTE: All roadway base, drainage, and
right-of-way work must be completed by November 1st in order to remain eligible
for paving during the next year.
   F.   In those instances where right-of-way dedication is required, or the
acceptance by the township is necessary prior to assistance, the Township
Highway Commissioner must submit the necessary acceptance certifications and
right-of-way documentation to the County Engineer for approval by November 1st
of the year prior to paving.

ARTICLE IV. ALTERATION, CONSTRUCTION, DEMOLITION AND MAINTENANCE
§ 15.40.210 SCOPE.
   Work on property and improvements so designated pursuant to this chapter
shall be regulated as follows:
   A.   Landmarks. No significant alterations, exterior construction and/or
exterior demolition may be performed on property and structures which have been
designated under this chapter as landmarks or are in the process of being
nominated for landmark status, except as shall be approved by a “certificate of
appropriateness.”
   B.   Preservation Districts. No significant alterations, exterior
construction and/or exterior demolition may be performed on property and
structures which have been designated under this chapter as a preservation
district or are in the process of being nominated for a preservation district,
except as shall be approved by a “certificate of appropriateness.”
(Ord. O-9110-1200-49, Art. 4, § 1, passed 10-15-1991)
§ 15.40.220 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   A.   A “certificate of appropriateness” from the Commission established
pursuant to this chapter shall be required before any significant alteration,
construction, demolition or removal that affects pending or designated
landmarks and preservation districts is undertaken. Such a certificate is
required for all such actions from the date a nomination in proper form for
designation is submitted to the Commission.
   B.   Application for Certificates of Appropriateness. Every application
submitted to the McHenry County Building and Zoning Department, for a permit
wherein the applicant represents and/or delineates plans to commence any action
as described in subsection A. of this section affecting any such property,
improvements or areas therein described, shall be forwarded by the McHenry
County Zoning Enforcement Officer to a representative or representatives of the
Commission, within three days following the receipt of said application by the
McHenry County Building and Zoning Department. The McHenry County Building and
Zoning Department shall not issue a building or demolition permit until a
“certificate of appropriateness” has been issued by the Commission. Any
applicant may request a meeting with the Commission before the application is
sent by the McHenry County Zoning Enforcement Officer to the Commission or
during the review of the application.
      Application for review of construction, alteration, demolition or removal
not requiring a building permit but for which a “certificate of
appropriateness” is required shall be made on a form prepared by the Commission
and available at the McHenry County Department of Planning. The Commission may
schedule, provide notice and conduct a public hearing concerning the
application in the manner previously described in §§
15.40.110 and
15.40.120.
      If a public hearing is not scheduled, the Commission may consider the
completed application at its next regular meeting and may grant a “certificate
of appropriateness” at that time. The Commission may further request staff
support in reviewing and approving routine applications for “certificates of
appropriateness” when the proposed work is clearly appropriate and in
accordance with the criteria set forth in subsections C. and D. of this
section, and the purposes of this chapter.
      The Commission shall act promptly and in a reasonable manner in its
judgment of plans for new construction for alteration, removal or demolition of
structures in preservation districts that have little historic value and that
are not shown on priority lists, except where such construction, alteration or
demolition would seriously impair the historic or architectural value of
surrounding structures or the surrounding area.
   C.   Design Guidelines. The Commission shall consider the following factors
in reviewing applications for “certificates of appropriateness”:
      1.   Height: compatible with the style and character of the landmark and
with surrounding structures within a preservation district;
      2.   Proportions of windows and doors: compatible with the architectural
style and character of the landmark and with the surrounding structures within
a preservation district;
      3.   Relationship of building masses and spaces: compatible within a
preservation district to open space between it and adjoining structures;
      4.   Roof shape: compatible with the architectural style and character of
the landmark and surrounding structures in a preservation district;
      5.   Landscaping: compatible with the architectural style and character
of the landmark and surrounding structures in a preservation district;
      6.   Scale: compatible with the architectural style and character of the
landmark and surrounding structures in a preservation district;
      7.   Directional expression: compatible with the dominant horizontal or
vertical expression of surrounding structures and facades;
      8.   Architectural Details: treated to make a landmark compatible with
its original architectural style or character.
   D.   Standards for Review. The Commission in considering the appropriateness
of any alteration, demolition, new construction, removal of any property or
structures designated, or pending designation, as a landmark, or any area
designated, or pending designation as a preservation district, shall be guided
by the following general standards in addition to any design guidelines in the
ordinance designating the landmark or preservation district, as well as
conformance to applicable zoning classification, height and area limitation:
      1.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      2.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should
be avoided when possible.
      3.   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      4.   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      6.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      7.   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      8.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
      9.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alteration and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
      10.   Wherever possible new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   E.   Determination by Commission. Within fifteen (15) days (Saturdays,
Sundays and legal holidays excluded) after support staff review, or from the
date of the regular meeting, or from the close of a public hearing concerning
an application for a “certificate of appropriateness,” or within such further
time as the applicant for said certificate (and/or permit) approves in writing,
the Commission shall determine whether:
      1.   The proposed construction, removal or other modification will be
appropriate to the preservation of the particular landmark or preservation
district and a “certificate of appropriateness” may be issued; or
      2.   Such proposed modification is inappropriate to the preservation of
the particular landmark or preservation district and a “certificate of
appropriateness” may be denied.
   Written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a
“certificate of appropriateness” shall be provided the applicant, sent by
certified mail with return receipt requested, and to McHenry County Planning
Department within seven days (Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays excluded)
following the determination and shall be accompanied by a “certificate of
appropriateness” in the case of approval.
   F.   Denial of “Certificate of Appropriateness.” A denial of a “certificate
of appropriateness” shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the
denial. The Commission shall make recommendations to the applicant concerning
changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the Commission to
reconsider its denial and shall confer with the applicant and attempt to
resolve as quickly as possible the difference(s) between the applicant and the
Commission. The applicant may resubmit an amended application or reapply for a
building or demolition permit that takes into consideration the recommendations
of the Commission.
   G.   Decision Binding on Zoning Enforcement Officer. The McHenry County
Zoning Enforcement Officer, shall be bound by the determination of the
Commission and approve, if in conformance with other provisions of the building
code, or disapprove any application for the proposed construction, alteration,
removal of an exterior architectural feature, or demolition of any building or
structure, in a preservation district or any landmark in accordance with said
determination.
   H.   Failure of Commission to Review Application in a Timely Manner. Failure
of the Commission to act upon an application for “certificate of
appropriateness” within ninety (90) days shall constitute approval and no other
evidence shall be needed. This time limit may be waived only by mutual consent
of the applicant and the Commission.
   I.   Demolitions. Pursuant to subsections C. and D. of this section, the
Commission may deny any application for a “certificate of appropriateness”
where demolition is proposed upon a finding that such proposed action will
adversely affect the historic, archaeological, architectural or scenic
significance of a landmark or preservation district. Upon receipt of an
application for a “certificate of appropriateness” for demolition, the
Commission shall as soon as possible make a determination, supported by written
findings, whether one or more of the following criteria are met:
      1.   The structure, located within a preservation district, is of such
interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state or local
criteria for designation as an historic or architectural landmark on its own
credentials.
      2.   The structure is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or
materials that it could not be reproduced, or be reproduced only with great
difficulty and expense.
      3.   Retention of the structure would aid substantially, in preserving
and protecting another structure which meets the criteria of subsection I.1. or
2. of this section.
   Where the Commission determines that one or more of these criteria are met,
no “certificate of appropriateness” shall be issued and the application shall
be denied.
   Additionally, the Commission shall require the applicant to submit for
review and consideration post-demolition plans, to include drawings or sketches
with sufficient detail to show, as far as they relate to exterior appearance,
the architectural design of any and all improvements incorporated in such
plans.
   J.   Compliance with Certificate. A “certificate of appropriateness” will
become void:
      1.   If there is any change in the scope of work pursuant to the approved
application subsequent to the issuance of the certificate; or
      2.   If twelve (12) months have elapsed after the issuance of the
certificate and no building permit has been issued or if twenty-four (24)
months have lapsed after issuance of the last building permit and the project
has not been completed.
   K.   Appeals. A denial of a “certificate of appropriateness” is an
administrative decision as defined in § 3-101 of the Administrative Review Law,
and it shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to provision of said
Administrative Review Law and all amendments and modifications thereof, and the
rules adopted thereto.
(Ord. O-9110-1200-49, Art. 4, § 2, passed 10-15-1991)

property as a result of the denial of the “certificate of appropriateness”;
      5.   In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from a licensed
architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate

      13.   Any other information, including the income tax bracket of the
owner, applicant or principal investors in the property considered necessary by
the Commission to make a determination as to whether the property does yield or
may yield a reasonable return to owners.
   C.   Determination of Economic Hardship. Within one hundred twenty (120)
days from receiving a request for a “certificate of economic hardship,” the
Commission, upon a determination that the denial of a “certificate of

structure, in whole or in part, shall be constructed, moved, enlarged or
structurally altered in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   C.   Private Agreements. This Ordinance is not intended to nullify any

§ 16.04.040 TRANSITION RULES.
   In determining the applicability of this Ordinance, with respect to the
previously applicable zoning regulations, the following rules apply.
   A.   Existing Unlawful Structures and Uses. A structure or use that is
unlawful at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, but is made legal by
the provisions of this Ordinance, is deemed lawful as of the effective date of
this Ordinance. However, if such structure or use does not conform with every
requirement of this Ordinance, then that structure or use remains unlawful.
   B.   Existing Uses.
      1.   If property is used in a manner that was classified as a permitted
use prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and that use is now
classified as a conditional use as of the effective date of this Ordinance, it
is deemed a nonconforming use. Such uses are allowed to continue and are
controlled by the provisions of
Chapter 16.80 (Nonconformities). However, any addition, enlargement, or
expansion of the use is required to obtain a conditional use permit prior to
the addition, enlargement, or expansion.
      2.   If property is used in a manner that was classified as a conditional
use prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and that use is now
classified as a permitted use as of the effective date of this Ordinance, that
use is deemed a lawful permitted use. However, any subsequent addition,
enlargement, or expansion of that use is required to conform to any Ordinance
requirements for such permitted use.
   C.   Uses Rendered Nonconforming. If property is used in a manner that was a
lawful use prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or if the property
owner can document to the satisfaction of the Zoning Enforcement Officer that
an agricultural, single- or two-family residential, or residential accessory
use existed prior to March 1, 2005, regardless of if such agricultural, single-
or two-family residential, or residential accessory use was lawful at the time
of establishment, and this Ordinance no longer classifies that use as either a
permitted or conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located,
that use is deemed a legal nonconforming use and is controlled by the
provisions of
Chapter 16.80 (Nonconformities).
   D.   Structures Rendered Nonconforming. If an existing structure conformed
to the standards of this Ordinance prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, or if the property owner can document to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Enforcement Officer that an agricultural, single- or two-family
residential, or residential accessory structure existed prior to March 1, 2005,
regardless of if such agricultural, single- or two-family residential, or
residential accessory structure conformed to standards of this Ordinance at the
time of construction, and such structure does not meet all standards set forth
in this Ordinance, that structure is deemed a legal nonconforming structure and
is controlled by the provisions of
Chapter 16.80 (Nonconformities).
   E.   Previously Issued or Pending Building Permits. If a building permit has
been applied for or issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, the
permit shall be issued and construction may occur in accordance with the
permit. The structure may be nonconforming under this Ordinance.
   F.   Previously Granted Conditional Use Permits and Variations.
      1.   All conditional use permits and variations granted prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance remain in full force and effect. The recipient
of the conditional use permit or variation may proceed to develop the property
in accordance with the approved plans and any applicable conditions. However,
if the recipient has failed to act on the conditional use permit or variation
before the approval expires, including any periods of extension granted, the
provisions of this Ordinance control.
      2.   Subject to §
16.16.050H. (Expiration of Approved Conditional Use Permits), conditional use
permits granted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance may be renewed
regardless if the use is prohibited under §
16.32.060 (Zoning District Uses) and
Table 16.32-1. Applications pursuant to this section may include requests for
an expansion of the conditional use, or an amendment to the limiting conditions
of the conditional use. Nothing in this section shall prevent the County from
denying a conditional use renewal, expansion, or amendment submitted pursuant
to this section.
      3.   If the application of the use standards of this Ordinance for the
renewal application will result in an unreasonable hardship to the applicant,
the use standards of this Ordinance shall not be a basis for denial. If the
hardship is caused by an expansion or amendment of the conditional use being
renewed, it can be denied for failure to comply with the use standards in this
Ordinance.
   G.   Pending Zoning Applications. If a zoning application for a rezoning or
conditional use permit has been applied for prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, the application may continue under the ordinance in effect at the
time of application. The use or structure may be nonconforming under this
Ordinance.
   H.   Pending Subdivision Applications. If a subdivision application has been
applied for prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, the application may
continue under the ordinance in effect at the time of application.
   I.   Continuation of Previous Enforcement Actions. Nothing in this Ordinance
shall prohibit the continuation of previous enforcement actions, undertaken by
the County, pursuant to previous and valid ordinances and laws.

§ 16.04.050 SEVERABILITY.
   A.   If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision
of this Ordinance is adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, that judgment does not affect, impair, invalidate, or nullify the
remainder of this Ordinance. The effect of the judgment is confined to the
section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision immediately
involved in the controversy in which judgment or decree was rendered.
   B.   If any court of competent jurisdiction rules invalid the application of
any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence or provision of this
Ordinance to a particular property, structure, or use, that ruling shall not
affect the application of the ordinance provisions to any property, structure,
or use not specifically included in the judgment.

§ 16.16.020 APPLICATION.
Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new legislation (Ord. O-
202208-ZBA-031, passed 8-16-2022). The text of the amendment will be
incorporated below when the amending legislation is codified.
   A.   Authorization.
      1.   A zoning application for a zoning variation, administrative
variation, conditional use permit, site plan review, sign permit, temporary use
permit, or zoning appeal may be filed by a property owner or other person
expressly authorized by the owner in writing. A zoning application for a zoning
interpretation or a zoning text or map amendment may be filed by a property
owner, or other person expressly authorized by the owner, in a notarized letter
of authorization, or by the Planning and Development Committee.
      2.   All applications, except applications initiated by the Planning and
Development Committee, shall be brought in the name of the record title owner
or the owner(s) of the beneficial interest through authorized agents. If a
contract purchaser or tenant is involved, either with or without a contingent
right, the contract purchaser or tenant shall be revealed and become a second
party to the petition. Such contract purchaser or tenant may not file without
the owner.
      3.   If application is made by the trustee or beneficiary of any land
trust for any zoning map amendment, variation, or conditional use permit, the
application and notice shall identify each beneficiary of such land trust by
name and address and define his/her interest. All applications shall be
verified by the applicant in the applicant’s capacity as trustee or by the
beneficiary(s) as a beneficial owner(s) of an interest in such land trust.
      4.   If application is made by a corporation or partnership for any
zoning map amendment, variation, or conditional use permit, the application and
notice shall identify the names and addresses of all officers and directors and
all shareholders/stockholders owning an interest in excess of seven and one-
half percent (7.5%).
      5.   For the purposes of this Ordinance, a property owner must
demonstrate that the jurisdictional requirements of §
16.04.030A. (Territorial Application) are met.
   B.   Filing.
      1.   All applications shall be filed with the Department of Planning and
Development.
      2.   The application shall be on forms provided by the County and filed
in the number of copies that the instructions require. If not specifically
described within the form, all required plans shall be at a scale sufficient to
permit a clear understanding of the proposal.
   C.   Completeness.
      1.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer will determine whether the
application is complete. The Department of Planning and Development will notify
the applicant that the application is complete or inform the applicant of any
deficiencies. The Department of Planning and Development will take no steps to
process the application until all deficiencies are remedied. An application
that has been deemed incomplete or inactive for a period of not less than one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of last correspondence from applicant
may be cancelled upon written thirty (30) day notice, delivered by certified
mail, to the applicant.
      2.   Once the application is determined to be complete, the application
will be scheduled for consideration by the appropriate board, commission, or
official. However, the appropriate board, commission, or official may also
require the applicant to supplement the application with additional
information.
   D.   Fees. Every application shall be accompanied by the required filing
fee, as established by the County. The applicant is responsible for additional
fees including, but not limited to, publication fees, court recorder fees,
mailing fees, Natural Inventory Report fees, and Endangered Species
Consultation (EcoCAT) Report fees. Applications will not be forwarded to the
next stage in the approval process until all fees due are paid.
   E.   Amendments to Applications. Amendments to any complete application are
only allowed upon approval of a petition to amend. The petition to amend shall
be filed with Department of Planning and Development and decided by the body
conducting the public hearing if the hearing has not yet been closed. If the
hearing on the application has been closed, the petition to amend the
application shall be filed with the McHenry County Clerk and decided upon by
the County Board. If approved by the County Board, the body conducting the
public hearing shall conduct a new public hearing and consider only evidence
pertaining to the application amendment. The petitioner is responsible for the
payment of fees for this new hearing and all notice requirements for a public
hearing.
   F.   Withdrawal of Application. An applicant has the right to withdraw an
application at any time prior to the decision on the application by a board,
commission, or official. Requests for withdrawal shall be submitted in writing
by the applicant.
   G.   Successive Applications.
      1.   Within one (1) year of the date of denial by the County Board, a
subsequent application will not be reviewed or heard unless there is
substantial new evidence available, or if a significant mistake of law or of
fact affected the prior denial.
      2.   If the application is resubmitted earlier than one (1) year from the
date of denial, the subsequent application shall include a detailed statement
of the grounds justifying its consideration.
      3.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer will make a determination as to
whether the subsequent application is appropriate for resubmittal prior to the
expiration of the one (1) year wait requirement. If the Zoning Enforcement
Officer finds that there are no new grounds for consideration of the subsequent
application, the request may summarily, and without hearing, be denied.

§ 16.20.010 ZONING MAP AND TEXT AMENDMENT.
   A.   Purpose. The regulations imposed and the districts created by this
Ordinance may be amended from time to time in accordance with this section.
This process for amending the text or the map is intended to permit
modifications in response to changed conditions or changes in County policy.
   B.   Initiation. A zoning application for a zoning text or map amendment may
be filed by a property owner, or other person expressly authorized by the
owner, in a notarized letter of authorization, or by the Planning and
Development Committee.
   C.   Authority. The County Board, after receiving a recommendation from the
Zoning Board of Appeals, will take formal action on requests for zoning text or
map amendments. Zoning text amendments can be applied for only in relation to
the zoning standards of this Ordinance, including signs. Standards for
subdivisions do not require the zoning text amendment process for changes.
Chapter 16.24 (Subdivision Applications) and
Chapter 16.76 (Subdivision Standards) can be amended directly by the County
Board.
   D.   Procedure. All applications are filed with the Department of Planning
and Development in accordance with the requirements of §
16.16.020 (Application). Once it is determined that the application is
complete, the Department of Planning and Development will schedule the
application for consideration by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Amendments
initiated by the County also require an application.
      1.   Action by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
         a.   The Zoning Board of Appeals will conduct a public hearing on a
proposed zoning amendment in accordance with §
16.16.040 (Public Hearing) within ninety (90) calendar days after receipt of a
complete application. Notice for the public hearing shall be in accordance with
§
16.16.030 (Notice).
         b.   The Zoning Board of Appeals will evaluate the application, based
upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to each of the
applicable standards in subsection E. below (Approval Standards for Zoning
Amendments). For zoning text amendments, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
recommend approval, modified approval, or denial of the application. For zoning
map amendments, the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend approval or denial of
the application.
         c.   The Department of Planning and Development shall prepare and
submit an ordinance to the County Board for the next available meeting in
accordance with the County Board rules.
      2.   Action by the County Board. 
         a.   The County Board will consider the application upon receiving the
Zoning Board of Appeals recommendation. However, the County Board shall not act
on a map amendment until thirty (30) calendar days following the close of the
public hearing. The County Board shall take action in the form of approval or
denial on applications for zoning text and map amendments. The County Board
shall take action within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the close of
the public hearing, unless an extension of time has been authorized by the
County Board prior to the expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) calendar
day timeframe. If the County Board does not act within the one hundred eighty
(180) calendar day timeframe, plus any authorized extension of time, the
application is deemed denied.
         b.   A majority vote of all the members of the County Board is
required to pass a zoning text or zoning map amendment, unless any of the
following conditions apply:
            (1)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the members of
the County Board is required to pass a zoning map amendment if a written
protest signed by the owner(s) of at least twenty percent (20%) of the land to
be rezoned is filed with the County Clerk.
            (2)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the members of
the County Board is required to pass a zoning map amendment if a written
protest signed by the owner(s) of land contiguous to or located directly across
a public right-of-way from at least twenty percent (20%) of the perimeter of
the land to be rezoned is filed with the County Clerk.
            (3)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the members of
the County Board is required to pass a zoning map amendment if the land
affected by a proposed amendment lies within one and one-half (1½) miles of the
limits of a zoned municipality and a resolution objecting to the amendment is
passed by the municipal board/council and filed with the McHenry County Clerk.
            (4)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the members of
the County Board is required to pass a zoning map amendment or a text amendment
if a township plan commission objects to a map amendment or a text amendment
affecting an unincorporated area of the township and the township board of
trustees submits its written objection to the County Board. The letter of
objection shall be delivered to the County Board chairman with a copy sent to
the Zoning Enforcement Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of
the Zoning Board of Appeals public hearing.
            (5)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the members of
the County Board is required to pass a zoning text amendment if a written
protest against the proposed text amendment is signed by five percent (5%) of
property owners in the County and filed with the McHenry County Clerk.
            A copy of the written protest or objection must be served by the
protestor or objector on the applicant for the proposed amendment and a copy on
the applicant’s attorney, if any, by certified mail at the address of the
applicant and attorney shown in the zoning application and the proof of
delivery shall be filed with the McHenry County Clerk prior to the County Board
meeting where the zoning map or text amendment is to be considered.
   E.   Approval Standards for Zoning Amendments. The Zoning Board of Appeals
recommendation and the County Board decision shall consider the following
standards. However, the Zoning Board of Appeals’ recommendation and the County
Board’s decision on any zoning text or map amendment is not controlled by any
one factor under the following standards, but rather the approval of amendments
is based on a balancing of the factors under each standard.
      1.   Approval Standards for Map Amendments.
         a.   The compatibility of the proposed zoning with the existing use
and zoning of nearby property.
         b.   The extent to which property values of the subject property are
diminished by the existing zoning.
         c.   The extent to which the public health, safety, and welfare of the
public are promoted by the existing zoning.
         d.   The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship
imposed upon the applicant, if the proposed zoning is denied.
         e.   The suitability of the property for the purposes for which it is
presently zoned.
         f.   The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned
considered in the context of land development in the vicinity of the subject
property.
         g.   The community need for the proposed use.
         h.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the adopted
comprehensive plan and the appropriateness of the comprehensive plan to the
subject property.
      2.   Approval Standards for Text Amendments.
         a.   The extent to which the proposed amendment promotes the public
health, safety, and welfare.
         b.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purpose and
general regulations of this Ordinance.
         c.   Whether the proposed amendment corrects an error or omission,
adds clarification to existing requirements, or reflects a change in policy or
conditions.
         d.   The extent to which the proposed amendment creates
nonconformities.
   F.   Limitations on Denials. No application for an amendment which has been
denied by the County Board may be resubmitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for a period of one (1) year from that date of denial, except as described in §
16.16.020G. (Successive Applications).

§ 16.20.020 VARIATION.
   A.   Purpose. The variation process is to provide a narrowly circumscribed
means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this
Ordinance that create practical difficulties or particular hardships.
Variations for wireless telecommunications standards are processed according to
§
16.20.030 (Variation To Wireless Telecommunications Standards).
   B.   Initiation. A property owner in the County, or person expressly
authorized by the owner in writing, may request a variation for that property.
   C.   Applicability of Zoning and Administrative Variations. This Ordinance
allows for two (2) types of variations. An administrative variation may be
approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and a zoning variation may only be
approved by the County Board in accordance with the procedures of this section.
Variations for wireless telecommunications standards are processed according to
§
16.20.030 (Variation To Wireless Telecommunications Standards).
   D.   Authority. Variations are authorized by the terms of this Ordinance.
Zoning variations are authorized by the County Board. The Zoning Enforcement
Officer is authorized to grant certain administrative variances. Variations can
be applied for only in relation to the zoning standards of this Ordinance,
which includes sign regulations. Exemptions to standards for subdivisions are
subject to the process contained in §
16.24.050 (Exemptions from Subdivision Standards).
   E.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. All applications shall be filed with the Department of
Planning and Development in accordance with the requirements in §
16.16.020 (Application).
      2.   Administrative Variation. The Zoning Enforcement Officer will review
and approve applications that meet the following standards:
         a.   Variation applications of ten percent (10%) or less of the bulk
or setback regulations for principal structures, accessory structures, or
signs. Encroachments allowed under Table 16.20-1: Permitted Encroachments are
ineligible for administrative variation. All other variations are considered
zoning variations.
         b.   No written objections have been received. If any noticed property
owner files a written objection to the administrative variation within fifteen
(15) calendar days of receipt of such notice, the variation shall be denied.
The property owner may apply for a Zoning Variation to be considered by the
Hearing Officer or Zoning Board of Appeals.
      3.   Zoning Variation.
         a.   Applications for zoning variations that are filed in conjunction
with an application of a conditional use permit or zoning map amendment shall
be considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals simultaneously with the
conditional use permit or zoning map amendment. Applications for zoning
variations that are not filed in conjunction with an application for a
conditional use permit or zoning map amendment shall be considered by the
Hearing Officer. Such applications may be considered by the Zoning Board of
Appeals only in the event that the Hearing Officer is unavailable.
         b.   The Zoning Board of Appeals or Hearing Officer will then conduct
a public hearing on a zoning variation application in accordance with §
16.16.040 (Public Hearing). Notice for the public hearing shall be in
accordance with §
16.16.030 (Notice).
         c.   The Zoning Board of Appeals or Hearing Officer will evaluate the
application, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant
to the applicable standards in subsection F. below (Approval Standards for
Zoning Variations).
         d.   The Zoning Board of Appeals or Hearing Officer will recommend
approval, modified approval or denial of the application within ninety (90)
calendar days of receipt of the complete application.
         e.   Following the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals or
Hearing Officer, the Department of Planning and Development shall prepare an
ordinance incorporating the findings and recommendations of Zoning Board of
Appeals or Hearing Officer.
         f.   The Department of Planning and Development shall submit the
ordinance and Zoning Board of Appeals or Hearing Officer recommendation to the
County Board for the next available meeting in accordance with the County Board
rules. The applicant shall pay all outstanding fees prior to the ordinance’s
submittal to the County Board.
         g.   Action by the County Board.
            (1)   The County Board shall take action within one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days of the close of the public hearing, unless an extension of
time has been authorized by the County Board prior to the expiration of the one
hundred eighty (180) calendar day timeframe. The County Board may take action
in the form of approval, modified approval, or denial. If the County Board does
not act within the one hundred eighty (180) calendar day timeframe, plus any
authorized extension of time, the application is deemed denied.
            (2)   A simple majority vote of the members of the County Board
present at a meeting is required to pass a variation, unless any of the
following conditions apply:
               (a)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the County
Board members is required to pass a variation if the Hearing Officer
recommended denial of the variation.
               (b)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the County
Board members is required to pass a variation if the variation requested did
not receive five favorable votes from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
               (c)   A favorable vote of three-fourths (¾) of all the County
Board members is required to pass a variation if the township plan commission
objects to the variation and the township board of trustees submits a written
objection to the County Board. The letter of objection must be signed by a
majority of the township trustees and shall be delivered to the County Board
via the County Board chairman with a copy sent to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer within fifteen (15) days after the close of the public hearing.
      4.   Conditions and Restrictions. The Zoning Board of Appeals or Hearing
Officer may recommend and the County Board may impose conditions and
restrictions upon the location, construction, design, and use of the property
seeking a zoning variation that are necessary to protect the public interest
and adjacent property. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions
constitutes grounds for revocation of the variation. The terms of relief
granted, including any conditions or restrictions, shall be specifically set
forth in the recommendation and approval.
   F.   Approval Standards for Zoning Variations. No zoning variation from the
provisions of this Ordinance may be granted unless the Zoning Board of Appeals
or Hearing Officer and County Board makes specific findings that the request
meets each of the standards imposed by this section. These standards are as
follows:
      1.   The particular surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of
the specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the
owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulations was carried out.
      2.   The conditions upon which the application for a variation are based
are unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
generally applicable to other property within the same zoning district.
      3.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase the monetary gain realized from the property.
      4.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the Ordinance and
has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the
property.
      5.   That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
      6.   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent
neighborhood.
      7.   That the granting of the variation requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other land
or structure of the same zoning district.
   G.   Variation Less Than Requested. A variation less than that requested may
be granted when the record supports the applicant’s right to some relief, but
not to the entire relief requested.
   H.   Revocation of Variation.
      1.   Any approved variation shall be null and void if a building permit
is not obtained or any structure not requiring a building permit is not erected
within one (1) year from the date of approval.
      2.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may grant one (1) extension of this
period, valid for no more than one hundred eighty (180) additional calendar
days, upon written application and with good cause shown, without notice or
hearing.
   I.   Limitations on Denials. No application for a variation, which has been
denied, may be resubmitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer, Zoning Board of
Appeals, or Hearing Officer for a period of one (1) year from that date of
denial, except as described in §
16.16.020G. (Successive Applications).

§ 16.20.030 VARIATION TO WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS.
   A.   Granting of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities Variations. The
County Board may grant variations for any of the regulations, conditions, and
restrictions of this section after one (1) public hearing on the proposed
variation, by a favorable vote of a simple majority of the members present at a
meeting held no later than seventy-five (75) calendar days after submission of
an application by the telecommunications carrier. If the County Board fails to
act on the application within seventy-five (75) calendar days after submission,
the application is deemed approved. The variation standards and process in this
section are required in place of the variation provisions of §
16.20.020 (Variation). Modifications to wireless telecommunications facilities
by an amount less than what is defined as a “substantial change” by the Federal
Communications Commission under 47 CFR 1.40001 (Wireless Facility
Modifications) do not require a variation.
   B.   Telecommunications Facilities Variation Applications.
      1.   Application for a variation shall be filed with the Hearing Officer
appointed by the County Board, using forms available from that officer. A
hearing date for a variation will be set by the Hearing Officer when all of the
filing requirements of this Ordinance have been met. The Hearing Officer will
not consider the sufficiency of the application and evidence until after a
public hearing has been held and all parties have been given an opportunity to
address such application, evidence, and documents. After said hearing, the
Hearing Officer will make a finding as to the sufficiency of the application,
evidence, documents, and testimony and report this finding in the
recommendation to the County Board.
      2.   Applications shall contain at a minimum, the nature of the request,
a legal description, permanent parcel number and common description of the
property, a statement of the present zoning of the subject property and
surrounding properties, the current address of the petitioners, and a
verification by the owners or their authorized agent attesting to the truth and
correctness of all facts, statements, and information presented. In addition,
applications for variations shall contain a survey of the property by a
surveyor registered in the State of Illinois, including the location of the
proposed tower. The legal description in the survey shall coincide with the
legal description on the petition, legal notices, and ordinance, when
presented.
      3.   All petitions shall be brought in the name of the record title
owner, or the owner or owners of the beneficial interest, through their
attorneys or authorized agents. If a contract purchaser or tenant is involved,
either with or without a contingent right, the contract purchaser or tenant
shall be revealed and become a second party to the petition, but such contract
purchaser or tenant may not file without owner.
      4.   If application is made by the trustee or beneficiary of any land
trust for a variation, the application and notice shall identify each
beneficiary of such land trust by name and address and define his interest
therein. All such applications shall be verified by the applicant in the
applicant’s capacity as trustee or by the beneficiary(s) as beneficial owner(s)
of an interest in such land trust.
   C.   Telecommunications Facilities Variation Standards. In considering an
application for a variation, the Hearing Officer and County Board will consider
the following, and no other matters:
      1.   Whether, but for the granting of a variation, the service that the
telecommunications carrier seeks to enhance or provide with the proposed
facility will be less available, impaired or diminished in quality, quantity,
or scope of coverage.
      2.   Whether the conditions upon which the application for variations is
based are unique in some respect or, if not, whether the strict application of
the regulations would result in a hardship on the telecommunications carrier.
      3.   Whether a substantial adverse effect on public safety will result
from some aspect of the facility’s design or proposed construction, but only if
that aspect of design or construction is modifiable by the applicant.
      4.   Whether there are benefits to be derived by the users of the
services to be provided or enhanced by the facility and whether public safety
and emergency response capabilities would benefit by the establishment of the
facility.
      5.   The extent to which the design of the proposed facility reflects
compliance with this Ordinance.
   D.   Telecommunications Facilities Variation Notice of Hearing. Notice of
public hearing shall be published at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the County by the
applicant and sent by certified mail at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing to the owners of record of all property that is adjacent to the lot
upon which the facility is proposed to be sited by the applicant. The notice
shall contain:
      1.   The particular location of the real estate for which the variation
is requested by legal description; street address, or, if no street address
exists, then by locating such real estate with reference to any well-known
landmark, highway, road, thoroughfare, or intersection; permanent property
index number; and township name.
      2.   Whether the petitioner or applicant is acting for himself or in the
capacity of an agent, alter ego, or representative of a owner and stating the
name and address of the actual and true owner.
      3.   Whether petitioner or applicant is a corporation, and if a
corporation, the correct names and addresses of all officers and directors, and
of all stockholders and shareholders owning any interest in excess of seven and
one-half percent (7.5%) of all outstanding stock of such corporation.
      4.   Whether the petitioner or applicant or his owner, if other than
applicant, is a business or entity doing business under any assumed name, and
if so, the name and residence of all true and actual owners of such business or
entity.
      5.   Whether the petitioner or applicant is a partnership, joint venture,
syndicate, or an unincorporated voluntary association, and if so, the names and
addresses of all partners, joint ventures, syndicate members, or members of the
unincorporated voluntary association.
      6.   A statement of the present zoning on the parcel in question.
      7.   A brief statement of the proposed variation.
      8.   The time, date, and location of the hearing.
   E.   Hearing Process. The following additional requirements apply to the
public hearing held on an application to the wireless telecommunications
standards:
      1.   A hearing shall be held on any proposed variation in the County
Government Center.
      2.   No more than one (1) public hearing will be held or required.
      3.   Filing fees for variation hearings are in accordance with the fee
schedule adopted by the County Board and shall cover all costs.
      4.   The public hearing will be conducted by the Hearing Officer in the
manner established by the Hearing Officer.
      5.   A detailed record of the proceedings shall be taken by a court
reporter present at the hearing to transcribe the testimony.
      6.   The recommendation of the Hearing Officer to the County Board shall
be supported by written findings of fact upon each of the authorized matters
for consideration.
      7.   Action by the County Board.
         a.   Variations may be granted by the County Board upon receipt of a
report and recommendation from the Hearing Officer, by a favorable vote of a
simple majority of the members present at a meeting held no later than seventy-
five (75) calendar days after submission of an application.
         b.   Failure of the County Board to act on the application within
seventy-five (75) calendar days after submission will deem the application
approved.

§ 16.20.040 CONDITIONAL USE.
   A.   Purpose. This Ordinance divides the County into zoning districts,
where, within each district, the use of land and structures are substantially
uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses that, because
of their unique characteristics, require individual consideration of the
appropriateness of that use at a particular location.
   B.   Initiation. A property owner or other person expressly authorized by
the owner in writing may file an application to use such land for one (1) or
more of the conditional uses provided for in this Ordinance within the zoning
district in which the land is situated or to amend an existing conditional use
permit.
   C.   Authority. The County Board, after receiving a recommendation from the
Zoning Board of Appeals, will take formal action on conditional use permit
applications.
   D.   Procedure. Applications for a conditional use permits are filed with
the Department of Planning and Development. All applications for a conditional
use permits shall be filed in accordance with the requirements in §
16.16.020 (Application). Once it is determined that the application is
complete, the Department of Planning and Development will schedule the
application for consideration by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      1.   Action by the Staff Plat Review Committee. All conditional use
permits require a site plan. The site plan shall be submitted, reviewed, and
approved by the Staff Plat Review Committee in accordance with this §
16.20.040 (Conditional Use) prior to final action by the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
      2.   Action by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
         a.   The Zoning Board of Appeals will conduct a public hearing on a
proposed conditional use in accordance with §
16.16.040 (Public Hearing) within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after
receipt of a complete application. In the case of applications for COMMERCIAL
SOLAR ENERGY FACILITY and COMMERCIAL WIND ENERGY FACILITY the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall conduct the public hearing within forty-five (45) calendar days
of the filing of the application. Notice for the public hearing shall be in
accordance with §
16.16.030 (Notice).
         b.   The Zoning Board of Appeals will evaluate the application, based
upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to the applicable
standards in subsection E. below (Approval Standards for Conditional Use
Permits).
         c.   The Zoning Board of Appeals will recommend approval or denial of
the application. The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend conditions and
restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and
operation of the conditional use as deemed necessary for the protection of the
public interest consistent with 55 ILCS 5/5-12020 as may be amended from time
to time.
         d.   Following the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, the
Department of Planning and Development shall prepare an ordinance incorporating
the findings and recommendations of Zoning Board of Appeals.
         e.   The Department of Planning and Development shall submit the
ordinance and Zoning Board of Appeals recommendation to the County Board for
the next available meeting in accordance with the County Board rules. The
applicant shall pay all outstanding fees prior to the recommendation’s
submittal to the County Board.
      3.   Action by the County Board.
         a.   The County Board shall take action within one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days of the close of the public hearing, unless an extension of
time has been authorized by the County Board prior to the expiration of the one
hundred eighty (180) calendar day timeframe. In the case of applications for
COMMERCIAL SOLAR ENERGY FACILITY and COMMERCIAL WIND ENERGY FACILITY, the
County Board shall act within thirty (30) calendar days. The County Board may
take action in the form of approval or denial. If the County Board does not act
with the one hundred eighty (180) calendar day timeframe, plus any authorized
extension of time, the application is deemed denied.
         b.   In granting any conditional use permit, the County Board may
impose conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance, and operation of the conditional use as deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest consistent with 55 ILCS 5/
5-12020 as may be amended from time to time. The County Board may require such
documentation and guarantees, as it deems necessary, to ensure compliance with
stipulated conditions.   
         c.   A simple majority vote of the members of the County Board present
at a meeting is required to pass a conditional use permit.
   E.   Approval Standards for Conditional Use Permits. No conditional use
permit may be granted unless the Zoning Board of Appeals and County Board makes
specific written findings that the request meets each of the standards imposed
by this section. These standards are as follows:
      1.   That the petitioner has demonstrated the ability to meet any
applicable standards contained in
Chapters 16.56 (Use Standards) and
16.60 (Site Development Standards).
      2.   That the site shall be so situated that the proposed use is
compatible with the existing or planned future development of the area.
      3.   That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional
use shall not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare of the neighboring vicinity.
      4.   That the conditional use shall not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted.
      5.   That the conditional use shall not substantially diminish and impair
property value within the neighborhood.
      6.   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      7.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion and hazard on public
streets.
      8.   That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to
the applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
      9.   That the conditional use is reasonably in the interest of the public
welfare.
      10.   That adequate measures will be taken to provide protection to
groundwater recharge and groundwater quality.
   F.   No Presumption of Approval. The listing of a use as a conditional use
within a zoning district in
Table 16.32-1: Zoning District Uses does not constitute an assurance or
presumption that such conditional use will be approved. Rather, each proposed
conditional use shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to all
applicable standards of this Ordinance. Such evaluation will determine whether
approval of the conditional use is appropriate at the particular location and
in the particular manner proposed.
   G.   Establishment of Conditional Use. No conditional use may be initiated
or continued on any property until all conditions and all County permit
requirements for the permitted conditional use and structures required for the
conditional use are met.
   H.   Expiration of Approved Conditional Use Permits. Conditional use permits
are valid for a period of ten (10) years, unless otherwise limited or permitted
as part of the County Board approval. Any application for renewal of a
conditional use permit must be filed before the expiration of such timeframe.
In addition, subject to verification by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, a
conditional use permit will expire under the following conditions. To re-
establish the conditional use permit, a new application is required.
      1.   For conditional uses approved to occur within a structure yet to be
constructed, the conditional use permit approval expires within two (2) years
following the date of conditional use permit approval if a building permit has
not been issued and construction has not commenced.
      2.   For conditional uses approved to occur within an existing structure
that shall be modified to meet the applicable building code standard for the
approved use, the conditional use permit approval expires within two (2) years
following the date of conditional use permit approval if a building permit has
not been issued and construction has not commenced.
      3.   For conditional uses approved to occur within existing structures
which require no building modifications or for a parcel of land where no
structure is planned, if the use is not established within one (1) year
following the date of conditional use permit approval, the conditional use
permit expires.
      4.   If a conditional use is discontinued for a continuous period of one
(1) year, the conditional use permit will expire. When the conditional use
granted is seasonal in nature and a disruption is due to the growing season or
an act of God, such period is exempt from the calculation of discontinuation.
In the case of an act of God, the property owner shall submit a written
statement to the Zoning Enforcement Officer documenting the cause of the
disruption.
      5.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may extend any above time limit set
forth in items 1-4 above if the following conditions are applicable:
         a.   If a delay, or anticipated delay, is caused by governmental
action without fault on the part of the developer an extension may be granted
for a period not longer than the period of the governmental delay.
         b.   For good cause shown, an extension may be granted for such
periods of time as the Zoning Enforcement Officer deems appropriate but not
exceeding twelve (12) months.
   I.   Revocation of Conditional Use Permits.
      1.   A conditional use permit may be revoked by the County Board after a
public hearing by the Zoning Board of Appeals and a finding that any of the
provisions of this Ordinance or any of the terms and conditions of the
conditional use permit approval have been violated.
         a.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall send written notice to
property owner and/or operator to whom the conditional use permit approval was
issued describing the reasons for revocation.
         b.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on the
revocation of the conditional use permit within sixty (60) calendar days after
providing notice to the property owner and to a newspaper of general
circulation in accordance with §
16.16.030B. (Published Notice).
         c.   The County Board shall take action within one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days of the close of the public hearing, unless an extension of
time has been authorized by the County Board prior to the expiration of the one
hundred eighty (180) calendar day timeframe. The County Board may take action
to approve or deny the revocation. If the County Board does not act with the
one hundred eighty (180) calendar day timeframe, including any extension of
time, the revocation is deemed denied.
      2.   A property owner granted conditional use permit approval may request
in writing for the voluntary revocation of conditional use permit approval to
the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Once the request is accepted and any applicable
fees are paid, all conditional use activities shall cease and all conditional
use structures shall be removed. If re-establishment is desired, a new
application is required.
   J.   Limitations on Denials. No application for a conditional use permit,
which has been denied by the County Board, may be resubmitted to the Zoning
Board of Appeals for a period of one (1) year from that date of denial, as
described in §
16.16.020G. (Successive Applications).

§ 16.20.050 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   A.   Purpose. Site plan review is a mandatory review process intended to
promote orderly development and redevelopment in the County, and to assure that
such development or redevelopment occurs in a manner that is harmonious with
surrounding properties, is consistent with the 2030 Comprehensive Plan, Water
Resources Action Plan, and 2040 Long Range Transportation Plan and promotes the
general welfare of the County. This section provides standards by which to
determine and control the physical layout and design to achieve the:
      1.   Compatibility of land uses and structures.
      2.   Efficient use of land.
      3.   Minimization of traffic and safety hazards.
      4.   Efficient parking layout.
      5.   Minimization of environmental problems.
      6.   Optimization of stormwater management and ground water protection.
      7.   Incorporation of sustainable design techniques.
      8.   Compliance with all County permit requirements including, but not
limited to, McHenry County Stormwater Management Ordinance, McHenry County
Public Health Ordinance, and McHenry County Access Control and Right-of-Way
Management Ordinance.
      9.   Protection of Class III Special Resources Groundwater Protection
Areas and Sensitive Aquifer Recharge Areas, as required by
Chapter 16.52 (Overlay Zoning Districts).
   B.   Authority.
      1.   Site plan review and approval is required for the following:
         a.   Conditional uses and planned developments.
         b.   Those uses identified in
Chapter 16.56 (Use Standards) as requiring site plan review prior to approval.
      2.   No building permit may be issued by the Department of Planning and
Development and no conditional use permit may be approved by the County Board
until site plan approval has been granted, as required in subsection B.1.
above. Prior to issuance of a building permit, review of the proposed
development for compliance with the McHenry County Public Health Ordinance, the
McHenry County Stormwater Management Ordinance and the McHenry County Access
Control and Right-of-Way Management Ordinance is required.
      3.   As part of subsequent conditional use permit approval, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may recommend and the County Board may impose additional
conditions on an approved site plan consistent with 55 ILCS 5/5-12020 as may be
amended from time to time.
   C.   Procedure.
      1.   Applications for site plan review shall be submitted to the
Department of Planning and Development in accordance with the requirements in §
16.16.020 (Application). Once it is determined that the application is
complete, the application will be scheduled for review at a Staff Plat Review
Committee meeting at least twenty-eight (28) days from the time of submittal.
In the case of applications for COMMERCIAL SOLAR ENERGY FACILITY and COMMERCIAL
WIND ENERGY FACILITY, Planning & Development Staff shall, as soon as
practicable after application submission, send a copy of the application to
each member of the Staff Plat Review for individual review and comment at least
fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the scheduled public hearing.
      2.   The Staff Plat Review Committee will review the completed site plan
review application and evaluate the site plan pursuant to the applicable
standards in subsection D. below (Standards for Site Plan Review).
      3.   During review of the site plan, the Staff Plat Review Committee may
request modification of the submitted site plan and resubmittal of a revised
plan. The revised site plan will be processed in the same manner as the initial
application.
      4.   Site plan review fees shall be paid in accordance with the County
adopted fee ordinance.
   D.   Standards for Site Plan Review.
      1.   Each site plan submitted for review shall include the following
details:
         a.   The location of principal and accessory structures, and all open
space.
         b.   The location of all water supply and sanitary waste (well and
septic) facilities.
         c.   All existing and proposed screening and landscaping.
         d.   All exterior lighting.
         e.   The location of parking lots, including required landscape
islands, buffers, number of parking spaces, driveways, and internal access
roads.
         Depending on the complexity of the project, the required details shall
be divided into multiple plan sheets as necessary to ensure legibility.
      2.   In addition, the following characteristics will also be considered:
         a.   The conformance of the site plan to adopted land use policies and
the policies of the 2030 Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance.
         b.   Compliance with other applicable County ordinances.
         c.   The location, arrangement, size, design, and general site
compatibility of structures, lighting, and signs, including:
            (1)   Efficient use of land that responds to the existing off-site
utilities and service conditions in order to minimize the demand for additional
municipal services, utilities, and infrastructure.
            (2)   Adequate water supply and sewage disposal in compliance with
the McHenry County Public Health Ordinance.
            (3)   Compatibility with, and mitigation of, any potential impact
upon, adjacent property.
            (4)   Site illumination designed and installed to minimize adverse
impact on adjacent properties.
         d.   Landscape and the arrangement of open space or natural features
designed to:
            (1)   Create a desirable and functional environment for motorists,
pedestrians, bicyclists, and occupants of residences and businesses. To achieve
such an environment, landscape may take advantage of open space design features
such as bike paths, running paths, and outdoor relaxation areas.
            (2)   Preserve unique natural resources, including preservation and
protection of existing healthy, mature trees.
            (3)   Protect natural resources and landscape on adjacent sites.
            (4)   Design drainage facilities to promote retention of water
onsite and preservation of natural watercourses and patterns of drainage.
            (5)   Utilize plant materials suitable to withstand the climatic
conditions of the County and microclimate of the site.
            (6)   Use of screening to buffer the impact of the development on
adjacent uses and screen incompatible uses and certain site elements, creating
a logical transition to contiguous lots and developments.
         e.   Circulation systems and off-street parking designed to:
            (1)   Provide adequate and safe access to the site for motor
vehicles as well as alternate modes of transportation, including pedestrians
and bicyclists.
            (2)   Minimize potentially dangerous traffic movements.
            (3)   Separate pedestrian and auto circulation, and provide for
bicycle parking or storage insofar as practical.
            (4)   Minimize curb cuts by using cross-access easements and shared
parking.
            (5)   Design off-street parking lots or garages to minimize adverse
impacts on adjacent properties, particularly through the use of perimeter and
interior landscape, and promote logical and safe parking and internal
circulation.
            (6)   Clearly define pedestrian access from the parking area to the
structures.
   E.   Amendments to Approved Site Plan Reviews.
      1.   Purpose. Site plans that have been approved by the Staff Plat Review
Committee may be amended based on the criteria and procedures in this section.
      2.   Procedure.
         a.   An application for an amendment to an approved site plan shall be
submitted to the Department of Planning and Development. Amendment applications
shall include a written description of the proposed change, including the
reason for such change, and a notation of the location on the approved site
plan.
         b.   Minor changes, as required by technical engineering or other
physical site circumstances not foreseen at the time that the site plan was
approved, may be authorized by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, who reserves the
right to forward any such request to the Staff Plat Review Committee for
approval. All other changes require approval by the Staff Plat Review
Committee.
         c.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may decide that the proposed
change or changes to the approved site plan is such a significant change that
it constitutes a new application and is subject to the complete site plan
review provisions of this section, including fees.
         d.   The Staff Plat Review Committee may determine that a proposed
amendment to an approved site plan requires submittal of a revised site plan
for proper evaluation. Submittal of the revised site plan only requires those
components of the submittal package impacted by the proposed change. Until such
revised site plan is submitted, the application is not considered complete.
Nothing within this section prevents an applicant from submitting a revised
site plan with the amendment application at the time of initial submission.

the Zoning Enforcement Officer provides the Zoning Board of Appeals with a
statement stating that a stay of the proceedings would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court on
notice to the Zoning Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken and on
due cause shown.

§ 16.20.100 TEMPORARY USE PERMIT.
Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new legislation (Ord. O-
202312-ZBA-074, passed 12-19-2023). The text of the amendment will be
incorporated below when the amending legislation is codified.
   A.   Purpose. A temporary use permit authorizes the temporary use of land
and structures for certain events and structures that are non-permanent in
nature. A temporary use permit authorizes only those temporary uses that occur
entirely on a zoning lot. Temporary uses located within the public right-of-way
are regulated separately by the roadway jurisdiction.
   B.   Initiation. Applications for temporary use permits may be initiated by
the property owner or other person expressly authorized in writing by the
property owner.
   C.   Authority. The Zoning Enforcement Officer is responsible for
determining compliance with this Ordinance and issuing a temporary use permit.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.    An application for a temporary use permit shall be filed with the
Zoning Enforcement Officer in accordance with the requirements in §
16.16.020 (Application) at least 30 days in advance of the date of the event.
      2.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may grant temporary use permits for
those temporary uses listed in §
16.56.040 (Temporary Use Standards) when it is determined that the proposed
temporary use complies with all requirements of this Ordinance and the
standards of subsection E. below (Standards). Unless otherwise permitted by
this Ordinance, every temporary use or structure shall comply with the bulk
requirements applicable in the district in which it is located.
      3.   Every temporary use shall comply with this Ordinance and all local
regulations. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or County Board may impose other
conditions as part of the temporary use permit approval to achieve the purposes
of this Ordinance and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
      4.   Multiple event periods require a temporary use permit for each
scheduled event.
      5.   The temporary use permit is issued for the days of the event. A
temporary use permit is not required for the additional days necessary for
event set-up or clean-up.
   E.   Standards. Every application for temporary use shall include sufficient
documentation to show compliance with the following standards:
      1.   The temporary use will not cause or threaten to cause an on-site or
off-site threat to the public health, safety, and welfare.
      2.   The temporary use will be operated in accordance with fire
department restrictions and conditions.
      3.   The additional vehicular traffic reasonably expected to be generated
by a temporary use will not have undue detrimental effects on surrounding
streets and uses, and does not block handicapped or fire lanes.
      4.   The temporary use will not unreasonably reduce the amount of parking
spaces available for use in connection with any permanent uses located on the
lot in question.
      5.   The temporary use will not conflict with another previously
authorized temporary use for the same site.
      6.   Provisions have been made for waste disposal (solid and human) and
for clearing debris, to be approved by the Department of Health.
      7.   Temporary food establishments will be operated in accordance with
County ordinances, to be approved by the Department of Health.
      8.   A security plan acceptable to the McHenry County Sheriff with
security personnel provided by an Illinois-licensed security contractor agency
licensed by the State of Illinois Department of Financial and Professional
Regulations to provide such security services, or by the Sheriff’s Department.
      9.   The location of paved or graded ingress and egress for emergency,
police, and regulatory traffic, including parking areas and traffic control
locations.
      10.   General liability insurance is required for all temporary use
events. If the temporary use permit is for a fireworks display, the County
shall be listed as a named insured. Additionally, dram shop insurance is
required for any temporary use event at which liquor is to be sold.
      11.   If applicable, the appropriate liquor license, issued pursuant to
the McHenry County Liquor Control Ordinance.
      12.   All other state and/or federal permits have been issued, as
required.
      13.   The maximum number of persons to be on-site per day, including
participants and spectators.
      14.   All structures used for a temporary use meet the building-code
requirements for that occupancy.
      15.   The time required for event set-up and tear-down is specified and
reasonable.
      16.   All temporary use events with an anticipated attendance of greater
than 2,500 shall have an Incident Action Plan approved by the McHenry County
Emergency Management Agency. The Incident Action Plan shall include law
enforcement, fire, public health, and public works/transportation roles and
responsibilities during the operational periods of the event. The McHenry
County Emergency Management Agency will coordinate development of the Incident
Action Plan with the applicant and appropriate agencies.
   F.   Violations. Noncompliance with this section or violation of any terms

§ 16.24.050 EXEMPTIONS FROM SUBDIVISION STANDARDS.
   A.   Purpose. A property owner or other person expressly authorized by the
owner in writing may request an exemption from the subdivision requirements of
Chapter 16.76 (Subdivision Standards) but only to provide relief from certain
practical difficulties or hardships in carrying out the strict letter of those
requirements. Only the subdivision requirements of
Chapter 16.76 (Subdivision Standards) are eligible for an exemption. Variation
from the zoning requirements of the applicable zoning district shall follow the
variation provisions of §
16.20.020 (Variation). The subdivision shall comply with the requirements of
all other ordinances unless variances from those ordinances are separately
approved by the responsible enforcement agency.
   B.   Process.
      1.   Requests for exemptions shall be made in writing and presented to
the Staff Plat Review Committee as part of the preliminary plat review process.
If the Staff Plat Review Committee determines that an exemption is unwarranted,
the applicant may appeal to the Planning, Environment, and Development
Committee. The Planning, Environment, and Development Committee may reverse or
affirm the decision of the Staff Plat Review Committee during their review of
the preliminary plat and preliminary engineering drawings. 
      2.   The exemption request shall be included as part of the preliminary
plat. Review of the exemption is required by both the Staff Plat Review
Committee and the Planning, Environment, and Development Committee, and will be
evaluated against the standards of subsection C. below (Standards). An
exemption request can move forward either by approval of exemption by both the
Staff Plat Review Committee and the Planning, Environment, and Development
Committee or, if an exemption is denied by the Staff Plat Review Committee it
may be appealed to the Planning, Environment, and Development Committee, which
may reverse or affirm the decision of the Staff Plat Review Committee.
   C.   Standards. Requests for exemptions shall, at a minimum, include
evidence and written documentation that demonstrate the exemption meets the
following standards:
      1.   The particular surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of
the specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the
owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulations was carried out.
      2.   The purpose of the exemption is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase the monetary gain realized from the property.
      3.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the Ordinance and
has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the
property.
      4.   That the granting of the exemption will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.

§ 16.32.030 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   A.   The Official Zoning Map of McHenry County, Illinois, is incorporated
into this Unified Development Ordinance.
   B.   The following rules are used to determine the precise location of any
zoning district boundary shown on the Official Zoning Map.
      1.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the limits
of any municipal corporation or McHenry County are construed as following such
limits.
      2.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets are
construed as following the centerlines of such streets.
      3.   Boundary lines shown as following or approximately following platted
lot lines or other property lines as designated in the official County plat
books are construed as following such lines.
      4.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following section
lines, half-section lines, or quarter-section lines are construed as following
such lines.
      5.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad
lines are construed to lie midway between the main track of such railroad line.
      6.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following shorelines
of any lakes are construed as following the mean high water lines of such
lakes. In the event of change in the mean high water line, boundaries are
construed as moving with the actual mean high water line.
      7.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the
centerlines of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing watercourses are
construed as following the channel centerline of such watercourses taken at
mean low water line. In the event of a natural change in the location of such
streams, rivers, or other watercourses, the boundary is construed as moving
with the channel centerline.
      8.   Boundaries shown as separated from and parallel or approximately
parallel to any of the features listed in this section, are construed to be
parallel to such features and from such distance as shown on the map. Distances
not specifically indicated on the map are determined by the scale of the map.
   C.   All streets, alleys, public ways, and railroad rights of way, if not
otherwise specifically designated, are deemed to be in the same zoning district
as the property immediately abutting said streets, alleys, public ways, and
railroad rights of way.

§ 16.32.050 EXEMPTIONS FOR PUBLIC ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   A.   The provisions of this Ordinance do not apply to land located within
rights-of-way dedicated to the state, county, or township for public road use.
The applicable management agency may have regulations that apply to such public
rights-of-way.
   B.   The provisions of this Ordinance do not apply to uses, buildings, or

Act (220 ILCS 5/), if the public utility is subject to the Messages Tax Act (35
ILCS 610/), the Gas Revenue Tax Act (35 ILCS 615/), or the Public Utilities
Revenue Act (35 ILCS 620/), or if such facilities or equipment are located on
any rights-of-way and are used for railroad purposes.
      1.   This exemption does not include: permanent aboveground structures
used for distribution to consumers of communications, wireless
telecommunications structures; amateur radio towers; solar panels; or, wind
turbines. Additionally, the exemption does not extend to entities that do not
meet the definition of a public utility in the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS
5/), including utilities owned and operated by any political subdivision,
public institution of higher education, or municipal corporation; private
companies for the distribution of water or disposal of sewage; and any

§ 16.32.060 ZONING DISTRICT USES.
Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new legislation (Ord. O-
202312-ZBA-074, passed 12-19-2023). The text of the amendment will be
incorporated below when the amending legislation is codified.
   
Table 16.32-1 : Zoning District Uses lists permitted, conditional, and
temporary uses for the zoning districts of this Ordinance.
   A.   A “P” indicates that a use is permitted within that district.
   B.   A “C” indicates that a use is a conditional use in that district and
must obtain a conditional use permit approval.
   C.   A “T” indicates that a use is a temporary use in that district and must
obtain a temporary use permit approval.
   D   No letter, or the absence of the use from the table, indicates that use
is not permitted within that district.
   E.   Certain uses are defined to be inclusive of many uses in order to
eliminate an overly detailed lists of uses. When a use meets a specific
definition, it is regulated as such and it shall not be regulated as a generic
use. A use that is not specifically listed in a zoning district, does not fall
within a use definition, or is interpreted pursuant to §
16.20.070 (Zoning Interpretations) as not part of a use definition, is
prohibited.

§ 16.36.010 ZONING DISTRICTS PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   A.   Agricultural Zoning Districts. Properties in agricultural zoning
districts are located in areas where land is used for commercial agricultural
production. Owners, residents, and other users of property in or adjoining
these districts may be subjected to inconvenience, discomfort, and the
possibility of injury to property and health arising from normal and accepted
agricultural practices and operations, including but not limited to noise,
odors, dust, the operation of machinery of any kind, including aircraft, the
storage and disposal of manure, the application of fertilizers, soil
amendments, herbicides, and pesticides. Therefore, owners, occupants, and users
of property within and adjacent to these areas should be prepared to accept
such inconveniences, discomfort, and possibility of injury from normal
agricultural operations, and are hereby put on official notice that the
Illinois “Right to Farm Law” (Farm Nuisance Suit Act 740 ILCS 70/) may bar them
from obtaining a legal judgement against such normal agricultural operations.
      1.   Purpose of A-1 Agriculture District. The intent of the A-
1 Agriculture District is to permit agricultural purposes and activities.
Residences are allowed on large agricultural parcels within the County. The
standards of the A-1 District promote the continuation of farming and protect
agricultural land uses from the encroachment of incompatible uses.
      2.   Purpose of A-2 Agriculture District. The intent of the A-
2 Agriculture District is to permit individual single-family residences within
agricultural portions of the County. All residences within this district must
be compatible with surrounding agricultural operations, and must maintain,
preserve, and enhance agricultural activities. Any zoning map amendments to the
A-2 District must meet the standards of §
16.36.020 (A-2 District Rezoning Standards).
   B.   Residential Zoning Districts.
      1.   Purpose of the E-5 Estate District. The intent of the E-5 Estate
District is to accommodate single-family residences on a minimum of five (5)
acres that, due to topography and location, are well suited for single-family
use. The E-5 District is intended to be located in close proximity to
municipalities or historic town centers where infrastructure and services are
readily accessible, to encourage the compact and contiguous development policy
of the 2030 Plan, and shall take into consideration the densities of the
adjacent municipality.
      2.   Purpose of the E-3 Estate District. The intent of the E-3 Estate
District is to accommodate single-family residences on a minimum of three (3)
acres that, due to topography and location, are well suited for single-family
use. The E-3 District is intended to be located in close proximity to
municipalities or historic town centers where infrastructure and services are
readily accessible, to encourage the compact and contiguous development policy
of the 2030 Plan, and shall take into consideration the densities of the
adjacent municipality.
      3.   Purpose of the E-2 Estate District. The intent of the E-2 Estate
District is to accommodate single-family residences on a minimum of two (2)
acres that, due to topography and location, are well suited for single-family
use. The E-2 District is intended to be located in close proximity to
municipalities or historic town centers where infrastructure and services are
readily accessible, to encourage the compact and contiguous development policy
of the 2030 Plan, and shall take into consideration the densities of the
adjacent municipality.
      4.   Purpose of the E-1 Estate District. The intent of the E-1 Estate
District is to accommodate single-family residences on a minimum of one (1)
acre that, due to topography and location, are well suited for single-family
use. The E-1 District is intended to be located in close proximity to
municipalities or historic town centers where infrastructure and services are
readily accessible, to encourage the compact and contiguous development policy
of the 2030 Plan, and shall take into consideration the densities of the
adjacent municipality.
      5.   Purpose of the R-1 Single-Family Residential District. The intent of
the R-1 Single-Family Residential District is to accommodate a single-family
residential use on lots a minimum of one-half (½) acre in size. The R-
1 District is for areas of higher residential density, located in close
proximity to municipalities or historic town centers where services are
available and more accessible.
      6.   Purpose of the R-2 Two-Family Residential District. The intent of
the R-2 Two-Family Residential District is to accommodate both single-family
and two-family residential uses on lots a minimum of one (1) acre in size. The
R-2 District is for areas of higher residential density, located in close
proximity to municipalities or historic town centers where services are
available and more accessible.
      7.   Purpose of the R-3 Multifamily Residential District. The intent of
the R-3 Multifamily Residential District is to provide for multifamily
residential use in areas where central utilities, facilities, and services
exist. The R-3 District is for areas of higher residential density, located in
close proximity to municipalities or historic town centers where services are
available and more accessible.
   C.   Commercial Districts.
      1.   Purpose of the B-1 Neighborhood Business District. The intent of the
B-1 Neighborhood Business District is to provide access to commercial uses for
adjacent residential areas, satisfying the basic shopping or service needs of
residents. Dwellings are permitted above or behind ground-floor commercial uses
to allow for a mixed-use environment.
      2.   Purpose of the B-2 Neighborhood Business District. The intent of the
B-2 Neighborhood Business District is to provide access to commercial uses for
adjacent residential areas, satisfying the basic shopping or service needs of
residents, and to accommodate businesses that serve alcoholic beverages for
consumption on-site, as well as package liquor sale. Dwellings are permitted
above or behind ground-floor commercial uses to allow for a mixed-use
environment.
      3.   Purpose of the B-3 General Business District. The intent of the B-
3 General Business District is to accommodate commercial uses that cater to the
needs of the population from the larger region. The B-3 District allows more
intense non-residential uses, which are often larger in scale and typically
generate truck traffic. Dwellings are permitted above or behind ground-floor
commercial uses to allow for a mixed-use environment.
   D.   Office and Industrial Districts.
      1.   Purpose of the O Office/Research District. The intent of the O
Office/Research District is to accommodate office and research facilities and
other related non-manufacturing activities in a campus-like environment. The O
District is generally located near or adjacent to municipalities. Dwellings are
permitted above or behind ground-floor office uses to allow for a mixed-use
environment.
      2.   Purpose of the I-1 Light Industrial District. The purpose of the I-
1 Light Industrial District is to provide for a wide variety of light
manufacturing, fabricating, processing, research, wholesale distributing, and
warehousing uses. Light industrial uses are enclosed low-intensity, non-
nuisance light fabrication, and assembly-type manufacturing, as well as
research facilities with little to no outside impacts. The industrial zoning
districts are generally located away from residential development and near
transportation facilities and municipalities. Dwellings are permitted above or
behind ground-floor light industrial uses to allow for a mixed-use environment,
typically for caretaker residences.
      3.   Purpose of the I-2 Heavy Industrial District. The purpose of the I-
2 Heavy Industrial District is to provide for a wide variety of general
manufacturing, fabricating, processing, wholesale distributing, and warehousing
uses. General industrial uses include fabrication, warehousing, and assembly-
type manufacturing, as well as office and research facilities, which may result
in some moderate external effects such as smoke, noise, glare, or vibration,
and typically include outdoor storage and related outdoor activities. The
industrial zoning districts are generally located away from residential
development and near transportation facilities and municipalities.

§ 16.36.020 A-2 DISTRICT REZONING STANDARDS.
   In addition to meeting the standards for a map amendment in §
16.20.010 (Zoning Map and Text Amendment), all rezonings to the A-2 District
must meet the following additional requirements:
   A.   Only property in the A-1 District is eligible for rezoning to the A-
2 District.
   B.   The subject property shall have an existing lawfully constructed
residential dwelling on the property. Mobile homes, agricultural trailers, and
agriculture employee housing do not qualify under this standard.
   C.   The zoning petition shall be restricted to a single existing or
proposed parcel.
   D.   The subject property shall meet one (1) of the following three (3)
relevant exemptions from the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/ et seq.) as amended. In
the event that the Plat Act is amended, the provisions of the Illinois Compiled
Statutes shall control.
      1.   The division or subdivision of land into parcels or tracts of five
(5) acres or more in size which does not involve any new streets or easements
of access.
      2.   The sale or exchange of parcels or tracts of land following the
division into no more than two (2) parts of a particular parcel or tract of
land existing on July 17, 1959 and not involving any new streets or easements
of access.
      3.   The sale of a single lot of less than five (5) acres from a larger
tract when a survey is made by an Illinois Registered Land Surveyor, provided
that this exemption shall not apply to the sale of any subsequent lots from the
same larger tract of land, as determined by the dimensions and configuration of
the larger tract on October 1, 1973, and provided also that this exemption does
not invalidate any local requirements applicable to the subdivision of land.

§ 16.36.030 ZONING DISTRICT USES.
   A.   Table 16.32-1: Zoning District Uses lists permitted, conditional, and
temporary uses for the zoning districts of this Ordinance.
   B.   Development in these districts must meet McHenry County Department of
Health requirements for septic suitable soils or other wastewater disposal
systems approved by the Department of Health.
   C.   As a condition of approval of a building permit for a new residential
structure for any lot or parcel of land not subdivided, a developer is required
to comply with the requirements of §
16.76.100 (School Donation Requirements) as if the lot or parcel were
subdivided.

§ 16.52.010 PURPOSE.
   Overlay zoning districts create special controls in certain areas of the
County that have special characteristics or development issues. The intent of
an overlay district is to provide common controls over areas that require a
specific type of zoning control in addition to the regulations of the base
zoning district.

§ 16.52.030 SENSITIVE AQUIFER RECHARGE AREA (SARA) AND CLASS III SPECIAL
RESOURCE GROUNDWATER PROTECTION AREAS OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   A.   Purpose.
      1.   SARA Overlay District Purpose. As aquifers are the only source of
potable water supply in McHenry County, the County desires to protect this
sensitive natural resource through the creation of the Sensitive Aquifer
Recharge Area (SARA) Overlay District. The intent of the SARA Overlay District
is to provide development standards that protect, preserve, and maintain the
most sensitive recharge areas within the unincorporated County. The SARA
Overlay District implements the Water Resources Action Plan to prevent damage
to the soil’s natural recharge ability.
      2.   Class III Special Resource Groundwater Protection Areas Purpose. The
Illinois Pollution Control Board designates Class III Special Resources
Groundwater Protection Areas to groundwater that is demonstrably unique and
suitable for application of a water quality standard more stringent than
otherwise applicable, is vital for a particularly sensitive ecological system,
or contributes to a dedicated Illinois Nature Preserve. The Class III Special
Resources Groundwater Protection Areas Overlay District is intended to provide
development standards that protect these water resources from the potential
negative impacts of development.
   B.   Mapping. 
      1.   SARA Overlay District Mapping. Mapping of the SARA Overlay District
is established by the McHenry County Water Resources Action Plan, adopted on
October 18, 2011, and as may be amended from time to time. Said map is included
as Appendix B of this Ordinance for reference.
      2.   Class III Special Resource Groundwater Protection Areas Mapping. The
Class III Overlay District consists of all areas designated as Class III
Special Resources Groundwater Protection areas identified by the Illinois
Pollution Control Board, and as may be amended from time to time. Said map is
included as Appendix B of this Ordinance for reference.
   C.   On-Site Verification and Review.
      1.   SARA On-Site Verification and Review. If a property owner can
provide evidence that their property does not have the characteristics of a
sensitive aquifer recharge area, and, the Zoning Enforcement Officer concurs
with the evidence submitted by the property owner, the provisions of the SARA
Overlay District do not apply to the site. In order to be considered, the
evidence must include soil or geologic study analysis, made by a hydrogeologist
or other qualified professional, which was conducted in a manner consistent
with the SARA mapping methodology. The County may seek independent expert
opinion regarding the geologic analysis and conclusions.
      2.   Class III Special Resource Groundwater Areas On-Site Verification
and Review.
         a.   A property owner may submit legal descriptions or survey data
documenting the location of their property relative to the location of a Class
III Special Resources Groundwater Protection area as designated by the Illinois
Pollution Control Board for the purpose of documenting that their property is
not located within a Class III Special Resources Groundwater Protection area.
If the Zoning Enforcement Officer concurs with the information submitted by the
property owner, the provisions of the Class III Overlay District do not apply
to the property.
   D.   Restricted Uses. The following uses are prohibited or have additional
restrictions when the property to be developed includes SARA Overlay District
or Class III Special Groundwater Resource Areas Overlay District:
      1.   The following types of pollution control facilities are prohibited:
         a.   Radioactive waste sites.
         b.   Municipal solid waste landfills.
         c.   Special or hazardous waste landfills.
      2.   Clean construction and demolition debris facilities, as defined by
the State of Illinois are prohibited unless the following standards are met:
         a.   The use shall comply with all state regulations and permit
requirements.
         b.   Quarterly groundwater sampling shall be conducted by Illinois
licensed professional engineers or Illinois licensed professional geologists.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall approve the groundwater monitoring plan.
      3.   Permanent asphalt/concrete batch plants are prohibited unless the
following standards are met:
         a.   The use shall comply with all state regulations and permit
requirements.
         b.   Quarterly groundwater sampling shall be conducted by Illinois
licensed professional engineers or Illinois licensed professional geologists.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall approve the groundwater monitoring plan.
This criteria can be satisfied if the asphalt/concrete batch plant is located
within an earth extraction and/or mining site with an approved groundwater
monitoring plan.
      4.   Salvage yards are prohibited unless the following standards are met:
         a.   A salvage yard shall be located, conformed, drained, and managed
so that it will not constitute a source of water pollution.
         b.   A pollution prevention plan is required and shall be approved by
the County, and shall comply with all local, federal, and state environmental
rules and regulations.
      5.   Class V underground injection wells, as defined by the State of
Illinois, are prohibited, unless the following standards are met:
         a.   Dry wells may be installed as part of an approved stormwater
management facility if designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with
the McHenry County Stormwater Management Ordinance, including any applicable
requirements for pretreatment of stormwater runoff.
         b.   On-site wastewater treatment systems may be installed if
designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the McHenry County
Public Health Ordinance.
         c.   Geothermal systems may be installed if designed, installed, and
maintained in accordance with the applicable County building codes, state
plumbing, and state water well construction codes.
      6.   Manufacturing and warehouse facilities that store any hazardous
substance identified in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA) in quantities equal to or greater than their
reportable quantity as identified in Title 40: Protection of Environment, §
302.4: Designation of hazardous substances, are prohibited, unless said
hazardous substances are for earth extraction and/or mining or agricultural
purposes.
   E.   Development Standards.
      1.   When the property to be developed includes SARA Overlay District or
any Class III Special Resource Areas Overlay District, the following standard
applies:
         a.   The maximum impervious surface coverage is limited to the lesser
of the maximum impervious surface area allowed in the zoning district or fifty
percent (50%), but in no case shall more than fifty percent (50%) of the SARA
Overlay District area on site be made impervious.
      2.   When the property to be developed contains any Class III Special
Resource Areas Overlay District, the property owner shall submit the proposed
development plans to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency prior to the
site plan review process.

§ 16.52.040 LEGACY NEIGHBORHOOD OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   A.   Purpose. McHenry County contains several unincorporated areas,
including waterfront and water-adjacent residential subdivisions and
neighborhoods, that developed prior to the introduction of zoning and
subdivision standards. The legacy of the historical pattern of development in
these areas are thousands of lots that do not conform with current zoning
district size and frontage requirements. The Legacy Neighborhood (LN) Overlay
District is intended to accommodate redevelopment and rehabilitation of
residential structures on nonconforming lots and parcels created before the
effective date of this Ordinance, which are the result of historical patterns
of development, by providing supplemental development standards. Application of
LN Overlay District supplemental standards does not affect allowed principal
uses, which are controlled by the base zoning district or §
16.80.030 (Nonconforming Uses), as applicable.
   B.   Eligibility of Lots and Parcels.
      1.   For a lot or parcel to be eligible for the LN Overlay District
supplemental standards, it must meet the following criteria.
         a.   The lot or parcel must be located within a LN Overlay District
mapped area (see
Appendix B).
         b.   The lot or parcel must be a nonconforming lot or parcel (per §
16.80.050) in an A-1 Agricultural Zoning District or an R-1 or R-2 Residential
Zoning District.
         c.   The lot or parcel must contain, as a principal structure, a
residence that was present as of the effective date of this Ordinance (October
22, 2014).
      2.   Lots and parcels are ineligible for the LN Overlay District
supplemental standards if any of the following apply.
         a.   The lot or parcel does not meet all of the criteria of §
16.52.040B.1.
         b.   The lot or parcel has been joined with adjacent lots or parcels
under common ownership by means of deed restriction or development that extends
from one lot or parcel onto the next and which together do not meet all of the
criteria of §
16.52.040B.1.
         c.   The lot or parcel has lost its eligibility. In such cases, the
criteria of §
16.52.040B.1. were initially met, but are not at present. This can occur when a
lot or parcel: is no longer within a LN Overlay District area due to subsequent
map revisions; is split, subdivided, or rezoned; or when the residence is
removed without providing notice to rebuild concurrently with a demolition
permit application or within 90 days of involuntary destruction.
      3.   Any development on an ineligible lot or parcel must conform all
standards of the base zoning district or obtain the required variance(s).
   C.   LN Overlay District Supplemental Standards. LN Overlay District
supplemental standards are a set of allowances and flexibilities affecting
standards for development, the rules for nonconforming structures, and the
rules for accessory structures. Owners of eligible lots or parcels (see §
16.52.040B.) may either follow the LN Overlay District supplemental standards
or the standards established by the base zoning district regarding
construction, alteration, or rehabilitation of structures. The two sets of
development standards cannot be used in combination.
      1.   Supplemental Standards for All Structures. Existing structures which
were lawfully constructed, or which qualify as a nonconforming structure per §
16.80.040A., may be replaced, altered, or rehabilitated so long as the new
structure does not exceed the footprint, height, and setbacks of the existing
structure, when such development does not comply with Table 16.52-1: LN Overlay
District Bulk and Setback Regulations.
      2.   Supplemental Standards for Principal Structures. Principal
structures may be rehabilitated, replaced, altered, or expanded so long as such
development complies with
Table 16.52-1: LN Overlay District Bulk and Setback Regulations.

      3.   Supplemental Standards for Accessory Structures. Accessory
structures may be rehabilitated, replaced, altered, or expanded so long as such
development complies with
Table 16.52-1 and the following criteria.
         a.   Structure height, measured at the highest point of the roof, is
limited to fourteen (14) feet for a flat or mansard roof design and eighteen
(18) feet for a pitched roof design for new construction. Existing structures
may be replaced at the existing structure height, per §
16.52.040C.1.
         b.   Accessory structures are prohibited in an effective street yard,
unless any of the following criteria are met:
            i.   The accessory structure is located a minimum of fifty (50)
feet from the street lot line.
            ii.   The accessory structure is a detached garage on a waterfront
lot or parcel located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the street lot line,
or, it meets the average setback of existing detached garages on the same side
of the blockface when sixty percent (60%) of that blockface is developed. For
blockfaces that extend more than six hundred (600) feet, only the lots located
within three hundred (300) feet of either side of the lot shall be considered.
In no case shall a setback be reduced to less than ten (10) feet from the
street lot line.
            iii.   The accessory structure is a solid fence on a waterfront lot
or parcel, no more than six (6) feet in height, and located no closer to the
street than a detached garage which is nonconforming or complies with the above
setback requirements. In no case shall a setback be reduced to less than ten
(10) feet from the street lot line.
         c.   A garage may be erected on a vacant non-contiguous property
directly across the street from a waterfront lot or parcel containing the
residence to which it is an accessory when a deed restriction has been recorded
stating that the two lots or parcels shall not be sold separately unless the
garage is first removed from the property. Minimum setback requirements
established in this section shall apply.

§ 16.56.030 PRINCIPAL USE STANDARDS.
   A.   Adult Use.
      1.   Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to promote the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of McHenry County, while
establishing reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent effects from a
deleterious location and concentration of adult uses within McHenry County, in
accordance with the Counties Code (55 ILCS 5/5 12001 et seq.), as amended.
         a.   It is not the intent or effect of this section to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market.
         b.   It is not the intent nor effect of this section to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
         c.   It is the intent of these regulations to provide safeguards to
ensure that adult uses do not provide a venue for human trafficking,
prostitution, illicit drug use, or other illegal activities.
      2.   Applicable Districts and Operations. Each adult use shall, prior to
commencement or continuation of such business, obtain conditional use permit
approval to operate an adult use in the I-1 or I-2 Districts. Each adult use
shall also comply with all applicable regulations in the zoning district where
the business is located.
      3.   Additional Application Requirements. An application for a

partners.
         c.   A detailed description of the manner of providing proposed
entertainment, including type of entertainment and the number of persons
engaged in the entertainment.
         d.   Hours of operation.
         e.   A location, address, and floor plan showing where the specific
entertainment uses will be conducted within the building.
         f.   The name or names of the person or persons having management or
supervision of the business and of any entertainment.
         g.   A statement of the nature and character of the business, if any,
to be carried on in conjunction with such entertainment.
         h.   For a renewal of the conditional use permit, the applicant(s) in
addition shall indicate any changes since the filing of the initial petition.
         i.   Whether the petitioner(s) or any of the other individuals
described has had a previous permit under this section or other similar
ordinances from another village, city, or county denied, suspended, or revoked,
including the name and location of the adult use for which the permit was
denied, suspended, or revoked, as well as the date of the denial, suspension,
or revocation, and whether the petitioner(s) or any other individuals listed
pursuant to this section has been a partner in a partnership or an officer,
director, or principal stockholder of a corporation that was permitted under
this section whose permit has previously been denied, suspended, or revoked,
including the name and location of the adult use for which the permit was
denied, suspended, or revoked as well as the date of denial, suspension, or
revocation.

to this section holds any other permits and/or licenses for an adult use from
another village, city, or county, and, if so, the names and locations or such
other permitted businesses.
         k.   If a person who wishes to operate an adult use is an individual,
he/she shall sign the application for a permit as applicant. If a person who
wishes to operate an adult use is other than an individual, each individual who
has a seven and one-half percent (7.5%) or greater interest in the business
shall sign the application for a permit as applicant. If a corporation is
listed as owner of an adult use or as the entity which wishes to operate such a
business, each individual having a seven and one-half percent (7.5%) or greater
interest in the corporation shall sign the application for a permit as
applicant.
      4.   Operation Requirements. It is unlawful for any person to operate,
engage in, conduct or carry on any adult use within McHenry County unless the
property owner(s) and business operator(s) of the adult use first obtains a
conditional use permit in addition to the appropriate zoning. Along with the
base zoning requirements, the following additional requirements shall be
satisfied by an adult use and included in any approved conditional use permit:
         a.   The adult use shall comply with the zoning, parking, development,
and design standards applicable to the district in which the business is
located.

shall be regulated, designed and provided in accordance with applicable
building codes, in addition to any other regulations and/or standards, adopted
by McHenry County.
         c.   No adult use is permitted to operate in any manner that permits
the observation of any material depicting, describing, or relating to specified
sexual activities and/or specified anatomical areas from any public way or from
any location outside the building or area of such establishment. This provision
applies to any display, decoration, sign, show window, or other opening.
         d.   Lighting and video surveillance is required to illuminate all
off-street parking areas serving such use for the purpose of increasing the
personal safety of adult use employees and adult use patrons and reducing the

clearly and legibly posted with a notice indicating that minors are precluded
from entering the property and building. The notice shall be constructed and
posted to the satisfaction of the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
         g.   Landscape shall conform to the standards of this Ordinance.
However, if the adult use is the sole use on a lot, plantings are limited to
thirty (30) inches in height, except trees with foliage no less than six (6)
feet above the ground.
         h.   The adult use shall not be located, in whole or in part, within
any portable structure.
         i.   The adult use is prohibited from conducting or sponsoring any
special events, promotions, festivals, concerts, or similar activities that
would increase the demand for parking spaces beyond the approved number of
spaces for the business.
         j.   It is unlawful to sell, serve, or permit the consumption of
alcohol in a structure or on the property occupied by an adult use.
         k.   Any adult use that allows adult use patrons to remain on the
premises while viewing any live, filmed, or recorded entertainment, or while
using or consuming the products or services supplied on the premises, shall
conform to the following requirements:
            (1)   At least one (1) security guard is required to be on duty
outside the premises, patrolling the grounds and parking areas, at all times
while the business is open. If the occupancy limit of the premises is greater
than fifty (50) persons, an additional security guard is required to be on duty
inside the premises. The security guard(s) is charged with preventing
violations of law and enforcing compliance by patrons with the requirements of
this Ordinance, and notifying the McHenry County Sheriff’s Department and
Zoning Enforcement Officer of any violations of law observed. Required security
guards shall be provided by an Illinois licensed Security Contractor Agency
licensed by the State of IL Department of Financial and Professional
Regulations to provide such security services. Required security guard(s) shall
be uniformed so as to be readily identifiable as a security guard by the
public. No required security guard is permitted to act as a door person, ticket
seller, ticket taker, or admittance person while acting as a security guard.
            (2)   No exterior door or window on the premises can be propped or
kept open at any time while the business is open. All exterior windows shall be
covered with opaque covering at all times. Such opaque covering shall be in
compliance with building codes adopted by McHenry County.
            (3)   Permanent barriers shall be installed and maintained to
screen the interior of the premises from public view for each door used as an
entrance/exit to the business.
         l.   All indoor areas of the adult use within which patrons are
permitted, except restrooms, shall be open to view at all times.
         m.   No adult material is permitted to be displayed in such manner as
to be visible from any location other than within the premises occupied by the
adult use.
         n.   No person under the age of eighteen (18) years, including, but
not limited to adult use employees/entertainers, adult use patrons, and the
children of adult use employees/entertainers and adult use patrons, is
permitted on the property or in the building of an adult use at any time.
         o.   The adult use shall provide and maintain separate restroom
facilities for male adult use patrons and adult use employees, and female adult
use patrons and adult use employees. Male adult use patrons and adult use
employees are prohibited from using the restroom(s) for females, except to
carry out duties of repair, maintenance, and cleaning of the restroom
facilities and vise-versa. The restrooms shall be kept free from any adult
material. Restrooms are prohibited from containing television monitors or other
motion picture or video projection, recording, or reproduction equipment. These
provisions of this paragraph are be applicable to an adult use which deals
exclusively with the sale or rental of adult material which is not used or
consumed on the premises, such as an adult bookstore or adult video store, and
which does not provide restroom facilities to its adult use patrons or the
general public.
         p.   Adult uses are prohibited from operating during the hours from
12:00 a.m. (midnight) to 4:30 p.m.
         q.   The following additional requirements pertain to adult arcades
that provide one (1) or more viewing areas:
            (1)   Upon filing a petition for a conditional use permit for an
adult arcade, the application shall be accompanied by a diagram of the premises
showing a plan thereof specifying the location of one (1) or more manager’s
stations, the location of all overhead lighting fixtures and designating any
portion of the premises in which patrons will not be permitted. A manager’s
station is limited to thirty-two (32) square feet of floor area with no
dimension greater than eight (8) feet. A professionally prepared diagram in the
nature of an engineer’s or architect’s blueprint is not be required, but each
diagram shall be oriented to the north or to some designated street or object
and drawn to one-quarter-inch (¼") scale with marked dimensions sufficient to
show the various internal dimensions of all areas of the interior of the adult
arcade to an accuracy of plus or minus six (6) inches.
            (2)   No alteration in the configuration or location of a manager's
station(s) may be made without the prior approval of the Department of Planning
and Development.
            (3)   It is the duty of the owner(s) to ensure that at least one
(1) employee is on duty and situated at each manager’s station at all times
that any patron is present inside the adult arcade.
            (4)   The interior of the adult arcade shall be configured in such
a manner that there is an unobstructed view from a manager’s station of every
area of the adult arcade to which any adult use patron is permitted access for
any purpose excluding restrooms. If the adult arcade has two (2) or more
manager’s stations designated, then the interior of the adult arcade shall be
configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed view of each area of
the adult arcade to which any adult use patron is permitted access for any
purpose, excluding restrooms, from at least one (1) of the manager's stations.
The view required in this subsection shall be by direct line of sight from the
manager’s station.
            (5)   It is the duty of the owner(s) and all employees present in
the adult arcade to ensure that the individual viewing area remains
unobstructed by any doors, walls, persons, merchandise, display racks, or other
materials at all times, and to ensure that no patron is permitted access to any
area of the adult arcade which has been designated as an area in which patrons
will not be permitted.
            (6)   No individual viewing area may be occupied by more than one
(1) person at any one time. Individual viewing areas of the adult arcade shall
be operated and maintained without any hole or other opening or means of direct
communication or visual or physical access between the interior space of two
(2) or more individual viewing areas.
            (7)   No individual viewing area can contain booths, stalls, or
partitioned portions used for the viewing of adult material or other forms of
entertainment, having doors, curtains, or portal partitions, unless such
individual viewing areas containing booths, stalls, or partitioned portions
have at least one (1) side open to the manager’s station and visible to the
manager’s station. Any authorized booth, stall or partitioned portion of an
individual viewing area shall be constructed to allow twelve (12) inches of
open space between the bottom of the stall or partition and the floor. Such
open space shall remain unobstructed at all times.
            (8)   The adult arcade shall be equipped with overhead lighting
fixtures of sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are
permitted access, but such lighting shall not be of an intensity as to prevent
the viewing of the adult material.
            (9)   It is the duty of the owner(s) and all employees present in
the adult arcade to ensure that the illumination described above is maintained
at all times that any adult use patron is present in the adult arcade.
         r.   The following additional requirements pertain to adult uses
providing live entertainment depicting specified anatomical areas and/or
involving specified sexual activities:
            (1)   All live entertainment for patrons of an adult use shall be
performed on a stage at least eighteen (18) inches above the level of the floor
and separated by a distance of at least six (6) feet from the nearest area
occupied by patrons. No patron is permitted within six (6) feet of the stage
while the stage is occupied by an adult use entertainer.
            (2)   The adult use shall provide separate dressing room facilities
for adult use entertainers exclusively dedicated to the adult use entertainers’
use. Such facilities shall be clearly marked with signs indicating that they
are restricted to use by adult use entertainers only.
            (3)   The adult use shall provide an entrance/exit to the adult use
for adult use entertainers separate from the entrance/exit used by adult use
patrons.
            (4)   The adult use shall provide access for adult use entertainers
between the stage and the dressing rooms completely separated from the adult
use patrons. If such a separate access is not physically feasible, the adult
use shall provide a minimum three (3) foot wide walk aisle for adult use
entertainers between the dressing room area and the stage, with a railing,
fence, or other barrier separating the adult use patrons and the adult use
entertainers capable of, and which actually results in, preventing any physical
contact between adult use patrons and adult use entertainers.
            (5)   Any adult use entertainer, either before, during, or after
performances, are prohibited from physical contact with any adult use patron
and all adult use patrons are prohibited from physical contact with any adult
use entertainer either before, during, or after performances by such adult use
entertainer on the site of the adult use.
            (6)   Fixed rail(s) at least thirty (30) inches in height shall be
maintained, establishing the separations between adult use entertainers and
adult use patrons required by this subsection A.4.r4.(6).
            (7)   The adult use shall be equipped with overhead lighting
fixtures of sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which adult use
patrons are permitted access with an illumination of no less than twenty (20)
footcandles as measured at the floor level.
            (8)   No tipping is permitted between any adult use employee/
entertainer and adult use patrons.
            (9)   A sign containing a phone number to call to report human
trafficking shall be posted in a location visible to adult use employee/
entertainers and adult use patrons.
         s.   The adult use shall not result in an increase in crime by more
than ten percent (10%) in the neighborhood in which it is located as evidenced
by calls to the McHenry County Sheriff’s Department in any three-month (3-
month) period.

the time specified, the owner shall apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a
renewal of the permit.
            (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals will hold a public hearing. All
maps required by this ordinance for the initial hearing shall be revised,
updated, and resubmitted along with a statement of the current status of the
reclamation. A new map describing conditions present on the site shall be
furnished as described in “Existing Conditions” section of the Standards.
            (3)   The applicant shall furnish the Department of Planning and
Development with a copy of the required maps, plans, and other related exhibits
for review of the revised or extended reclamation plan no less than thirty (30)
days before the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing.
            (4)   The Department of Planning and Development will prepare a
report on the revised or extended reclamation plan and enter it into evidence
at the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing.
            (5)   Any application for a renewal of a conditional use permit
shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals a minimum of one hundred twenty
(120) days before the expiration date of the original conditional use permit or
any renewal. Failure to file a request for renewal within the required time
results in a required cessation of operations and, if applicable, the sale of
product upon the expiration of the conditional use permit.
      5.   Required Bonds.
         a.   An owner is required to obtain the proper permits and submit a
bond or other acceptable form of surety. If a bond is required by the State of
Illinois, the owner is only required to provide the Department of Planning and
Development with a photocopy. A bond of no less than two thousand five hundred
dollars ($2,500.00) for each acre affected is required. The actual dollar
amount will be established during the hearing process with the Zoning Board of
Appeals, based upon one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the engineer’s estimate
of the cost of reclamation per acre average at the time earth extraction and/or
mining operation(s) are to be performed. This estimate shall take into
consideration inflation of costs in future years. The actual operation will be
monitored by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, who will prepare a written report
on the progress before partial or full release of the surety.
         b.   The surety will be held by the Department of Planning and
Development. The bond will remain in effect until the affected lands have been
reclaimed in accordance with the reclamation plan and the work is approved by
the Department of Planning and Development and the Zoning Enforcement Officer
at the annual review of the operation.
         c.   Earth extraction and/or mining operation(s) are not allowed
unless a bond has been posted with the Department of Planning and Development.
The form and type of surety shall be approved by the Office of the State’s
Attorney of McHenry County. The surety will be for assurance of completion of
reclamation and the initial surety amount set on an anticipated three (3) years
working basis with reasonable allowance for inflation of costs. Before the end
of each one-year (1-year) period, the Zoning Enforcement Officer’s evaluation
and the approval of the past years work will be required for release of or
reduction of the bond amount and at that time, re-bonding established for the
next one-year (1-year) period or fraction thereof.
      6.   Reclamation Plan.
         a.   Reclamation Regulations. The applicant must submit a reclamation
plan map and statement of sequential operation and reclamation as a condition
of approval. The reclamation plan shall be submitted no less than thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the opening of the public hearing. The Department of
Planning and Development shall prepare a report on the reclamation plan and
enter it into evidence at the public hearing. The reclamation plan map shall
produce a finished condition that provides for the return of the affected land
to a useful purpose.
         b.   Changes to the Reclamation Plan. In the event that a change in
the reclamation plan is necessary due to the unanticipated characteristics of
the area concerned, the Department of Planning and Development shall be
provided with appropriate documentation, and will study the proposed change and
give the report to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Planning and
Development Committee for their review. Changes may be made in the reclamation
plan upon the request of the owner and require approval from the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and the Planning and Development Committee. The change(s)
shall preserve, as substantially as possible, the original reclamation plan,
but may provide for previously unknown variables.
         c.   Finished Conditions. The finished conditions of all land affected
by earth extraction and/or mining operation(s) shall:
            (1)   Be graded to a rolling topography traversable by machines
necessary for maintenance in accordance with planned use, with slopes of no
more than a fifteen percent (15%) grade. In the case of those lands to be
reclaimed in accordance with the filed plan for forest plantations, recreation
or wildlife, the final cut spoil, the outside slope of the box cut spoil, the
outside slopes of all overburden deposition areas, and the side slopes of
haulage road inclines are limited to a maximum thirty percent (30%) grade, but
such slopes need not be reduced to less than the original grade of the
overburden of the area prior to earth extraction and/or mining operation(s).
            (2)   Be designed to control conditions that could cause erosion on
site or on surrounding properties.
            (3)   Be designed so that any surface drainage from the property
leaves the property at the original, natural drainage points. If this is not
possible, the drainage plans shall be reviewed by the Department of Planning
and Development as part of the overall submission. Drainage volume shall not be
increased over what it would have been if the site remained in its former use.
The finished condition shall meet McHenry County Stormwater Management
Ordinance standards.
            (4)   Be covered with arable topsoil to a minimum depth of six (6)
inches and have a minimum of ten percent (10%) organic material. However, no
greater depth of topsoil or percentage of organic material is required than
that originally existing on the property prior to commencement of operations.
            (5)   After replacement of the topsoil, be successfully planted
with native vegetation (trees, shrubs, legumes, grasses, or groundcover) or
agricultural crops in accordance with the reclamation plan in order to avoid
erosion in the numbers and sizes of plantings described in the plan.
            (6)   Whenever earth extraction and/or mining on any property is
complete, all processing plants, structures other than those shown to remain on
the reclamation plan, fences, and equipment shall be entirely removed from the
property within one (1) year from the expiration date of the conditional use
permit.
            (7)   If applicable, prior to the termination of the conditional
use permit, the owner shall file with the McHenry County Recorder, a permanent
easement, approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer after review by the
McHenry County’s State’s Attorney’s Office, that provides access to the real
estate for the purpose of monitoring and sampling of the then existing wells.
         d.   Reclamation Plan Requirements.
            (1)   General. A reclamation plan shall consist of a combination of
graphic representation and written or printed text, the proportions of which
may vary, but together they shall be sufficient to result in comprehensive and
understandable documents showing the intent, methods, and processes of
reclamation of the land as well as the extent of the site, the initial
conditions, intermediate stages, and ultimate arrangement of land forms. The
reclamation plan shall describe these conditions and procedures completely and
clearly so that the plans may become regulatory documents to be used or
referred to in the implementation of its intent.
            (2)   Plan Elements. The following four (4) elements are required
for the reclamation plan, and for each element certain standards are cited. Due
to natural differences at each earth extraction site, each element may vary in
the preparation of plans for different sites, however, each element must be
addressed as appropriate for each site.
               (a)    Common Mapping Standards. Each plan element shall depict
the following information:
                  i.    Site Mapping: One inch to one hundred feet (1"=100')
preferable, or one inch to two hundred feet (1"=200') alternative acceptable.
                  ii.    Contour Interval: Two (2) feet for slopes thirty
percent (30%) or less; ten (10) feet for greater slopes when map scale is one
inch to one hundred feet (1"=100) feet. All contours shall be in terms of
elevations above mean sea level (USGS MSL or MGVD).
                  iii.    Contour Interval: Two (2) feet for slopes twenty
percent (20%) or less; ten (10) feet for greater slopes when map scale is one
inch to two hundred feet (1"=200') feet. All contours shall be in terms of
elevations above mean sea level (USGS MSL or MGVD).
                  iv.    Roads or Streets: Name, right-of-way width, and road
within right-of-way, and centerline elevations at fifty-foot (50') intervals
for three hundred (300) feet beyond the site.
                  v.    Easements: Widths and identification of utility or
other purpose.
               (b)    Element 1: Existing Conditions. The purpose of Element 1
is to provide sufficient information to describe the existing conditions at the
site including topographic, hydrologic, and other data relating to the property
to be mined and the area immediately adjacent to the perimeter of that
property, and to establish a beginning point for measurement of mining and
reclamation progress. Element 1 shall include the following information:
                  i.    Common mapping standards as listed above.
                  ii.    Natural Land Features: Locations of watercourses and
drainageways, floods of record, sinks, basins, wooded areas, and wetlands as
identified on National Wetlands Inventory quadrangle maps.
                  iii.    Man-Made Features: All buildings and other
structures, dams, dikes, and impoundments of water.
                  iv.    Adjacent Land Features: All of the standards above
shall apply to delineation of the area within three hundred (300) feet of the
perimeter of the mined area. In addition, all platted subdivision lots and
metes and bounds parcels must be shown.
                  v.    Groundwater: Locations of at least five (5) borings
which show depths to groundwater, date of observed water levels twenty-four
(24) hours after drilling and surface elevations of borings shall be noted.
                  vi.    Cross-Sections (as required) to Illustrate Conditions:
Vertical scale equal to, or in exaggeration of, horizontal scale.
               (c)    Element 2: Mining Operations, Procedures, and Phases. The
purpose of Element 2 is to provide sufficient information in the form of a map,
diagrams, or other graphics accompanied by descriptive text to show the extent
of the area to be mined, define the limits of the area where processing will
take place, where process water will be ponded, and how processed material will
be transported, and to illustrate the sequences of the reclamation process and
describe the time relationship of the phases. The document produced should be
sufficiently specific to aid in administration of monitoring the progress of
mining and reclamation. Element 2 shall include the following information:
                  i.    Common mapping standards as listed above.
                  ii.    Processing areas shall be identified and boundaries
shown to scale.
                  iii.    Access road to processing and mining areas shown to
scale.
                  iv.    Sequences of operation showing approximate areas
involved shall be shown to scale and serially numbered with a description of
relation of mining to reclamation follow-up activity and timing.
                  v.    Locations of screening berms shall be shown to scale
and notes shall be provided indicating when they will be used as reclamation
material. In the same manner, overburden storage areas shall be identified and
noted.
                  vi.    Fences and gates shall be shown on the site map and
their type or construction shall be described. Any fencing related specifically
to certain phases of mining or reclamation shall be identified and noted.
                  vii.    Proposed locations of principal service or processing
buildings or enclosures shall be shown as well as locations of settling basins
and process water ponds.
                  viii.    Site drainage features shall al so be shown and flow
directions indicated.
                  ix.    A Spill Prevention Containment and Control Plan for
asphalt batching, concrete mixing, petroleum products, or other hazardous
chemical storage.
               (d)    Element 3: Reclamation Plan (Final Land Form). The
purpose of Element 3 is to give a reasonably accurate description of the final
form of the reclaimed land after all mining has been completed and processing
equipment, settling basins, process water sources etc., have been removed or
eliminated. The solution of the problem of end-match of new contours to old
contours of peripheral land should be evident as should all problems of
compatibility of physical characteristics of new land forms to surrounding
land, land use, and drainage. Element 3 shall include the following
information:
                  i.    Common mapping standards as listed above.
                  ii.    Locations of any proposed roads within the reclaimed
area and their connection to present public roads beyond.
                  iii.    Locations of any lakes, ponds, or streams proposed
within the reclaimed area and their connections to streams or drainageways
beyond.
                  iv.    Locations of any proposed man-made structures within
the reclaimed area (dams, buildings, etc.).
                  v.    Locations of all buildings within three hundred (300)
feet of the perimeter of the mining site.
                  vi.    Area where vegetation is to be established and
indicate types of vegetative cover.
                  vii.    Describe the degree of flexibility considered to be
needed in execution of the plan.
               (e)    Element 4: Use of Reclaimed Land. The purpose of Element
4 is to show that the final land form portrayed in the drawings for Element 3
has a viable land use compatible with land use trends of the surrounding area.
The base map for this element should be the final land form map upon which
shall be shown, by overlays or separate drawings and notes, one or more
developed schemes for end land use or uses, each demonstrating that developed
areas are accessible by roads and that physical attributes of the final land
form are compatible with the proposed use or uses. It is understood that this
is a hypothetical exercise and will be evaluated as such. It should not be
considered a commitment to the use portrayed by either the applicant or the
County as such end use or uses may require additional zoning and review for
approval. Element 4 shall include the all the information required in Element
3: Reclamation Plan (Final Land Form).
      7.   Operation Requirements.
         a.   Existing trees, shrubs, and other types of woody vegetation along
road frontages shall be protected and maintained. Weeds and other unsightly
noxious vegetation shall be cut or trimmed as necessary to present a neat
appearance and prevent the hazard of grass fires.
         b.   No earth extraction and/or mining operation(s) is permitted to
operate in such a manner that the groundwater table of surrounding properties
is adversely impacted. In the case of mining operations, water pumped from the
site for the purpose of washing shall be retained in a pond until the silt and
clay settles and then the water recycled in the area affected. Groundwater
quality shall be monitored and maintained on a regular basis in accordance with
monitoring practices. Groundwater monitoring parameters are established in
subsection P.8. below (Groundwater Monitoring). Monitoring reports are to be
conducted on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year that the
operation continues and submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
         c.   If the subject areas front on a township road used for site
access, the owner, at commencement of operations, shall bring that township
road up to the paving standards required by this Ordinance from the entrance of
the subject area to the nearest federal, state, or County road used by the
operator. The owner shall repair any section of road damaged as a result of
hauling operations, but is not responsible for the normal wear and tear of the
road. This provision does not require the operator to purchase additional
right-of-way.
         d.   All operations shall be conducted in a safe manner, especially
with respect to hazards to persons, damage to adjacent lands or improvements
and wells, and damage to any street by slides, sinking, or collapse of
supporting soil adjacent to an excavation.
         e.   The following apply to earth extraction and/or mining conditions
only:
            (1)   Earth extraction and/or mining operation(s) that remove and
do not replace the lateral support shall be located a minimum of thirty (30)
feet from property lines, established right-of-way lines of any public roads,
streets, or highways unless a lesser distance is mutually agreed to by the
owner and adjacent property owner and submitted in writing.
            (2)    The bottom of the slope of the excavated face shall be no
closer to the point determined in subsection P.7.e.(1) above, than a distance
equal to one and one-half (1½) times the depth of the excavation.
            (3)   If consolidated materials occur in the excavated face, the
slope of the face may be steeper than one and one-half (1½) to one (1) slope
per subsection P.7.e.(2) above for the depth(s) of those materials, however all
other excavated slopes of unconsolidated materials are limited to one and one-
half (1½) to one (1) slope.
            (4)   In the case that the right-of-way has not been recently
surveyed by a registered land surveyor and clearly marked, the right-of-way
line is assumed to be, for the purpose of this section, a minimum of forty (40)
feet from the centerline of the existing road.
         f.   All active operations shall be separated by an earthen berm no
less than six (6) feet in height and/or a farm fence of no less than fifty-four
(54) inches in height, and designed to allow the free flow of wild animals, but
discourage trespassing by humans and farm animals. Berms that remain in place
for one (1) year or longer shall be planted with grass, shrubs, and trees, and
maintained as a visual and acoustical screen. They shall be designed so that
they do not erode into the road or highway right-of-way or onto a contiguous
property. All berms located along roadways must comply with all applicable
state regulations.
         g.   The processing and stockpiling of aggregate resources is
prohibited within three hundred (300) feet of the property line of any
contiguous property in a residential zoning district.
         h.   The hours of operation for all activities, other than maintenance
functions, are restricted to 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. from April 1 until October 31.
The remainder of the year, the hours of operation are restricted to 6 a.m. to 6
p.m. In emergency situations, operations are permitted at times otherwise
prohibited. An emergency situation, for the purpose of this section, is any
operation necessary to provide repairs to roadways or provide other materials
and assistance that, if delayed until normally permitted hours, would cause
injury or loss of life or property. Any emergency operation or activity under
this section shall be immediately reported to the McHenry County Sheriff’s
Department and reported to the Zoning Enforcement Officer the next business
day.
         i.   Operations shall be conducted so that noise levels and air and
water standards comply with federal and State of Illinois requirements.
         j.   Access ways and on-site roads shall be maintained in a dust-free
condition.
         k.   The premises shall be neat and orderly, free from junk, trash, or
unnecessary debris. Buildings shall be maintained in a sound condition and in
good repair and appearance. Salvageable equipment stored in a non-operating
condition shall be suitably screened or garaged.
         l.   Enough topsoil shall be stockpiled to meet the required finished
conditions.
         m.   No operations may occur on the property without an Annual
Operations Permit issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. The operations
permit may be for less than the total area proposed. The construction of access
or haul roads, building and landscape of required berms, and other site
improvements required for site preparation do not require an Annual Operations
Permit.
         n.   At all times, the owner shall take adequate measures to insure
that contaminated surface water run-off does not enter ponds, streams,
wetlands, or other areas of open standing water.
         o.   The owner shall take adequate measures within the site to insure
that trucks, exiting the site on roadways, do not discharge earth materials or
debris on the roadway.
         p.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer, or a duly authorized
representative, has the free right of access to the subject property for the
purpose of inspections, making water level measurements, obtaining water or
material samples, and for gathering other information necessary for the proper
discharge of responsibilities.
         q.   The owner is assessed an annual fee to pay for compliance
monitoring based on costs.
      8.   Groundwater Monitoring.
         a.   General Requirements.
            (1)   The cost of setting up a groundwater monitoring network,
monitoring and any remedial action to remedy contamination caused by the earth
material extraction site is the responsibility of the owner.
            (2)   The owner shall notify the Zoning Enforcement Officer at
least twenty-four (24) hours prior to sampling of the time and day that
groundwater samples will be taken.
            (3)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer, in conjunction with the
Department of Health, reserves the right to enter the earth materials
extraction site at all reasonable hours to collect samples or to co-sample any
monitoring well.
            (4)   Upon renewal of a conditional use permit for an existing
earth extraction operation or upon approval of a conditional use permit for a
new earth extraction operation a baseline PNA (Polynuclear Aromatics) shall be
conducted.
         b.   Monitoring Well Requirements.
            (1)   For operations that currently exist pursuant to a previously
issued conditional use permit by the County Board, the current groundwater
wells will be used to meet the groundwater monitoring requirements.
            (2)   Those earth extraction operations that are not required to
conduct groundwater monitoring as of the date of adoption of this Ordinance
shall establish site specific geology, aquifers and groundwater flows by a
qualified professional hydrogeologist. Monitoring well locations shall be
representative of the aquifer(s) impacted by the earth material extraction
operation. There shall be a minimum of one (1) up-gradient and two (2) down-
gradient wells established. The location, number of wells, and depth(s) shall
be contingent on the hydrogeological evaluation. Construction techniques and
materials used shall be those consistent with acceptable standards for
groundwater monitoring wells. Plans for placement, materials and construction
details shall be submitted in writing by the hydrogeologist to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer prior to construction. Monitoring wells shall not be
modified, deepened, or relocated without the prior approval of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer.
            (3)   Monitoring wells shall not be obstructed and shall remain
accessible at all times for sampling.
            (4)   Monitoring wells shall be maintained in good condition as
designed and constructed and shall be protected from vehicular traffic.
            (5)   Monitoring wells that have an insufficient quantity of water
to conduct sampling for two (2) consecutive sampling events shall be deepened
or relocated as approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer to yield groundwater
samples.
         c.   Sampling Frequency and Parameters.
            (1)   Quarterly sampling shall be for those parameters listed in
the general groundwater quality and contamination indicators in
Table 16.56-1: General Groundwater Quality Indicators. Results shall be
provided in an electronic format to the Zoning Enforcement Officer within
forty-five (45) days of the sampling.
            (2)   When sample results confirm an exceedance of chloride,
nitrate or ammonium nitrogen, or a detection of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene
or xylene, the monitoring well shall be re-sampled for that parameter within
thirty (30) calendar days with a copy of the results provided in an electronic
format to the Zoning Enforcement Officer within fourteen (14) calendar days of
the sampling.
            (3)   Sampling of chloride, nitrate, pH, ammonium nitrogen, and
specific conductance, may be reduced to annual subsequent to establishment of
the background groundwater quality if there have been no exceedances of
chloride, nitrate, or ammonium nitrogen for the most recent full year of
sampling.
            (4)   Sampling of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene may be
reduced to annual subsequent to establishment of the background groundwater
quality if there have been no detections of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
xylene for the most recent full year of sampling.
            (5)   In the event of an exceedance of chloride, nitrate, or
ammonium nitrogen, the sampling frequency for that parameter shall return to
quarterly.
            (6)   In the event of a detection of benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene, or xylene, the sampling frequency for that parameter shall return
to quarterly.
            (7)   Where asphalt batching, concrete mixing, or where petroleum
products or other hazardous chemical storage takes place, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer reserves the right to request additional parameters to be
tested.
            (8)   Additional water sampling parameters or frequency may be
required if water contamination is indicated. This will be determined by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer in conjunction with the Department of Health and the
owner. The Zoning Enforcement Officer will notify the owner of the modified
sampling parameters required.
            (9)   Water samples are to be taken and tested by Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency approved methods and procedures and protocol.
The test wells shall be purged two (2) times the volume of the well before the
sample is drawn.
            (10)   In the event that an exceedance of chloride, nitrate, or
ammonium nitrogen is due to natural background, resulted from an error in
sampling, analysis, or evaluation, or does not exceed the MCLs (maximum
contaminant levels) set forth in
Table 16.56-1 and does not cause adverse health effects, the Zoning Enforcement
Officer may, after consultation with the Department of Health, allow the
sampling frequency to be reduced to annual.
            (11)   In the event that an exceedance of chloride, nitrate, or
ammonium nitrogen is due to natural background or does not exceed the MCLs set
forth in
Table 16.56-1 and does not cause adverse health effects, the Zoning Enforcement
Officer may, after consultation with the Department of Health, waive the
requirement to resample the monitoring well within thirty (30) calendar days.
         d.   Corrective (Remedial) Action.
            (1)   Corrective action shall take place if a constituent is
detected at or above the groundwater quality standard level contained in
Table 16.56-1 or the background water quality is exceeded by three (3) standard
deviations. Corrective action shall include an inspection of the site by a
qualified professional hydrogeologist to evaluate and identify any potential
up-gradient, on-site, and down-gradient sources of contamination.
            (2)   Background water quality shall be established by sampling one
or more monitoring points at depths and locations sufficient to yield
groundwater samples that are representative of background water quality.
Background groundwater quality for indicator parameters shall be determined by
averaging a minimum of eight (8) sample results (over the normal two-year (2-
year) sample period) for each well. The Zoning Enforcement Officer, in
conjunction with the Department of Health, may exclude any sample result that
is non-representative of background water quality.
            (3)   Standard deviation for a group of samples is equal to the
square root of: the value of the sum of the squares of the difference between
each sample in the sample group and the mean for that sample group divided by
the number of samples in the sample group.
            (4)   Investigative and corrective action shall begin to take place
immediately upon receipt of reports which indicate contamination unless the
Zoning Enforcement Officer specifies in writing upon application of the owner
or operator wherein the owner or operator has demonstrated clearly to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer in conjunction with the Department of Health that
one of the following has occurred:
               (a)   The source of contamination is due to natural background.
               (b)   The detection resulted from error in sampling, analysis,
or evaluation.
            (c)   The contamination will not exceed the MCLs set forth in
Table 16.56-1, the contaminants do not cause adverse health effects, and all
actions have been undertaken to ensure the degree and extent of contamination
is reduced.
            (d)   The contamination is a result of contaminants remaining in
groundwater from a prior release for which corrective action was undertaken in
accordance with instructions from the appropriate agency.
            (e)   The contamination is from a release up-gradient of the
monitoring wells and is clearly not from any activities on the site.
         (5)   Corrective action shall be to remediate the contamination to
below the action levels established herein and to strive to re-establish
groundwater quality levels similar to up-gradient groundwater quality. The cost
of this remediation shall be borne by the party that caused the contamination
to be introduced. If it is determined that the contamination is a result of the
owner’s operation, the owner shall be responsible for the cost.

to a non-residential structure is limited to fifty percent (50%) of the length
of the structure’s longest side profile.
      4.   Appearance.
         a.   The turbine, tower, and blades shall be uniform in style and
finished in an unobtrusive neutral color, such as off-white, light grey, etc.
However, the blade components of a WES may be of a dark color to aid in de-
icing.
         b.   The required coloration and finish shall be maintained throughout
the life of the system.
         c.   Except for required warnings, and tower identification and system
manufacturer and system operator identification, no lettering, advertising, or
graphics on the WES is permitted.
         d.   Any attachments to the WES shall serve a critical operational
function and be as inconspicuous as function allows or approved as part of a

window of any habitable building of any nonparticipating property within five
hundred (500) feet for more than fifteen (15) minutes per day, unless the
applicant commits to a schedule for turning off the offending WES during these
periods.
         b.   New habitable buildings or new windows on existing habitable
buildings affected by shadow flicker shall not restrict the operation of a WES
or necessitate an alteration to a WES’s operation schedule, if they are
constructed after the WES has obtained all required permits for operation and
construction.
      7.   Sun Glint. The finish of WESs shall be flat or matte and non-
reflective to reduce the incidence of sun-glint.

§ 16.60.010 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   A.   Number of Principal Buildings on a Lot or Parcel.
      1.   In the agricultural and residential zoning districts, excluding the
R-2 and R-3 Districts, a maximum of one (1) dwelling unit is permitted per lot
or parcel. However, where allowed by the Ordinance, this does not apply to the
presence of an ancillary dwelling unit.
      2.   In the R-2 District, a maximum of one (1) residential structure
containing a maximum of two (2) dwelling units is permitted per lot or parcel.
However, where allowed by the Ordinance, this does not apply to the presence of
an ancillary dwelling unit.
      3.   In all other districts, multiple principal buildings may be erected
on a single lot or parcel provided that each building complies with all bulk
and setback requirements of the district. See §
16.56.030B.4.a. for additional rules for agricultural exempt structures.
      4.   The owner of a parcel may construct a replacement structure on the
same lot or parcel prior to the demolition of an existing structure, provided
that:
         a.   The replacement structure complies with all applicable bulk and
setback requirements of the district.
          b.   The property owner enters into a legally binding agreement with
the County stipulating that occupancy of the second structure is tied to a
demolition schedule for the first structure.
         c.   The property owner posts a letter of credit in the amount of one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the cost of demolition and removal of the first
structure, in a form approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. This letter of
credit may be redeemed by the County if the property owner defaults on the
agreement.
   B.   Frontage on a Public or Private Street. All lots and parcels shall
front on a public or private street.
   C.   Required Setbacks. Required setbacks are measured as the minimum
dimension required by a zoning district measured from the applicable lot lines
(see
Figure 16.60-1: Required Setbacks). Required setbacks are defined as follows:
      1.   The required street setback extends along the front and corner side
lot lines between the front, interior side, and rear lot lines, for the
required minimum depth specified by the zoning district in which the lot is
located, measured perpendicular to the applicable lot line.
Figure 16.60-1: Required Setbacks

IMAGES/0-0-0-2197.jpg]
 
         a.    For residential uses in the agricultural and residential zoning
districts, the minimum required street setback is established in
Table 16.36-1 . However, the required street setback may also be established by
either of the following alternate methods:
            (1)   The platted street setback.
            (2)   The average of the street setback of existing homes on the
same side of the blockface when sixty percent (60%) of the blockface is
developed. For blockfaces that extend more than six hundred (600) feet, only
parcels located within three hundred (300) feet of either side of the lot shall
be considered.
      In no case shall a street setback be reduced to less than ten (10) feet,
unless granted by a zoning variation.
      2.   The required interior side setback extends along an interior side
lot line between the front and rear setbacks, for the required minimum depth
specified by the zoning district in which the lot is located, measured
perpendicular to the interior side lot line.
         a.    On nonconforming lots or parcels of record, setbacks for single-
family dwellings and residential accessory structures may be reduced from the
setbacks established by the bulk and setback tables of this Ordinance, per §
16.80.050D. (Reduced Setbacks).
         b.    On lots or parcels with an interior side lot line that abuts a
body of water or waterway, principal and accessory structures are allowed a
zero-foot (0') waterfront setback, subject to the McHenry County Stormwater
Management Ordinance.
      3.   The required rear setback extends between the side lot lines for the
required minimum depth specified by the zoning district in which the lot is
located, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line.
         a.   On lots or parcels with a rear lot line that abuts a body of
water or waterway, principal and accessory structures are allowed a zero-foot
(0') waterfront setback, subject to the McHenry County Stormwater Management
Ordinance.
      4.   Permitted encroachments are described in
Table 16.60-1: Permitted Encroachments. An encroachment is the extension of an
attached accessory structure or architectural feature of a principal dwelling
into a required setback as listed in
Table 16.36-1: Zoning Districts Bulk and Setback Regulations or as allowed
under §
16.80.050D. (Reduced Setbacks).
         If the principal dwelling is a nonconforming structure, the amount it
encroaches into the required setback in
Table 16.36-1  is added to the allowed encroachment amount granted in
Table 16.60-1 . With the exception of accessibility ramps, encroachments shall
not result in an attached accessory structure or architectural feature being
constructed closer than ten (10) feet from a street lot line, fifteen (15) feet
from a corner side lot line, or five (5) feet from an interior side or rear lot
line. Encroachments into recorded easements are prohibited without the express
written permission of the easement holder(s) to which the easement is granted.

   D.   Effective Yards. An effective yard is the space located between a
structure and the adjoining lot lines. (See
Figure 16.60-2: Effective Yards.) In this Ordinance, certain accessory
structures are prohibited from locating within effective yards. The distinction
is made because certain principal buildings may be set back further than
required by district standards, thereby creating a yard larger than the minimum
required setback dimension.
      1.   The effective street yard extends from the closest point of the
front and corner side building lines of the principal building to the front and
corner side lot lines. A yard that abuts an alley is not an effective street
yard.
      2.   The effective interior side yard extends from the closest point of
the side of the principal building to the interior side lot.
      3.   The effective rear yard extends from the closest point of the rear
of the principal building to the rear lot line.

   E.   Contiguous Lots or Parcels. In the event that the construction of a
building or the establishment of a use requires multiple lots or parcels in
order to meet the lot area, setback, or lot or parcel dimensional requirements
of this Ordinance for the building or use, the lots or parcels shall be deed
restricted prior to construction of the building or establishment of the use
using County approved deed restriction language.
   F.   Building Height.
      1.   Principal Building Height.
         a.   Principal building height is measured as the vertical distance
from the average ground elevation to:
            (1)   The highest point of the coping of a flat roof.
            (2)   The deck line of a mansard roof.
            (3)   The mean height level that is located midway between the
eaves and ridge for gable, hip, or gambrel roofs.
         b.   Chimneys, architectural towers, spires, elevator penthouses,
cooling towers, and similar appurtenances are not included in calculating
building heights.
         c.   See §
16.56.050A. (Accessory Structures – General Regulations) for accessory
structure height limits.

      2.   Exempt Structures. The following structures or their appurtenances
are exempt from the height limitations within the zoning districts, unless
limited by height restriction imposed by an airport authority or similar agency
operating an airport, or other state or federal exemptions:
         a.   Agricultural buildings.
         b.   Bell towers.
         c.   Bulk storage towers and silos.

         h.   Smokestacks.
         i.   Towers and antennas, subject to the conditions of §§
16.56.030RR. and
16.56.030SS.
         j.   Water storage towers, tanks, and standpipes.
         k.   Wind energy systems, subject to the conditions of §
16.56.030TT.
         l.   Attached accessory structures, subject to the conditions of §
16.60.030.

§ 16.60.030 PERMITTED ENCROACHMENTS.
   A.   Purpose. The landscape and screening requirements are intended to
preserve and enhance the appearance, public health, safety, and welfare of the
County by fostering an aesthetically pleasing development. Proper landscape
contributes to the County in many ways: enhancing its character and scenic
beauty, providing clean air, reducing noise, preventing erosion of topsoil,
reducing the rate of stormwater runoff, providing nesting areas for birds and
habitat for other wildlife, conserving energy, and providing shade and
windbreaks. These regulations are also intended to increase the compatibility
of adjacent uses, and minimize the adverse impact of noise, dust, motor vehicle
headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable
activities or impacts conducted on, or created by, adjoining or neighboring
uses.
   B.   Applicability. The landscape and screening requirements established by
this Section apply to property in the commercial, office, and industrial zoning
districts. Property in the agricultural and residential zoning districts are
exempt. Landscape and screening standards must be met for buffer yards, refuse
storage areas, loading berths, and parking lot perimeters and interiors.
   C.   Enforcement of Landscape Provisions. No occupancy permit will be issued
for any structure, subject to the requirements of this Section, unless all the
requirements have been met. Failure to implement the landscape plan or to
maintain the lot or use in substantial conformance with the landscape plan is
cause for an enforcement action including the possible application of fines and
penalties, as established in this Ordinance. In addition, all landscape is
subject to periodic inspection.
      1.   If weather prohibits the installation of landscape at the time an
occupancy permit is applied for, the applicant can provide the County with a
letter of credit or cash in the amount required to complete landscape
installation in order to receive an occupancy permit, which will be returned
upon completion of required landscape.
      2.   Landscape materials depicted on approved landscape plans are
considered required site plan elements in the same manner as buildings, parking
and other improvements. As such, the owner or, if applicable, the homeowners
association is responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of all
landscape materials, and fences, steps, retaining walls, and similar landscape
elements over the entire life of the development.
      3.   All landscape materials shall be maintained in good condition,
present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and kept free of refuse and
debris. Unless an extension is granted due to weather, any dead, unhealthy, or
missing plants shall be replaced within thirty (30) days of notification by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer. Fences, steps, and retaining walls and similar
elements shall be maintained in good repair. The owner of the premises is
responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscape
materials, fences, steps, retaining walls and similar elements, and refuse
disposal areas. Irrigation systems, when provided, shall be maintained in good
operating condition.
   D.   Required Landscape Design Standards. Required landscape plans, as
described above, shall be evaluated and approved based on the following design
criteria.
      1.   The scale and nature of landscape materials shall be appropriate to
the size of the site and related structures.
      2.   Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color,
pattern of growth, and suitability to local conditions. Species shall be
considered for hardiness, year-round interest, color, habitat and food source
for birds and animals, and use in similar locations in other communities. Trees
with inappropriate root systems for an area or those generally not recommended
by landscape architects are not permitted.
      3.   All planting materials used shall be of good quality. The use of
species native to northeastern Illinois is encouraged. Size and density of
plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, should be
considered when selecting plant material. Where appropriate, the use of drought
and salt tolerant plant material is preferred.
      4.   All plant materials shall be free of disease and installed so that
soil of sufficient volume, composition, and nutrient balance are available to
sustain healthy growth.
      5.   Unless specified otherwise in this ordinance, trees and shrubs shall
be sized as follows at planting:
         a.   All deciduous shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of
three (3) inches in caliper at planting.
         b.   Evergreens trees shall have a minimum height of eight (8) feet at
planting.
         c.   Single stem ornamental trees shall have a minimum trunk size of
three (3) inches in caliper at planting. Multiple stem ornamental trees shall
have a minimum height of eight (8) feet at planting.
         d.   Unless otherwise specified, all large deciduous and evergreen
shrubs shall have a minimum height of three (3) feet at installation, and all
small deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall have a minimum height of eighteen
(18) inches at installation. Large shrubs are those that reach five (5) or more
feet in height at maturity. Small shrubs are those that can grow up to five (5)
feet in height if left unmaintained, but are generally kept at heights of
eighteen (18) to thirty (30) inches.
      6.   Species diversity in required plant material is required for visual
interest and to reduce the risk of losing a large population of plants due to
disease.
Table 16.60-2: Species Diversity indicates the of diversity required based on
the total quantity of species being used. (For example, if a landscape plan
requires 12 trees, a minimum of three tree species is required.)

   E.   Buffer Yards. This section establishes standards for the dimensions and
improvement requirements of buffer yards between land uses and/or zoning
districts within the rear or interior side yard. (See
Figure 16.60-5: Buffer Yard Landscape)
Figure 16.60-5: BUFFER YARD LANDSCAPE
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/38534809c61127d0edbdfc562dc063c115658fd8/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2205.jpg]
 
      1.   As of the effective date of this Ordinance, buffer yards are
required for new commercial or industrial construction or uses that abut a
property with an existing residential use in a residential zoning district or
the A-2 District, unless separated by a street or alley. When new commercial
construction locates next to an existing residential use, the new commercial
construction shall provide the buffer yard. If a new residential use locates
next to an existing commercial use, the existing commercial use is not required
to provide a buffer yard and is not considered nonconforming. Agricultural
buildings and uses are not required to provide buffer yards.
      2.   Buffer yards are required along the interior side and rear lot
lines. Buffer yards may be located within required setbacks, but shall be
reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as required
by this section. No parking, accessory buildings, or other structures are
permitted within the buffer yard area.
      3.   All plantings in the buffer yard shall meet the following standards:
         a.   The buffer yard planting area shall be a minimum of five (5) feet
in width in addition to the area provided for the required fence or wall.
         b.   Shade trees shall be planted on an average of one (1) tree for
every twenty-five (25) linear feet of yard length. As part of the landscape
plan approval, trees may be spaced at various intervals based on specific site
requirements or design scheme, but the total number of trees planted shall be
no less than the amount required by a linear planting spaced twenty-five (25)
feet apart.
         c.   An opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), solid fence, or
dense evergreen hedge, at least six (6) feet in height, is required along one
hundred percent (100%) of the yard length. The fence may be located on the
inside of the landscape plantings (adjacent to the non-residential use) or may
be located on the outside of the landscape plantings (adjacent to the existing
residential use in a residential zoning district or the A-2 District).
         d.   Shrubs shall be planted on an average of one (1) shrub for every
three (3) feet of yard length. As part of the landscape plan approval, shrubs
may be spaced at various intervals based on specific site requirements or
design scheme, but the total number of shrubs planted will be no less than the
amount required by a linear planting spaced three (3) feet apart.
   F.   Screening Requirements.
      1.   Refuse Disposal Dumpsters and Refuse Storage Areas. All refuse
containers shall be fully enclosed on three (3) sides by an opaque masonry wall
(stone, stucco or brick) or wall of the principal structure six (6) feet in
height, or a solid fence, and the enclosure shall be gated. The materials used
for screening, including the enclosure, shall complement the architecture of
the principal structure. An extension of an exterior principal structure wall
may be used as one of the screening walls for a refuse container, provided that
such wall meets the minimum six (6) foot height requirement and is of the same
building materials as the principal building. Such wall may not be the gated
enclosure.
      2.   Loading Berths. Where feasible, loading berths should be located and
oriented so as not be visible from the street and adjacent properties, while
still allowing access to the use it is serving. In addition, loading berths in
all zoning districts shall be screened from view, unless such screening is
determined unnecessary by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Such screening shall
consist of an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid fence, or
dense evergreen hedge, at least six (6) feet in height.
   G.   Parking Lot Landscape.
      1.   Applicability.
         a.   Interior parking lot landscape is required for new or expanded
parking facilities that consist of fifteen (15) or more paved spaces. This
Section applies whether the parking facilities are required to be paved by this
Ordinance or have been paved voluntarily.
         b.   Perimeter parking lot landscape is required for new or expanded
parking facilities within ten (10') feet of a right-of-way that consist of
fifteen (15) or more paved spaces. This Section applies whether the parking
facilities are required to be paved by this Ordinance or have been paved
voluntarily.
         c.   For existing parking lots in the commercial, office, and
industrial zoning districts that currently do not comply with the required
parking lot landscape standards, such landscape is required when a new
principal building is constructed or an existing building or use is expanded to
the extent that the parking lot is required to be expanded by fifty percent
(50%) or more.
         d.   Nothing in this Section prevents the applicant’s voluntary
installation of additional landscape.
      2.   Parking Lot Perimeter Landscape. Parking lot perimeter landscape
provides for the enhancement and screening of parking lots by requiring a
scheme of pedestrian walls and/or landscape along public streets. The landscape
treatment shall run the full length of the parking lot and be located between
the property line and the edge of the parking lot. Landscape areas outside of
shrub and tree masses shall be planted in live groundcover. (See
Figure 16.60-6: Parking Lot Perimeter Landscape.) The landscape area shall be
improved as follows:
         a.   The perimeter parking lot landscape area shall be at least five
(5) feet in width, as measured from the back of curb or wheelstop.
         b.   One (1) shrub, measuring a minimum of eighteen (18) inches at
planting and a minimum of three (3) feet at maturity, shall be planted for
every three (3) feet of landscape area length, spaced linearly to adequately
screen vehicle bumpers. Alternatively, a low pedestrian wall, the height of
which provides effective screening to a maximum height of three (3) feet, may
be used instead of shrubs.
         c.   All perimeter parking lot landscape areas shall be protected
through curbing or alternate designs to prevent damage to landscape from
vehicles. Protection designs that allow water to infiltrate into landscape are
encouraged.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2293.jpg]
 
      3.   Parking Lot Interior Landscape. (See
Figure 16.60-7: Interior Parking Lot Landscape)
         a.   Amount of Landscape. A minimum of one (1) parking lot island
shall be provided per every row of twenty (20) parking spaces, whether a single
row or double row of stalls. As part of the landscape plan approval, parking
lot island locations may be varied based on specific site requirements or
design scheme. All rows of parking spaces shall be terminated by a parking lot
island or landscape area.
         b.   Size and Planting of Parking Lot Islands. Parking lot islands
shall be the same width and depth as a parking stall. Double rows of parking
shall provide parking lot islands that are the same width and depth as the
double parking stall. A minimum of one (1) shade tree is required for every
parking lot island. If the island extends the width of a double row, then two
(2) shade trees are required. As an alternative to intermediate landscape
islands within rows of more than twenty (20) parking stalls, linear planting
strips that separate double rows of parking stalls and that serve as stormwater
swales are permitted. However, all rows of parking spaces shall be terminated
by a parking lot island or landscape area.
         c.   Type of Landscape Material. Shade trees shall be the primary
plant materials used in parking lot islands and landscape areas. Ornamental
trees, shrubs, hedges, and other plant materials may supplement the shade tree
plantings but cannot create visibility concerns for automobiles and
pedestrians.
         d.   Groundcover. A minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of every
parking lot island shall be planted in live groundcover, perennials, or
ornamental grasses.
         e.   Curbing. All parking lot islands shall be protected through
curbing or alternate designs to prevent damage to landscape from vehicles.
Protection designs that allow water to infiltrate into landscape are
encouraged.

§ 16.60.040 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   A.   Standards. All uses, except agricultural uses, shall be so operated so
as to comply with the performance standards described in this section. In
addition to these performance standards, all uses shall be constructed,
maintained, and operated as not to be injurious to the use and occupation of
the adjacent premises by reason of the emission or creation of noise,
vibration, radiation, fire and explosive hazard, or glare. All noise,
vibration, radiation, fire and explosive hazard, or glare shall conform to
local, state, and federal laws. Nothing in this section may be construed to
alter, change, modify or abrogate any authority granted exclusively to any
state or federal regulations.
   B.   Noise. Any activity or use shall be conducted wholly in compliance with
Title 9
Chapter 9.16 NOISE PROHIBITED of this McHenry County Code of Ordinances.
   C.   Heat. Any activity or the operation of any use that produces heat shall
be conducted so that no heat from the activity or operation is detectable at
any point off the lot on which the use is located.
   D.   Lighting and Glare.
      1.   All exterior lighting must meet the requirements of §
16.60.020 (Exterior Lighting).
      2.   Any commercial or industrial activity or operation that produces
glare or flickering of intense light sources shall be shielded, screened, or
conducted so that no glare from the activity or operation is detectable, and
flickering does not cause a nuisance, at any point off the lot or parcel on
which the use is located.
   E.   Dust and Air Pollution. Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by
the wind from sources, such as storage areas, yards, driveways and parking
areas, conveying equipment, and the like, within lot boundaries, shall be kept
to a minimum by appropriate landscape, screening, sheltering, paving, fencing,
wetting, collecting, or other acceptable means.
   F.   Discharge and Disposal of Radioactive and Hazardous Waste. The
discharge of fluid and the disposal of solid radioactive and hazardous waste
materials shall comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and
regulations governing such materials or waste. No operation that produces
radioactive or hazardous waste material may commence without prior notice to
the County. Notice shall be given at least three (3) weeks before the operation
is commenced. Radioactive and hazardous material waste shall be transported,
stored, and used in conformance with all applicable federal, state, and local
laws.
   G.   Odors. Any condition or operation which results in the creation of
odors of such intensity and character as to be detrimental to the health and
welfare of the public, or which interferes unreasonably with the comfort of the
public, shall be removed, stopped, or modified so as to remove the odor.
   H.   Toxic Substances. The storage, handling, or transport of toxic
substances shall comply with federal, state, and local regulations.

§ 16.60.050 STREET NAMING AND NUMBERING.
   A.   General.
      1.   Street names shall be assigned at the time of subdivision in
accordance with the standards of this section and shall be designated on the
recorded final plat as specified in §
16.76.070 (Subdivision Street Naming And Addressing).
      2.   Street numbers shall be assigned at the time of subdivision in
accordance with the standards of this section and shall be designated on the
recorded final plat as specified in §
16.76.070 (Subdivision Street Naming And Addressing).
      3.   Unplatted metes and bounds parcels will be assigned an address by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer at the time they are developed with a principal
structure. An address will consist of a number, based on §
16.60.050.C. (Address Numbering), and a street name, based on county records of
street names.
      4.   Assignment of a city name or ZIP code is the responsibility of the
U.S. Postal Service.
      5.   Only one address will be assigned to each lot or parcel with a
principal building. Additional address numbers will not be assigned when more
than one principal building or use is on a property, nor to accessory
structures. A property owner with multiple principal buildings or uses may
create and use additional addressing information, such letters or numbers for
suites, buildings, units, etc., so long as it is acceptable to the U.S. Postal
Service and the information is provided to the appropriate emergency response
agencies.
   B.   Street Naming. All streets shall be named and, in the case of branching
streets, the line of departure from one street to another shall be shown. Each
street shall have a unique name that is not a duplicate of any other in the
same or any adjoining McHenry County township. The use of streets with the same
name differentiated only by compass direction or by street type (i.e., street,
lane, court, road, circle, etc.) are prohibited. However, a loop-type road
needs only one street name for the entire loop.
   C.   Address Numbering. Even numbers are assigned to locations on the north
or east sides of all streets and roads, and odd numbers are assigned to all
locations on the south or west sides of all streets and roads.
   D.   Baselines. The street and road addressing system has two (2) baselines.
The first runs north and south along the east edge of the county bordering on
Lake County, Illinois. The second runs east and west across the county at the
north edges of Marengo, Seneca, Dorr, and Nunda Townships and therefore along
the south edges of Dunham, Hartland, Greenwood, and McHenry Townships.
   E.   Division of Miles into “Blocks” or Tenth-Mile Segments.
      1.   Each mile (section) out from the baseline will be divided into ten
(10) equal segments or blocks. The first block or tenth-mile (0.1-mile) segment
within that mile will be designated as the one hundred (100) block. Each block
will include five hundred and twenty-eight (528) feet of street or road
frontage if the road or street is perpendicular to the baseline.
      2.   The second block will be designated as the two hundred (200) block,
the third block as the three hundred (300) block, etc. through the tenth, which
will be the one thousand (1000) block.
   F.   Assigning Address Numbers to Property.
      1.   On roads and streets that are perpendicular to the baseline, a
number will be assigned to each fifty-two and eight-tenths (52.8) feet of each
tenth-mile (0.1-mile) segment except in cases of stores or similar situations
where each possible address would include less frontage.
      2.   More or fewer numbers should be used when necessary in order for
block numbering to change at cross roads or streets.
      3.   The smallest odd house number in a block will be one (1). The
smallest even house number will be two (2).
      4.   In cases where lots have more than fifty-two and eight-tenths (52.8)
feet of frontage, numbers will be omitted or skipped. In the case of lots with
one hundred (100) feet of frontage, for instance, every other number is used.
Consecutive numbers shall not be skipped arbitrarily.
      5.   Where a street or road runs at an angle or is curved, the first
consideration is whether it runs predominantly north and south or east and
west. It will then be numbered accordingly, and a number will be assigned to
each fifty (50) running feet of frontage on the street or road, and the block
number if changed upon crossing the tenth-mile (0.1-mile) segment.
      6.   Where a street or road in a subdivision makes a loop that intersects
with the same street, the numbers shall be continuous from one end to the
other.
   G.   First Mile Addresses.
      1.   Numbers will continue progressively so that normally final numbers
in the first mile and in the tenth-mile (0.1-mile) segment of that mile would
be 1019 and 1020.
      2.   On a curving and diagonal road or street, the numbers would continue
beyond 1019 and 1020 as needed.
   H.   Second Mile Addresses.
      1.   Numbers in the first block of the second mile from the baseline will
begin 1101 and 1102 and finish with 1119 and 1120.
      2.   Numbers in the second block will begin with 1201 and 1202 and
progress through each block or tenth-mile (0.1-mile) segment and until numbers
in the tenth block would normally end with 2019 and 2020.
   I.   Third through Tenth Mile Addresses. In the third mile from the
baseline, numbers will begin 2101 and 2102 and normally end with 3019 and 3020.
Addresses would progress in this way through the tenth mile, which would begin
with 9101 and 9102 through 10019 and 10020.

§ 16.64.020 GENERAL APPLICABILITY.
   A.   Existing Off-Street Parking Facilities. Parking facilities include
access, driveways, aisles, parking spaces, stacking spaces, bicycle parking,
loading spaces, and parking structures.
      1.   Existing uses shall not be required to provide additional parking to
meet the Ordinance requirements. The existing parking facilities may not be
reduced below the requirements of this Ordinance, without obtaining a variance.
If the existing parking facilities do not meet the requirements of this
Ordinance, it may not be further reduced, without obtaining a variance.
      2.   If a building permit was applied for prior to the effective date of
this Ordinance the number of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be
provided in the amount required for the issuance of said building permit,
regardless of the requirements of this Ordinance.
      3.   Parking facilities lost due to public roadway widening are not
required to be replaced and shall be deemed conforming for the existing use.
      4.   Existing unpaved parking may remain unpaved.
   B.   Additions or Expansions. When a use is increased through the addition
of a dwelling unit, floor area, seating capacity or other applicable unit of
measurement, off-street parking spaces and other parking facilities shall be
provided in proportion to that increased intensity. Deficiencies in the number
of parking spaces provided for the existing structure shall be allowed to
remain.
   C.   Change in Use. When a structure or land changes to a new use, the new
use shall meet the standards for parking facilities as required by this
Ordinance.
   D.   Prohibition on the Use of Off-Street Parking and Loading Spaces.
      1.   All parking spaces required by this Ordinance shall be used solely
for the parking of motor vehicles and bicycles, as required. No temporary or
permanent storage of vehicles for sale or hire is permitted. No required
parking or loading space may be used for outdoor storage, unless specifically
permitted by this Ordinance.
      2.   No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind is permitted in
any parking spaces.
      3.   No space allocated to any off-street loading space may be used to
satisfy the requirement for any off-street parking space or access aisle, or
portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street parking space
may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street loading space or
portion thereof.
   E.   Accessible Parking Requirements. With the exception of single-family
and two-family dwellings, all off-street parking facilities shall provide
parking spaces for disabled persons. The number of accessible parking spaces is
included in the total number of required parking spaces and shall be in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Accessibility Code,
as amended from time to time, and all additional governing codes and applicable
laws. Such spaces shall comply with the design standards presented in the
Illinois Accessibility Code and identified by a sign and pavement markings
indicating parking for the disabled only.

the same owner upon completion of a deed restriction.
   B.   In the commercial zoning districts, all parking lots and structures
shall be located on the same lot as or within four hundred (400) feet of the
use served. If the lot is a contiguous lot owned by the same owner, the parcels
shall be deed restricted. If the parcels are in separate ownership, cross
access easements shall be provided.
   C.   In the office or industrial zoning districts, parking facilities shall
be located on the same lot as or within six hundred (600) feet of the use
served. If the lot is a contiguous lot owned by the same owner, the parcels
shall be deed restricted. If the parcels are in separate ownership, cross
access easements shall be provided.
   D.   When a parking lot is not located on the same site as the use served, a
pedestrian pathway must be provided when located on the same side of the street
or a pedestrian crosswalk when located across the street.
(Ord. O-201410-10-035, passed 10-14-2014; Ord. O-201601-ZBA-006, passed 1-19-

§ 16.64.050 PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY.
   When a parking lot is not located on the same site as the use served, a
pedestrian pathway must be provided when located on the same side of the street
or a pedestrian crosswalk when located across the street.
(Ord. O-201803-ZBA-10-08, passed 3-19-2018; Ord. O-201808-10-033, passed 8-21-

§ 16.64.060 REQUIRED STACKING SPACES.
   Every drive-through facility and car wash shall provide a minimum of four
(4) stacking spaces per bay or lane, unless otherwise required by this
Ordinance. (See
Figure 16.64-2: Stacking Spaces) Stacking spaces shall be:
   A.   A minimum of nine (9) feet in width, as measured from the outermost
point of any service window to the edge of the driveway, and eighteen (18) feet
in length.
   B.   Placed in a single line leading to the drive-through facility.
   C.   Located so that, when in use, they do not obstruct ingress or egress to
the site and do not obstruct access to required parking or loading spaces.
   D.   Stacking spaces shall begin behind the vehicle parked at a last point
of service, such as a service window or car wash bay.

§ 16.64.070 COMPUTATION OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   The total number of required parking, loading and bicycle spaces is based
upon the requirements for the use of the lot. In computing the number of off-
street parking, loading, or bicycle spaces required by this Ordinance, the
following standards apply:
   A.   When more than one (1) principal use occupies the same lot or parcel or
structure, the number of required spaces is the sum of the separate
requirements for each use unless a collective parking alternative is used.
   B.   Uses ancillary to the main function of the principal use are not
subject to separate parking requirements. To be considered ancillary, such uses
shall be subordinate in square footage to the area for the principal use, shall
be supportive in function to the principal use, such as offices or eating
establishments for employees or patrons, and generally operate only during the
hours of operation of the principal use. The calculation used for the parking
requirement, such as gross floor area or maximum capacity, includes the area
for ancillary uses.
   C.   A fraction of a space is counted as one (1) parking or loading space.
   D.   In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches,
pews, or similar seating facilities, each twenty-four (24) inches of such
seating facility is counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of determining the
requirement for off-street parking facilities. Floor area of a prayer hall is
counted as one (1) seat per marked prayer mat space or one (1) seat for every
five (5) square feet in the prayer hall if prayer mat spaces are not marked.
   E.   Except as otherwise specified, parking or loading spaces required on an
employee basis is based on the maximum number of employees normally present on
the premises at any one time. When the determination of the number of parking
spaces is based on the number of employees, the owners and managers are counted
as employees.

§ 16.64.080 REQUIRED OFF-STREET VEHICLE PARKING.
   A.   The minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided for the
designated uses is as follows in
Table 16.64-1: Required Off-Street Parking.
Table 16.64-1 lists parking requirements for the uses listed within the
districts. In some cases, uses that are considered part of a generic use
category are listed with specific parking requirements. These specific uses are
listed only for the purposes of this section and do not indicate whether such
uses are permitted or conditional uses within any district. Any use not listed
within
Table 16.64-1 will have a parking requirement of one (1) space per five hundred
(500) square feet of gross floor area.
   B.   In any parking lot of twenty (20) or more spaces, one (1) space
designed, reserved, and designated for a motorcycle shall be provided for each
twenty (20) automobile spaces up to a maximum of five (5) motorcycle spaces.
Motorcycle parking spaces shall have minimum dimensions of four (4) feet by
seven (7) feet and do not count as parking spaces for the purpose of this
Ordinance.
   C.   Parking for multi-tenant shopping or strip centers is calculated as
three (3) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of gross floor area,
rather than by the individual uses.

§ 16.64.090 PERMITTED PARKING ALTERNATIVES.
   A.   Collective Parking. Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be
provided collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less
than the sum of the spaces required in
Table 16.64-2: Collective Parking Calculation.
Table 16.64-2 is applied in the following manner:
      1.   The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according
to
Table 16.64-1: Required Off-Street Parking.
      2.   The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the
percentages for each time, according to the appropriate land use category, in
Table 16.64-2 to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each
time category.
      3.   The numbers are sum for all land uses within each time category and
the highest sum total in a time category is the required number of spaces.

      4.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may approve the provision of fewer
collective parking spaces based on specific data regarding the hours of
operation and parking demands of the individual uses.
      5.   The users of the collective parking arrangement record an agreement
to share parking facilities and cross access easements, subject to approval by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer. A copy of the recorded agreement and cross
access easements shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
      6.   The off-site parking facilities are located within six hundred (600)
feet of the lot line of the use or structure served.
   B.   Land Banked Future Parking. Land banking allows for designating a
portion of land on a site that would be required for parking to be held and
preserved as open space, rather than constructed as parking. The land banking
of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the required parking spaces may be
approved through the site plan review process, subject to the following.
      1.   Sufficient evidence is provided by the applicant that supports the
reduced parking needs.
      2.   The area proposed for land banking of parking spaces shall be an
area suitable for parking at a future time.
      3.   Landscape of the land banked area shall be in full compliance of the
zoning regulations and, at a minimum, landscaped with live groundcover.
Additional landscape may be required.
      4.   The land banked area cannot be used for any other use and shall be
part of the same zoning lot and all under the same ownership.
      5.   As part of the site plan review process, the applicant shall show
the area to be banked on the site plan and marked as “Land Banked Future
Parking.”
      6.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer, based on evidence that the provided
parking is insufficient to meet the parking demand for the use, may require the
construction of all or part of the required parking within the land banked
area.
   C.   Cross-Access Easements.
      1.   Adjacent non-residential uses that possess dedicated parking areas
are encouraged to provide a cross-access drive to allow circulation between
sites. Property owners are required to pursue cross-access with neighboring
property owners at the time of site plan review. If cross-access will not be
provided, the County shall require that the property owner provide proof that
adjacent property owners have been contacted in writing regarding the provision
of cross-access. (See
Figure 16.64-3: Cross-Access Easement)

      2.   Joint use driveways and cross-access easements shall incorporate the
following:
         a.   A minimum width of twenty-four (24) feet to ensure two-way travel
aisles to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles, and loading vehicles.
         b.   Bump-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious
that the abutting properties are tied together.
         c.   A unified access and circulation plan for coordinated or shared
parking areas.
      3.   Pursuant to this section, property owners who establish cross-access
easements shall:
         a.   Record an easement allowing cross-access to and from properties
served by the joint use driveways and cross-access easement.
         b.   Record a joint maintenance agreement defining the maintenance
responsibilities of each property owner.
   D.   On-Street Parking. On-street parking spaces are those that are within a
road right-of-way. They may be substituted for required off-street parking when
located in a Legacy Neighborhood Overlay District, on a street with a posted
speed limit of thirty-five (35) miles-per-hour or less, and not prohibited by
the applicable road jurisdiction(s), which may have additional requirements.

§ 16.64.100 REQUIRED OFF-STREET BICYCLE PARKING.
   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may vary or waive the Off-Street Bicycle
Parking requirements if bicycle access to the site is determined to be
impractical or unsafe.
   A.   Design.
      1.   Bicycle parking facilities shall provide racks to which the bicycle
may be locked by the user, or enclosed lockers. Structures that require a user-
supplied locking device shall be designed to accommodate U-shaped locking
devices.
      2.   If required bicycle parking facilities are not visible from the
street, signs shall be posted indicating their location.
      3.   Areas used for required bicycle parking shall be paved and drained
to be reasonably free of mud, dust, and standing water, and shall be well-lit.
   B.   Location.
      1.   All required bicycle spaces shall be located on the same lot as the
use served and shall be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
      2.   Required bicycle parking for multifamily dwellings may be provided
in garages, storage rooms, and other resident-accessible, secure areas. Space
within dwelling units or on balconies may not be counted toward satisfying
bicycle parking requirements.
   C.   Required Number of Bicycle Spaces.
      1.   Where off-street parking facilities are provided, the number of
bicycle parking spaces shall be provided as indicated in
Table 16.64-3: Required Bicycle Spaces.

§ 16.72.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a framework for a comprehensive
system of sign controls governing the display, design, construction,
installation, and maintenance of signs that will:
   A.   Promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the County by
ensuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses.
   B.   Support and encourage the business and economic climate by enhancing
and protecting the orderly and effective display of signs.
   C.   Encourage signs that communicate effectively without detracting from
the scenic beauty of the countryside.
   D.   Protect the public from hazardous conditions that result from the
indiscriminate use and placement of signs, structurally unsafe signs, signs
that obscure the vision of pedestrians or motorists, and signs that compete or
conflict with necessary traffic signals and warning signs.

§ 16.72.040 LOCATION.
   A.   This ordinance does not regulate the installation or maintenance of
signs by public agencies within the right-of-way of a public street or highway
or on public property.
   B.   Any sign placed within the right-of-way of any public street or highway
or on public property without authorization may be removed without notice and
disposed of by the local authority having jurisdiction over the street,
highway, or property, unless the sign is permitted to be placed on public
property by State laws including, but not limited to, the Illinois Election
Code and/or 10 ILCS 5/1-1 et seq. as enforced by State Board of Elections or

§ 16.72.050 SIGN DIMENSION COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principles control the computation of sign dimensions. (See
Figure 16.72-2: Measurement of Sign Area,
Figure 16.72-3: Computation of Sign Angle for Sign Area, and
Figure 16.72-4: Measurement of Sign Height)
   A.   Computation of Sign Area.
      1.   For signs on a background, the entire area of the background is
calculated as sign area, including any material or color forming the sign face
and the background used to differentiate the sign from the structure against
which it is mounted. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing (see
Figure 16.72-2).
      2.   For signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, the sign area
is calculated as the total area of each square, circle, rectangle or triangle,
or combination thereof, that encompasses each individual letter or logo. Sign
area does not include any supports or bracing (see
Figure 16.72-2).
      3.   The sign area of a three-dimensional, free-form, or sculptural (non-
planar) sign is calculated as fifty percent (50%) of the sum of the area of the
four vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign (see
Figure 16.72-2).
      4.   If the interior angle between two (2) sign faces is forty-five
degrees (45°) degrees or less, the sign area is computed as the area of one (1)
face only. If the angle between two (2) sign faces is greater than forty-five
degrees (45°), the sign area is computed as the sum of the areas of the two (2)
faces (see
Figure 16.72-3).
   B.   Measurement of Sign Height. For freestanding signs, height is
calculated as the vertical distance measured from the grade of the site where
the sign is to be installed or the grade of the roadway, whichever is higher,
to the highest point of the sign. Grade is considered the lower of the existing
grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction
(see
Figure 16.72-4).

passed 3-19-2018; Ord. O-201808-10-033, passed 8-21-2018)
§ 16.72.060 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   A.   Construction. All signs that require a sign permit shall comply with
the provisions of this Article and the requirements of the building codes
adopted by the County.
   B.   Illumination.
      1.   All sign illumination must be fully shielded, and located and
directed to prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon roadways and
surrounding properties.
      2.   The sign face of internally illuminated signs must function as a
filter (i.e., prevent the direct exposure of any internal bulbs) for any
illumination.
      3.   All external illumination must concentrate the illumination upon the
printed area of the sign face.
      4.   The lighting intensity of any non-digital sign, whether internally
or externally illuminated, is limited to a maximum of sixty (60) footcandles
when measured with a standard light meter held at a distance of ten (10) inches
from the sign face. The lighting intensity of digital signs is regulated under
§
16.72.050C.5. (Digital Sign Message Controls) below.
   C.   Digital Sign Message Controls.
      1.   Each message or image displayed on a digital sign must be static and
depicted for a minimum of ten (10) seconds before changing.
      2.   Blinking, flashing, scrolling, or strobe-light effects are
prohibited.
      3.   Animation and/or streaming video of any type is prohibited.
      4.   A digital sign shall not be utilized to display an off-premises
commercial advertising message without obtaining a conditional use permit for
an off-premises commercial advertising sign as required by §
16.56.030EE. (Off-Premises Commercial Advertising Sign).
      5.   A digital sign must not exceed a maximum illumination of three-
tenths (0.3) footcandles above the ambient light level when measured from a
distance equal to the square root of the square footage of the sign multiplied
by one hundred (100). (Measurement distance = sign area x 100). All digital
signs must have ambient light monitors installed, which automatically adjust
the brightness level based on ambient light conditions.
      6.   In response to complaints, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may
require that the owner of a digital sign submit a certification demonstrating
that the sign complies with the maximum illumination standards.
      7.   All digital signs must be programmed to automatically revert to a
full black screen in the event of a malfunction.

   D.   Audio. No sign may emit sounds, including recorded messages and/or
music.
   E.   Glass. Glass forming any part of a sign shall be safety glass, with the
exception of neon.
   F.   Lettering. All letters, figures, characters, or representations in cut-
out or irregular form, maintained in conjunction with, attached to, or
superimposed upon any sign shall be safely and securely built or attached to
the sign structure.
   G.   Identification Tag. Every sign or other advertising structure shall
display the identification tag provided by the County, in a conspicuous place.
   H.   Sign and Premises Maintenance.
      1.   All signs, and the premises surrounding the sign, shall be
maintained in a clean and safe condition.
      2.   If a sign is unsafe, unsecure, or erected or maintained in violation
of the provisions of this Ordinance, the Zoning Enforcement Officer will give
written notice to the sign permit holder. If sign permit holder fails to remove
or alter the sign to comply with the standards of this Ordinance within 14
calendar days, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may order the sign removed at the
property owner’s expense in accordance with the enforcement provisions of this
Ordinance. The County may remove, without notice, any other sign that is an
immediate peril to persons or property.

§ 16.76.020 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   All federal, state, county, and other official benchmarks, monuments
and triangulation stations in or adjacent to a proposed subdivision shall be
preserved. When a proposed improvement in a subdivision makes it necessary to
move a benchmark, monument, or triangulation station, the authority having
jurisdiction shall be notified and given sufficient time to take appropriate
action.
   B.   All dimensions, linear, curvilinear, and angular, necessary to properly
re-survey, shall be shown with linear dimensions in feet and decimals of a
foot.
   C.   Monumentation shall be in accordance with the procedures and
requirements of the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/).
   D.   The design of each subdivision shall take into consideration the
capabilities and limitations of topography, drainage, soils, erosion potential,
and other features of the site.
   E.   The subdivision wastewater conveyance and treatment systems shall
comply with the McHenry County Public Health Ordinance. Sites utilizing
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) permitted technology shall
conform to all of the requirements of the IEPA and receive all applicable
permits.
   F.   The subdivision potable water supply systems shall comply with the
McHenry County Public Health Ordinance and applicable state laws. Sites
utilizing IEPA permitted technology shall conform to all of the requirements of
the IEPA and receive all applicable permits.
   G.   Secure and permanent funding arrangements shall be established for the
long-term management and maintenance of common open space, deed-restricted open
space, and stormwater facilities once said responsibilities are turned over to
a public agency, private land conservation organization, or homeowners/property
owners association. Said funding arrangements shall be noted and made part of
the covenants and restrictions. A management entity with demonstrated
experience and qualifications in natural land management and ecologic
stewardship shall be utilized to perform short- and long-term management
responsibilities for open space and natural areas. The entity may be a public
or private land conservation organization or a professional natural land
management specialist or company.
   H.   A back-up special service area (SSA) is required to provide funds
necessary to support the maintenance and upkeep of site elements to be
maintained by and the responsibility of a homeowners association, such as
sidewalks, open space, and stormwater management areas. The back-up SSA shall
be established and detailed in the covenants and restrictions as a condition of
the final plat. The back-up SSA shall give the County Board the ability to levy
an ad valorem special tax against all taxable property within the proposed SSA
in order to fund necessary maintenance, program administration, and other
associated costs. The subdivider shall submit to the Staff Plat Review
Committee a fully-executed SSA ordinance.
      1.   Upon receipt, the Department of Planning and Development will submit
the ordinance to the County Board for its consideration.
      2.   In the event the County Board adopts the proposing ordinance, a
public hearing, which must be noticed in accordance with §
16.16.030 (Notice), shall be held not less than sixty (60) days from the date
of adoption, pursuant to the Special Service Area Tax Law (35 ILCS 200/27-30-
35).
      3.   The County Board will consider and vote upon the establishment of
the SSA.
   I.   Certain residential subdivisions are subject to the requirements for
conservation design. Section
16.76.030 (Conservation Design Triggers) describes those factors that trigger
the required use of conservation design. In addition, when the triggers do not
apply, an applicant may choose to subdivide their property in accordance with
the conservation design requirements. An applicant shall verify that the
subject property is not required to undertake conservation design at the time
of application for subdivision. A property owner may object to the designation
of land as requiring conservation design by demonstrating, through the
submittal of an analysis prepared by competent experts, to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, that the property does not meet the triggers for
conservation design. If the Zoning Enforcement Officer concurs with the
evaluations submitted by the applicant, the conservation design is not
required. The County may seek independent expert opinion regarding the analysis
and conclusions.

§ 16.76.030 CONSERVATION DESIGN TRIGGERS.
   Subdivision of land resulting in five (5) or fewer residential lots is
exempt from required conservation design. In all other residential
subdivisions, conservation design is required when the development site meets
specified individual or cumulative triggers. For the purpose of determining the
presence of cumulative triggers, the area of analysis shall include the
property to be subdivided along with a buffer area extending two hundred (200)
feet around the property. Conservation design is required when:
   A.   The site contains or abuts within one hundred (100) feet a designated
McHenry County Natural Area Inventory (MCNAI) site.
   B.   The site contains or abuts within one hundred (100) feet a stream,
river, lake, and/or wetland designated as Advanced Identification (ADID) high
habitat value or high quality.
   C.   When the cumulative acreage contained by the following resources equals
or exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the total area of the area of analysis (as
described above):
      1.   Wetlands, except farmed wetlands.
      2.   Floodplains and flood of record areas.
      3.   Glacial kettle holes.
      4.   Woodlands and savannas based on on-site determination.
      5.   Remnant prairies based on on-site determination.
      6.   Soils characterized as having one (1) or more of the following
characteristics:
         a.   Soils identified as “E” slopes and greater, reflecting highly
erodible slopes of twelve percent (12%) and greater as defined in Soil Survey
Legend, Soil Survey of McHenry County, Illinois, USDA-NRCS, 2002.
         b.   Soils identified as Depressional hydric soils based on a coverage
developed by NRCS using the USDA-NRCS Hydric Soil List, McHenry County:
Detailed Soil Map Legend, 12/03/2003.
      7.   State-designated “Class III Special Resources Groundwater Areas.”
      8.   Aquifer recharge areas as identified in the SARA Map.
      9.   Publicly owned or private deed-restricted natural open spaces and
preserves.
      10.   Green infrastructure area as identified in the McHenry County Green
Infrastructure Plan. Green infrastructure area beyond the property but within
the two hundred-foot (200') buffer is excluded from the calculation.

requirements of the zoning district standards of this Ordinance, unless
specifically permitted otherwise by conservation design standards.
   B.   A minimum lot frontage as required by the zoning district, unless
otherwise specified under conservation design standards.
   C.   All lots shall front directly upon and take access from a road that is
presently, or will be upon completion of the subdivision, publicly dedicated
and maintained. The road system of the subdivision shall exit directly upon a
dedicated road publicly maintained or a road that, upon completion of the
subdivision, will be publicly maintained.
   D.   Every lot created by subdivision shall be substantially similar in
shape to those lots on the same block, unless the contours of an adjacent
street or previously established lot render such shape impractical. Every lot
or parcel of land that is subdivided shall contain a relatively straight
boundary line between each lot.

§ 16.76.050 RIGHT-OF-WAY DESIGN.
   A.   General Requirements.
      1.   The subdivider shall construct all roads and streets shown on the
plat in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
      2.   All roads created by a subdivision shall be shown on the plat as
dedicated to public use. Private roads are prohibited.
      3.   The local township highway commissioner, County Engineer, or
representative who will take responsibility for maintaining the facility after
final acceptance shall be referred to as the “local jurisdictional agency.”
      4.   All roadway design requirements shall comply with the applicable
sections of the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) Bureau of Local
Roads and Streets (BLRS) Manual and the IDOT Bureau of Design and Environment
(BDE) Manual.
      5.   All road right-of-way construction shall be done in accordance with
and the latest edition of the following State of Illinois specifications: “The
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction” (referred to as the
“Standard Specifications”), the “Supplemental Specifications and Recurring
Special Provisions”, the “Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets
and Highways”, the “Manual of Test Procedures for Materials”, the “Highway
Standards” and the “Bureau of Design and Environment Special Provisions”.
Further, the following Region 1 District 1 requirements shall apply: the
“District One Special Provisions” and the “District One Details”.
   B.   General Roadway Design.
      1.   The maximum length for a block between intersecting roads is one
thousand two hundred (1,200) feet.
      2.   The use of cul-de-sacs and eyebrow streets are prohibited, unless
all of the following standards are met:
         a.   It is determined necessary by, and approval is received in
writing from, the applicable township highway commissioner.
         b.   It avoids impacts to sensitive environmental resources as
identified in the site inventory or it avoids street designs that allow cut
through traffic between arterial streets.
      3.   Road access to adjacent properties and direct connection with
existing abutting public road right-of-way in adjoining subdivisions is
required, except in the following situations:
         a.   Written approval is received from the applicable township highway
commissioner that such interconnection is not required.
         b.   Written approval is received from the County Engineer that such
interconnection is not required, if the subdivision fronts or has access to a
County highway.
         c.   It avoids impacts to sensitive environmental resources as
identified in the site inventory or it avoids street designs that allow cut
through traffic between arterial streets.
      4.   Road access (i.e., stub streets) to adjacent vacant properties shall
be located in a manner that will allow for the connection to the adjacent
vacant parcel without conflicting with resources as identified in the site
inventory.
   C.   General Functional Classification Categories. The following identifies
the basic characteristics of the three general categories within the functional
classification system as outlined in the IDOT BLRS Manual:
      1.   Arterial. Arterial highways are generally characterized by their
ability to quickly move relatively large volumes of traffic, but often with
restricted accessibility to abutting properties. The arterial system typically
provides for high travel speeds and the longest trip movements. The rural and
urban arterial systems are connected to provide continuous through movements at
approximately the same level of service.
      2.   Collector. Collector routes are characterized by a relatively even
distribution of access and mobility functions. Traffic volumes and speeds are
typically lower than those of arterials.
      3.   Local. All public roads and streets not classified as arterials or
collectors are classified as local roads and streets. The many points of direct
access to adjacent properties characterize local roads and streets. Speeds and
volumes are usually low and trip distances short.
   D.   Road Design Standards.
      1.   Grade. The maximum grade for collector streets and streets of higher
classifications shall not exceed four percent (4%). The maximum grade for local
streets shall not exceed six percent (6%). The maximum grade for all driveways
continuing outside of the right-of-way shall not exceed eight percent (8%)
unless written approval is obtained from the local jurisdictional agency. The
minimum grade of all streets shall be four-tenths percent (0.4%).
      2.   Geometrics. Street geometrics shall conform to the design standards
established in the IDOT BLRS Manual. Streets shall be designed on the basis of
the following design speeds:
         a.   Collector street: Fifty (50) miles per hour.
         b.   Local streets: Thirty (30) miles per hour.
      3.   Horizontal Curvature. Angles on the centerlines of streets shall not
be permitted except at intersections. Centerline radii shall be as follows:
         a.   Collector streets: Shall conform to standards set by the IDOT
BLRS Manual.
         b.   Local streets: One-hundred-foot (100') minimum.
      4.   Vertical Curvature. Vertical curves shall be required at all
locations where the algebraic difference of grade is one percent (1%) or
greater. Vertical curves shall be designed as follows:
         a.   Collector streets: Shall conform to standards set by the BLRS
Manual.
         b.   Local streets: Crest vertical curves shall be designed with a
minimum K value of thirty (30). Sag vertical curves shall be designed with a
minimum K value of fifty (50). In no case shall a vertical curve at a street

to assure that construction of the engineering improvements is accomplished in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
      3.   During construction of streets with curb and gutter, the subdivider
shall not be allowed to partially install pavement below the gutter elevation
during construction operations. The subdivider shall be required to maintain
positive drainage throughout construction and install pavement up to the
finished gutter elevation on a temporary basis. A temporary cross slope of less
than two percent (2%) is allowable during construction operations to match the
gutter elevation. At the conclusion of construction, the subdivider shall
remove the appropriate thickness of the pavement surface in order to establish
the final approved cross-section of the roadway.
      4.   The subdivider is responsible for maintaining and repairing all
roads in the subdivision until the roads are accepted by the appropriate
authority. Maintenance includes snow plowing, which shall ensure ingress and
egress to all lots that have been sold. Failure to ensure adequate ingress and
egress is cause for withholding of building permits and the approval of
additional units of the development.
      5.   Subdivision roads will not be accepted by the local jurisdictional
agency until all construction detailed in the plans is completed. It is the
responsibility of the subdivider to consult with the local jurisdictional
agency before the work has begun to afford the local jurisdictional agency an
opportunity to inspect the work as construction progresses.
      6.   When roadside drainage facilities include Class V injection wells,
adequate precaution shall be taken to insure against siltation of the Class V
injection wells until protective vegetation has become established in the

acceptable means to maintain all easements.
   A.   Utility Easements. Easements shall be provided for utility services
including, but not limited to, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water, gas,
telecommunication, cable television, and electric. The location of a utility
easement is determined by the appropriate utility company, with the exception
of utility easements for properties that front on a county highway. In such
case, a utility easement running the full length of the County highway frontage
is required outside of, but immediately adjacent to, the County highway right-
of-way. Such easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width and the
plat shall include notes to indicate that such easements are provided for
utility services. The developer shall provide underground utilities unless
specific site conditions make the installation of underground utilities
impractical.
   B.   Stormwater Management Easements. When a subdivision is traversed by a
waterway, intermittent stream or drainage way, a stormwater easement shall be
provided conforming substantially with the lines of same. Such easement shall
be of sufficient size to protect said waterway, intermittent stream or drainage
way, and to permit ingress and egress for maintenance. Such easement shall meet
the requirements of the Stormwater Management Ordinance and shall be shown on
the recorded final plat.
      1.   An on-site wastewater treatment system restriction line shall be
shown in conjunction with each stormwater management easement demarcation line,
in accordance with the Public Health Ordinance.
      2.   Drainage and stormwater retention and detention easements shall be
adequately maintained to provide for removal of accumulation of vegetation,
silt, debris, or other material which may interfere with the flow
characteristics of drainage ways or the essential features of retention or
detention facilities. In subdivisions of five (5) lots or more, all stormwater
detention/retention areas shall be platted as a separate outlot that is not
part of an individual building lot, and owned and maintained by a homeowners
association, property owners association, approved open space management
entity, or government agency.
      3.   No construction of structures, dams, embankments, or channels,
except as indicated on the engineering drawings, and no planting of trees,
shrubbery or other flow-impeding vegetation, or solid fences that hinders the
flow of water or otherwise inhibits the intended purpose, are permitted within
any drainage or stormwater retention or detention easements.
   C.   Buffer Area Easement. When a subdivision contains a linear or non-
linear water body including channels, lakes, ponds, and wetland, as defined by
the Stormwater Management Ordinance, or when a subdivision is located in
proximity to such a linear or non-linear water body located on an adjacent
property, a buffer area easement shall be provided as required by the
Stormwater Management Ordinance
   D.   Pedestrian Way Easements. Pedestrian way easements shall be provided
where appropriate. Pedestrian ways shall be maintained to permit their
continued use. A pedestrian way maintenance plan shall be provided with the

§ 16.76.090 CONSERVATION DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, subdivisions that
trigger and subdivisions that voluntarily choose conservation design shall
comply with the following standards.
   A.   General Requirements.
      1.   The proposed development shall be designed to fit the topography,
physical features, and soil conditions of the subject site. More specifically,
conservation design shall preserve natural drainage patterns, stabilize soils
during construction, preserve native vegetation, and protect, enhance, and
maintain natural resources.
      2.   It is recommended that the applicant undertake the optional pre-
application conference and present a concept plan that identifies all natural
resources, conservation areas, open space areas, and physical features, as
referenced in §
16.76.030 (Conservation Design Triggers). To the maximum extent practical,
these features shall be preserved as open space and protected from negative
impacts generated as a result of the development or other land disturbing
activities.
      3.   Building sites shall be located to take advantage of open space and
scenic views. Lots shall be designed to facilitate the access within
neighborhoods and to open space and conservation areas.
      4.   The street network shall be designed to minimize encroachment into
natural resources, conservation areas, open space areas, and physical features,
as identified in §
16.76.030 (Conservation Design Triggers), and to take advantage of open space
vistas.
      5.   Earth grading shall be minimized. The subdivider is required to
submit a site plan that delineates where soils will not be disturbed as the
result of earthwork, grading, or other construction activities.
   B.   Open Space Requirement.
      1.   Qualifying Open Space. The minimum requirement for open space, as
required by conservation design standards, shall be maintained in common open
space. Qualifying open space shall be generally maintained in an undeveloped
state. Qualifying open space includes, but is not limited to, the following:
         a.   Woods and savannas.
         b.   Wetlands and wetland buffers.
         c.   Streams, waterways, lakes, and ponds.
         d.   Prairies and grasslands.
         e.   Floodplains and flood prone areas, provided that they are
maintained as other qualifying open space types on this list.
         f.   Naturally landscaped areas.
         g.   Walking, bicycle, or equestrian trails.
         h.   Naturally landscaped stormwater detention and drainage
facilities.
         i.   Areas utilized for installation of water wells, spray irrigation
of treated wastewater, excluding treatment and associated wastewater storage
facilities, and on-site wastewater treatment systems, excluding septic tanks or
other pre-treatment devices and lift stations, provided that they are
maintained as other qualifying open space types on this list.
         j.   Areas of greater than twelve percent (12%) slope.
         k.   Pasture and agricultural cropland areas, orchards, community
gardens, apiaries, and hen houses.
         l.   Manicured turf grass areas such as those on golf courses,
playgrounds, and recreational fields, which are limited to ten percent (10%) of
the total area of required open space.
         Qualifying areas do not include parkways, landscape islands, sign
easements, berms, or similar installed landscape features. In addition, roads,
driveways, parking lots, and rights-of-way do not count towards fulfilling open
space requirements. The required perimeter buffer yard may be counted if it is
comprised of the resources to be protected as identified in §
16.76.030 (Conservation Design Triggers).
      2.   Open Space Standards.
         a.   Where feasible, degraded remnant natural areas shall be restored
to a natural state that will require only routine ecologic management.
         b.   The layout of the development shall be designed to minimize any
negative impacts to abutting land with significant natural areas and resources.
Buffers shall be provided against natural areas on adjacent properties, and
existing wildlife corridors and sensitive ecosystems preserved.
         c.   Open space shall be preserved in large contiguous areas.
         d.   The open space shall be designed to facilitate easy access from
all streets and neighborhoods within the development. Open space shall be
interconnected with greenways and, if applicable, trail systems both within the
development site and connecting to adjacent subdivisions and to local and
regional trails.
         e.   Open space shall be dedicated as common open space to be jointly
owned by a qualified governmental body, conservation agency, homeowners
association, or property owners association.
         f.   Required open space areas cannot be enclosed with man-made
fencing, with the exception of areas containing natural or cultural features
that require special protection and agricultural and equestrian pastures and
trails.
         g.   Required open space areas shall be maintained in perpetuity.
         h.   Required open space areas cannot be improved with any structures
or other development. However, the County may approve certain structures that
will not negatively impact the natural and open space areas. These exceptions
include, but are not limited to, picnic shelters, viewing stands, interpretive
signs, and benches. These structures shall be compatible with open space uses.
A sign easement may be located in an open space area, however areas dedicated
for sign easements are not included in the calculation of required open space.
Agricultural exempt structures are allowed in open space areas that are
utilized for agricultural purposes; however, areas used by agricultural exempt
structures as well as substantially disturbed areas located adjacent or between
agricultural exempt structures are not included in the calculation of required
open space.
         i.   Permanent boundary signs shall be installed to delineate open
space from private property. Placement of signs shall be determined at
preliminary plat stage.
      3.   Perimeter Buffer Yard. A minimum fifty-foot (50') width perimeter
buffer yard, designated as an outlot(s), shall be maintained around the
exterior of the development on all sides. The buffer is measured from the road
right-of-way or adjacent exterior property line of the development, as
appropriate. This buffer shall be designed to screen new housing or
incompatible development, preserve scenic views, or otherwise enhance the
landscape as seen from existing perimeter roads. A trail or sidewalk may be
constructed within the perimeter buffer. Landscaped berms and entrance signs
are allowed in buffers, and roads may cross the buffer.
      4.   Open Space Prohibitions. Use of open space that conflicts with
conservation purposes are prohibited. Prohibitions shall be identified in and
enforced through the subdivision covenants. The following activities are
prohibited, unless allowed by the approved stewardship plan:
         a.   Dumping of grass clippings, yard waste, debris or other
objectionable material.
         b.   Storage of material, vehicles, etc.
         c.   Removal of native vegetation or trees.
         d.   Introduction of exotic plant species.
         e.   Manipulation or alteration of natural watercourses or wetlands.
         f.   Filling, grading, drilling, removal of soil or other natural
materials, or dredging.
         g.    Water wells and on-site wastewater treatment systems.
      5.   Open Space Ownership and Funding Requirements.
         a.   Dedicated open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a
binding conservation easement or similar binding legal instrument recorded with
the McHenry County Recorder and granted to one (1) or more of the following
entities, which will be responsible for all maintenance, control, and insurance
of common areas, including dedicated open space areas. The ultimate owner of
open space, as well as the entity responsible for maintaining it, shall be
identified and made part of the conservation design covenants and restrictions.
            (1)   A public agency whose primary purpose is open space
management is the preferred option.
            (2)   A private land conservation organization whose primary
purpose is the preservation and maintenance of conservation areas, natural
resources, or agricultural resources is the second preferred option.
            (3)   A homeowners or property owners association, if it is not
practical or appropriate for a public agency or private land conservation
organization to accept responsibility. If ownership resides with the
homeowners/property owners association, membership in the HOA/POA shall be
mandatory and automatic for all lot and parcel owners and their successors. The
association will have lien authority to ensure the collection of dues from all
members.
         b.   The responsibility for maintaining open space and any facilities
located thereon is borne by the subdivider until eighty percent (80%) of the
lots are sold and the initial letter of credit or bond for establishment of the
natural landscape is released. Ownership is then passed to a public agency, a
not-for-profit entity whose primary purpose is the preservation and maintenance
of open space, or to the homeowners/property owners association.
         c.   In the event the not-for-profit entity or the homeowners/property
owners association ceases to exist, the responsibility for maintaining the open
space and any facilities is borne by all lot and parcel owners and their
successors.
         d.   A cost estimate for natural landscape and ecological restoration
activities shall be submitted with the cost estimates for infrastructure and
stormwater improvements. The amount of the bond or letter(s) of credit
furnished by the subdivider shall be in the amount of one hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the estimated cost of the work and materials required for
these activities. This is a separate bond or letter of credit from that
furnished for roads but may be combined with the bond or letter of credit for
stormwater work.
         e.   Prior to release of the bond or letter of credit, the developer
or homeowners/property owners association shall submit a maintenance bond or
letter of credit for ten percent (10%) of the project cost to be valid for two
(2) years.
   C.   Clustering of Lots, Structures, and Building Sites.
      1.   Clustering of lots, structures and building sites is required when
possible and shall be determined by designing lots, structures, and sites
around open space areas, where preference is given to land, not necessarily
undisturbed, which either retains or has been substantially restored to its
original native character. The following describes the different levels of open
space quality, from highest to lowest, and siting approval is based upon the
proposed development’s ability to preserve significant portions of open space
at the highest quality levels possible.
         a.   Priority 1: Intact natural communities, known habitats of rare
and endangered species, natural and restored wetlands, prairies, savannas and
woodlands, environmental corridors, significant historic and archaeological
properties, and areas with steep slopes.
         b.   Priority 2: Natural landscaped areas created to provide plant and
wildlife habitat and open space amenities.
         c.   Priority 3: Areas providing little habitat but providing a
viewshed, recreation or a sense of open space.
      2.   Lot and building site size may be reduced below that required by the
underlying zoning classification in order to achieve greater preservation and
protection of natural resources. The bulk regulations of
Table 16.76-2: Conservation Design Residential Yard and Bulk Requirements apply
to conservation design. However, the maximum permitted density in any
conservation design shall be limited to ninety percent (90%) of the density
permitted by the underlying zoning district after subtracting one-half (1/2) of
the site acreage located in wetlands, if any.

1   Lots located on cul-de-sac shall have a lot frontage of not less than 50%
of the district standard or fifty (50) feet, whichever is greater.
 
      3.   Lots shall be located as to minimize negative impacts on the
natural, visual, and cultural resources of the site and between incompatible
uses and activities.
      4.   Lots shall be designed and sited to:
         a.   Avoid disturbance of ADID high quality habitat wetlands and
remnant prairies unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         b.   Avoid disturbance of steep slopes (slopes of twelve percent (12%)
or more) unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         c.   Avoid disturbance of woodlands and savannas unless there are no
practicable alternatives. In all cases, the subdivider shall preserve at least
seventy percent (70%) of the area of woodland and savanna of one (1) acre or
larger.
         d.   Avoid disturbance of wetlands and wetland buffers unless there
are no practicable alternatives. In all cases, the subdivider shall preserve at
least eighty percent (80%) of wetlands and wetland buffers.
         e.   Avoid disturbance of floodplains unless there are no practicable
alternatives. In all cases, the subdivider shall preserve at least ninety
percent (90%) of floodplains by area.
         f.   Minimize fragmentation of natural areas and open space while also
providing for access and views from clusters.
         g.   Minimize disturbance of natural depressions, drainage ways, and
sensitive recharge areas to facilitate their use for runoff infiltration and
filtering.
         h.   Maintain scenic views of open space from adjacent and proposed
roads. Minimize visual impact through the use of landscape.
         i.   Protect high priority aquifer recharge areas as identified in the
SARA Map.
         j.   Preserve buildings and sites of historic significance or
incorporate them through adaptive reuse.
   D.   Trail Network. Installation of a multi-purpose trail system is
encouraged to provide access to open space areas within the subdivision, as
well as access to adjacent subdivisions and regional trails. The trail system
shall be owned and maintained by the same entity as the open space. A trail
ownership and maintenance plan shall be approved by the County prior to the
approval of the final plat. The County may require trails to be designed and
constructed to meet applicable American with Disability Act (ADA) requirements,
if any.
   E.   Landscape Standards. The use of native plant species is required within
the perimeter buffer, bio-swales, detention basins, common open space, buffers
of streams, lakes, wetlands, and other water bodies, areas. Native plant
species consists of grasses, wildflowers, shrubs, and trees that are native to
the greater Chicago region as identified in “Plants of the Chicago Region”
(Swink and Wilhelm, 1994). The installation of landscape and long-term
management shall conform to the approved stewardship plan's maintenance,
monitoring, and performance criteria.
   F.   Parking Standards. In addition to the other parking standards of this
Ordinance, parking lots in conservation design subdivision shall comply with
the following:
      1.   Parking lots shall be designed to maximize the opportunity to
infiltrate and filter runoff from the lot. The use of pervious surface is
encouraged in lieu of conventional asphalt or concrete paving. However,
consideration and mitigation of potential groundwater contamination resulting
from the infiltration of stormwater runoff into the subsurface shall be
included in the design.
      2.   Parking lot runoff shall be routed to swales and bio-swales. Where
curbing is determined to be necessary, frequent curb cuts are required to allow
runoff to enter swale and bio-swale structures.
   G.   Stewardship Plan.
      1.   Overview.
         a.   A stewardship plan shall be prepared by a specialist in the area
of ecological restoration or natural landscape. The plan shall be comprised of
two parts: 1) a short-term plan for the establishment, enhancement, and
restoration of natural areas; and 2) a long-term plan for the maintenance and
monitoring of natural areas in perpetuity.
         b.   The plan shall be approved as part of the subdivision review
process and recorded in the covenants for the subdivision. The plan shall be in
text form with appropriate maps and/or graphic renderings that identify the
various management units on the site. The plan shall provide specific details
and methods regarding the preservation, re-establishment, maintenance, and
management of open areas and natural resources in perpetuity on the subject
site. It shall be in a format that is easily understood and identify all
specific tasks that shall be completed in order to ensure the viability of
current and future resources on the site.
         c.   The plan shall address and/or allocate:
            (1)   The short-term enhancement and restoration of remnant natural
areas and the establishment of new landscapes.
            (2)   The long-term maintenance and monitoring of such areas.
            (3)   The responsibility and guidelines for performing said tasks
and any necessary provisions for replacement costs and long-term capital
improvements.
         d.   In addition, the plan shall:
            (1)   Serve as an educational resource for future residents and
property owners.
            (2)   Designate and map the ownership of natural features and
dedicated open space.
            (3)   Allocate responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance
and operation of the dedicated open space and any facilities located thereon,
including provisions for ongoing maintenance and long-term capital
improvements.
            (4)   Estimate the cost for maintenance, inspection and operation
of the dedicated open space areas for said work. The plan shall describe the
means by which such funding will be obtained.
            (5)   Provide that the plan cannot be changed without the approval
of the County and describe how the plan will be enforced.
         e.   The stewardship plan shall include performance standards for all
natural open space areas and naturalized stormwater management facilities and
buffers. The performance standards shall identify proposed methods for
establishing the areas and require monitoring and maintenance for at least
three (3) full growing seasons following initial enhancement, restoration, and
planting, or until initial performance standards have been met. The design
intent for such areas is to provide an aesthetic, healthy, and diverse
community of native vegetation to meet the objectives of soil stabilization,
water quality improvement, and wildlife habitat. Minimum performance standards
for restoration, planting, maintenance, and monitoring of natural open space
and naturalized stormwater facilities are detailed below. Under circumstances
where the minimum performance standards are not met, alternative performance
standards shall be presented to and approved through the development review
process.
         f.   Beyond the initial establishment and restoration period, regular
maintenance and management shall be performed in perpetuity to continue to meet
the performance criteria and to enhance natural ecologic conditions over time.
      2.   Short-Term Landscape Restoration and Planting Schedule of
Stewardship Plan. A site specific restoration and planting schedule shall be
submitted to the County with required final engineering plans. The plan shall
be prepared by a qualified professional in the field of ecological restoration
and/or natural landscape. A cost estimate to be used to calculate the amount of
the required bond and/or letter of credit shall also be prepared. At a minimum
the plan shall include:
         a.   A map drawn to scale depicting all proposed restoration and
planting areas. Identification of proposed management units based on remnant
natural areas, soil types, topography, hydrology, and pre-settlement
vegetation. Management unit mapping shall also show the overall layout of the
development to demonstrate that naturalized areas are adequately set back from
structures and other infrastructure so that the potential for fire hazards
during controlled or accidental burns is reduced. Where applicable, fire
breaks, including those in the form of mowed paths, should also be identified.
Aggressive native tree species to be removed shall be noted.
         b.   A list of all plants, seeds, and/or plugs to be used within each
management unit. All plantings shall consist of species native to the greater
Chicago region, as identified in “Plants of the Chicago Region” (Swink and
Wilhelm, 1994), of a local genotype and appropriate for the proposed habitat.
The number of plants and plugs to be used and the amount/weight of seed per
species shall also be included, along with seeding rates per acre for each
species.
         c.   For existing wetland, prairie, savanna, and woodland communities,
a schedule of management and enhancement activities for areas proposed for
restoration. This schedule shall address methods of weed and brush removal,
including herbicide, cutting and hand pulling, replanting necessary to restore
native plant diversity, and, where appropriate, sediment removal, re-grading,
stabilization, and related measures necessary to restore degraded wetlands and
aquatic systems.
         d.   A three-year (3-year) management schedule that includes proposed
timing and description of the following: site preparation, application of
herbicides, seeding activity, mowing, controlled burns, and similar activities.
Areas being restored to native communities should be protected by silt fencing
or construction fencing to prevent unnecessary disruption or destruction due to
nearby construction activity.
      3.   Short-Term Landscape Restoration and Planting Schedule Preferred
Criteria. The success of natural landscape can be affected by the
appropriateness of the plant species selected, the effectiveness of the grading
and seedbed preparation, the quality of the seed and plant material used, the
timing of the planting, and attention to early maintenance. Whenever possible,
land shall remain undisturbed until seeding can be accomplished. The success of
the project will be formally evaluated by the following vegetation performance
standards monitored over time.
         a.   In order to ensure adequate diversity of plants, respond to
varying environmental and hydrologic conditions, ensure the establishment of
native landscapes that are functional, aesthetic, and cost-effective, and
provide reasonable variety to meet aesthetic expectations, the following is
required:
            (1)   A minimum of ten (10) species of native plants shall be
established within any naturalized stormwater facility, such as naturalized
detention basins or swales.
            (2)   A minimum of forty (40) species of native plants shall be
established in any upland landscapes.
         b.   By the end of the first full growing season, planted areas shall
have ninety percent (90%) vegetation cover and no area larger than one (1)
square meter may be devoid of vegetation. A cover crop of annual rye or oats
may be used to help achieve this goal. At least seventy-five percent (75%) of
the plugs, root stock, and tubers, and fifty percent (50%) of the seeded
species should be present and alive. If an area is designed as an aquatic or
emergent system, it is anticipated that portions of the submerged area will be
periodically exposed and without vegetation cover due to fluctuating water
levels. If, by the end of the first full growing season, the basin emergent
zones and/or side slopes fail to support the establishment of sufficient
vegetation, then corrective measures regarding the fundamental design of the
area and/or planting plan are required.
         c.   During the second growing season at least sixty percent (60%) of
the permanent species planted in seed form should be evident. Ninety percent
(90%) or more of species planted as plugs, root stock and tubers shall also
have persisted into the second season. If this fails to occur, a determination
shall be made as to why and remedial action is necessary. Remediation may
include over-seeding and/or plugging of appropriate species. Finally,
undesirable, invasive plant species shall not be prevalent in any of the
management units. No invasive, weedy species shall be among the five (5) most
dominant plant species in the overall vegetative cover, including any of the
following: Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), Common reed (Phragmites
australis), Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Non-native thistle (Cirsium
spp., Carduus spp.), Sweet clover (Melilotus spp.), Crown vetch (Coronilla
varia), Wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), Burdock (Arctium spp.), Garlic
shallard (Alliaria petiolata), Teasel (Dipsacus spp.), Ragweed (Ambrosia spp.),
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.), Sandbar willow
(Salix interior), Honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), Multiflora rose (Rosa
multiflora), Box elder (Acer negundo), Canadian Goldenrod (Solidago
Canadensis), Queen Anne’s Lace (Daucus carota).
            A more complete listing of common invasive species is found in the
“Illinois Nature Preserve Management Guidelines.”
         d.   At the end of the third full growing season, at least seventy-
five percent (75%) of the seeded permanent species and ninety percent (90%) or
more of species planted as plugs, root stock, and tubers are expected to be
established. Alternatively, native perennial species that volunteer on the
site, excluding undesirable invasive species, may be counted in determining the
preceding criteria. Qualitative vegetative sampling within each management area
shall achieve the following in order to be determined a success: a mean
“coefficient of conservatism” shall meet or exceed three (3) and the “floristic
quality index” shall meet or exceed twenty (20), except in designated
stormwater management facilities as per “Plants of the Chicago Region” (F.
Swink ad G. Wilhelm).
         e.   The five (5) most dominant species of the overall vegetative
cover within each management unit shall not include any of the undesirable
species referenced above under the second season performance standards. If the
identified level of species development fails to occur, a determination shall
be made as to why, and a remedial action plan shall be prepared and submitted
to the County for approval. The approved remedial plan shall be implemented and
continued monitoring is required beyond the third growing season until these
performance criteria are met. Where the minimum performance standards cannot be
achieved, a written explanation and alternative performance standards shall be
submitted for consideration by the County.
         f.   The landscape installation bond or letter of credit will not be
reduced or released until these conditions have been achieved and a maintenance
letter of credit has been provided.
      4.   Short-Term Plant Monitoring Requirements. The following tasks shall
be performed within each management unit identified in the landscape/planting
plan during the first three (3) years. Monitoring and reporting is required
annually for a minimum of three (3) full growing seasons during and following
restoration and planting. Under circumstances where the minimum performance
standards cannot be achieved, alternative performance standards shall be
presented to the County for review and approval.
         a.   Plant inventory of all naturally landscaped areas. This inventory
shall determine overall vegetative cover, the total number of species, and the
prevalence of undesirable/invasive species, consistent with specified
performance criteria. This inventory is used to determine where follow-up
seeding or planting is needed, and to identify, locate, and remove undesirable
weedy species on a timely basis. Permanent transect vegetation sampling
techniques should be used within each management unit to adequately document
and monitor plant community establishment over the initial three-year (3-year)
period. The presence of any plant species observed outside of a transect and
not documented by sampling along such transect shall also be noted. Sampling
techniques and summaries shall be compiled consistent with methods described in
“Plants of the Chicago Region” (F. Swink ad G. Wilhelm).
         b.   Establishment of permanent photographic monitoring locations.
Photographs shall be taken to document the establishment of vegetative cover,
erosion problems, and other relevant maintenance concerns within each
management unit identified in the landscape/planting plan. Photographs shall be
of satisfactory quality and resolution to accomplish the intent of the
performance standards and shall be taken from the same locations during each
monitoring event. A detailed description of the camera/photo location based on
distance from a permanent structure, the orientation of the photo, and the
vegetation zone being photographed shall be provided. Additional photos should
be taken of problem areas and remedial activities.
      5.   Long-Term Landscape Monitoring and Management. 
         a.   Long-term monitoring shall be performed on an annual basis until
the maintenance bond is released. Monitoring reports shall be submitted to the
County for review and approval.
         b.   Continued ecological management shall be provided to maintain a
diverse native plant community, consistent with performance criteria, to
minimize the proliferation of weeds and undesired woody vegetation, and to
prevent erosion. At a minimum, the site shall continue to meet the vegetation
performance standards of the third growing season, as specified above, with
regard to erosion control, vegetation coverage, species diversity, and control
of invasive species. Long-term maintenance consists of controlled burning,
generally every one (1) to three (3) years or as dictated by site conditions.
To maintain the established native plant communities, spot control and
application of herbicides shall be performed, as necessary.
         c.   Long-term maintenance includes the removal of trash or debris and
the removal of obstructions from detention basin outlet structures. Periodic
removal of accumulated sediment from swales, forebays, and settling basins
shall be done to maintain the function and aesthetics of stormwater facilities.
At a minimum, sediment shall be removed from forebays and sediment basins when
one (1) foot or more of sediment has accumulated.
         d.   The landscape maintenance letter of credit will only be released
after these standards have been achieved for two (2) years.
      6.   Reporting Requirements. Monitoring reports are due on February 1 for
each required reporting year and shall be submitted in a digital format to the
County and include the following:
         a.   A summary of vegetation data collected within each management
unit, including an assessment of compliance with performance criteria.
         b.   A description of vegetation maintenance activities, including
over-seeding, replanting, control of undesirable weedy species, and an
assessment of their effectiveness in meeting performance criteria.
         c.   Photographs and accompanying descriptions taken at permanent
monitoring stations.
         d.   A summary of maintenance activities, including the landscape
maintenance budgets, for both the current year and the coming year.
   H.   Tree Protection. To the greatest extent possible, significant trees and
tree stands that meet the tree inventory and protection standards should be
incorporated into protected open space. They should be identified and protected
within the stewardship plan.
      1.   Submittals and Standards for Tree Protection.
         a.   As part of the preliminary plat submittal, the subdivider shall
submit a tree survey, as defined below, and a tree preservation proposal
prepared by a qualified arborist, forester, or similarly qualified
professional.
            (1)   The survey shall consist of a scaled drawing that shows the
location of all desirable native tree species listed in this section having a
diameter at breast height (DBH) of four (4) or more inches. The inventory shall
also include all other existing trees with a DBH of eight (8) or more inches,
excluding prohibited tree species listed in this section. In the case of a
multi-stemmed tree, the diameter of the clump is taken as a whole. The survey
shall include, at a minimum, an inventory listing individual trees by tag
number, the tree species by common name and scientific name, size (DBH),
condition, and any observed problems.
            (2)   The survey shall also include a tree count of desirable
native tree species listed in this section having a diameter at breast height
(DBH) of between two (2) and four (4) inches. The relative locations of
groupings of these trees shall be identified on a site map.
            (3)   Where trees are located in a permanently protected open space
area and will be free from any grading activity, identification of individual
trees is not required.
         b.   Where mass removal or clear cutting of desirable native trees has
occurred, the Staff Plat Review Committee will not accept nor review a proposed
subdivision for a period of one (1) year.
         c.   Where individual trees or stands of trees are removed by any
cause or for any reason other than those listed on the tree replacement
exception, the County may require that the area containing the removed trees or
stands of trees be replanted and that the area be dedicated as and made subject
to a tree preservation easement, maintained in perpetuity as open space.
         d.   During development and construction activity, all reasonable
steps shall be taken to prevent damage to or destruction of protected trees,
woodlands, and savannas within protected open space areas. These steps include:
            (1)   Soils shall not be removed, compacted, or otherwise disturbed
within the critical root zone.
            (2)   A protective fence approved by the County shall be erected
around the critical root zone of any protected tree or woodland area. Signs
shall be affixed to said fence indicating the presence of the critical root
zone and a protected area.
            (3)   All desirable trees on property adjacent to the subject site
and within ten (10) feet of the site’s property line or have a critical root
zone extending into the subject site, shall be protected from unreasonable
damage by the use of acceptable tree protection measures.
            (4)   Mass cuts and mass grading are prohibited in woodland areas.
            (5)   Boring shall be used to install any underground utilities in
tree areas, where feasible.
            (6)   The subdivider shall ensure that all applicable
subcontractors are trained in proper tree protection.
            (7)   No excess soil, additional fill, equipment, trailers,
liquids, or construction debris is allowed to be placed within the identified
critical root zone of any tree.
            (8)   Only protective non-damaging devices or attachments may be
attached to any tree during construction.
      2.   Tree Replacement.
         a.   Any protected tree removed pursuant to County approval shall be
replaced on an inch-diameter basis as provided for below:
TABLE 16.76-3: TREE REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE
Diameter at Breast Height of Removed Number of replacement trees required
Tree                                 as measured in diameter at breast height

26 or more inches                    n/a             15            12
 
         b.   Tree replacement shall be exercised to the greatest extent
possible. When a high density of trees is not appropriate or the full
replacement of trees on site would result in the unreasonable crowding of
trees, appropriate reductions in the tree replacement amount are allowed. If
available, a fee in lieu of payment for tree replacement and ecological
restoration may be approved by the County.
         c.   A tree replacement plan shall be prepared by a qualified
arborist, forester, or similarly qualified professional in the field of natural
resources, and familiar with the native ecosystems of the Chicago region. The
tree replacement plan shall depict the location and corresponding elevation of
each replacement tree and each preserved tree. Corresponding text shall state
the species and diameter of each tree with a description of the proposed
management strategy to ensure its health and survival on the property.
         d.   Replacement trees with local genotypes from a two-hundred-fifty
mile (250-mile) radius shall be used. All trees shall be high quality,
installed free of disease, and in a manner that ensures the availability of
sufficient soil and water to sustain healthy growth. Unless otherwise approved
by the County, replacement trees shall be selected from the following native
species. No species of evergreens are permitted as suitable options to meet
tree replacement requirements.

         e.   Consistent with good forestry and ecological practices,
replacement trees shall be of either equivalent or a superior quality of
species. For example, a softwood tree may be replaced with a hardwood tree, but
a hardwood tree cannot be replaced by a softwood tree. In order to preserve and
enhance the oak-hickory savannas and woods native to McHenry County, oak and
hickory trees shall be replaced in kind with native oak and hickory species.
         f.   Invasive trees and shrubs shall be removed as part of the
forestry practices and ecological restoration activities, and are not treated
or acknowledged as protected tree species. Aggressive native trees shall be
removed as necessary and appropriate for the ecologic restoration of oak-
hickory savannas and woods. Proposals to remove such trees shall be identified
in the stewardship plan. The following trees do not require replacement nor
shall they be planted as replacements for desirable trees:

      3.   Tree Replacement Exceptions. Trees removed by or for any of the
following reasons need not be replace provided that the property owner is able
to provide documentation that the tree removal met one of the following
exceptions:
         a.   Emergencies involving, but not limited to tornados, windstorms,
floods, freezes, or other natural disasters.
         b.   Trees that have become, or immediately threaten to become, a
hazard to persons, property or other vegetation and require immediate removal
or destruction.
         c.   Diseased, dead, or dying trees as confirmed by an arborist,
forester, or a qualified professional in the field of natural resources.
         d.   All active orchards and state or federal government approved tree
farms are exempt from these terms and provisions, but only in relation to those
trees which are planted and growing for the sale or intended sale in the
ordinary course of business or for a public purpose.
         e.   Invasive species such as common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica),
glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula), and honeysuckle (Lonicera sp.), which are
commonly removed as part of good forestry practices and ecological restoration,
are not protected tree species.
         f.   Trees removed for public roadway and infrastructure improvements
and maintenance need not be replaced.
         Tree replacement will be required if trees are removed for any other
reason or if the property owner is unable to provide sufficient documentation
regarding the cause or purpose of the tree remove.
      4.   Release of Improvement Guarantees. Final approval and release of
improvement guarantees will not occur until a final inspection by the County
confirms that the conditions of this section have been met. In the event that
conditions cannot be met, an alternative proposal shall be prepared. If
available, a fee in lieu of payment to be determined by the County may be used
to meet the objectives of this section.
   I.   Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Standards.
      1.   Treatment and disposal options that are consistent with state and
federal anti-degradation policies shall be utilized. In particular, options
that best protect groundwater, wetlands, surface waters, and other natural
resources from increased concentrations of nutrients and related pollutants
that may impact aquatic life, native plant diversity, and related uses shall be
utilized. The McHenry County Department of Health reserves the right to require
review by an outside agency or qualified onsite wastewater treatment
specialist, including, but not limited to, USDA/NRCS, Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Illinois State Water Survey, and Illinois State Geological
Survey.
      2.   A wastewater treatment option shall be selected and implemented
based on its ability to ensure groundwater recharge, beneficial reuse of
nutrients, protection of groundwater quality, protection of surface water
quality, and protection of environmentally sensitive environments. Shallow
groundwater flow direction, projected wastewater flows, projected strength of
the wastewater, sensitivity of the receiving environment, recharge capability,
potential cumulative impact of the chemical, organic, nutrient and bacterial
loading on groundwater, and lifetime cost of the system shall be taken into
consideration when selecting the wastewater treatment option.
      3.   The wastewater treatment system shall comply with the McHenry County
Public Health Ordinance. Sites utilizing Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency permitted technology shall conform to all of the requirements of the
IEPA and receive all applicable permits prior to the Planning and Development
Committee recommending approval of the final plat.
   J.   Violations And Corrective Action.
      1.   If at any time the Zoning Enforcement Officer determines that the
open space management entity is in violation of the terms of this Ordinance,
the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall give written notice of such violation and
demand corrective action sufficient to cure the violation, and where necessary,
restore the portion of the property so injured. If the open space management
entity fails to cure the violation within thirty (30) days after receipt of
notice thereof from the Zoning Enforcement Officer, or, under circumstances
where the violation cannot reasonably be cured within a thirty (30) day period,
fails to commence or fails to continue to cure such violation until finally
cured, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may bring an action in accordance with
the enforcement provisions of this Ordinance.
      2.   If the Zoning Enforcement Officer determines that circumstances
require immediate action to prevent or mitigate significant damage to the open
space or natural areas the County may pursue its remedies without prior notice
to the open space management entity. Under such circumstances, the County may
enter dedicated open space areas in order to take corrective action necessary
to ensure compliance and the provisions of long-term management and
stewardship.

§ 16.80.020 GENERAL STANDARDS OF APPLICABILITY.
   A.   Authority to Continue.
      1.   Any use, structure, lot, or sign that existed as a lawful
nonconformity at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, and any structure,
lot, or use that has been made nonconforming because of the terms of this
Ordinance or any subsequent amendments, including map amendments, may continue
subject to the provisions of this chapter so long as it remains otherwise
lawful.
      2.   If property is used in a manner that was classified as a permitted
use prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and that use is now
classified as a conditional use as of the effective date of this Ordinance,
that use is deemed a nonconforming use. Such uses are allowed to continue and
are controlled by the provisions of this chapter. However, any addition,
enlargement, or expansion of the use is required to obtain a conditional use
permit at the time of the addition, enlargement, or expansion.
      3.   A use, structure, lot, or sign that is unlawful at the time of the
adoption of this Ordinance remains unlawful if it does not conform with each
and every requirement of this Ordinance. A use, structure, or sign is unlawful
when present on an unlawful lot. An unlawful use, structure, or sign is a
violation of this Ordinance and subject to
Chapter 16.84 (Enforcement).
   B.   Burden on Property Owner to Establish Status. In all cases, the burden
of establishing the status of a nonconformity are upon the property owner of
the structure, use, or lot.
   C.   Safety Regulations. All regulations enacted to promote public health,
safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all building, fire, and
health codes, apply to nonconformities.
(Ord. O-201410-10-035, passed 10-14-2014; Ord. O-201601-ZBA-006, passed 1-19-
2016; Ord. O-201603-ZBA-010, passed 3-17-2016, § 20.2; Ord. O-201803-ZBA-10-08,
passed 3-19-2018; Ord. O-201808-10-033, passed 8-21-2018)
§ 16.80.030 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A.   Definition of Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use is the use of land
or use of a structure that, as of the effective date of this Ordinance or any
subsequent amendments, includingmap amendments, is used for purposes that are
not allowed in the zoning district in which it is located, provided that the
property owner can document that the use was in conformance with the zoning
ordinance in effect as of the date that the use was established or that the
property owner can provide documentation to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer that the agricultural, single- or two-family residential,
or residential accessory use existed prior to, March 1, 2005, regardless of if
such agricultural, single- or two-family residential, or residential accessory
use was lawful at the time of establishment.
   B.   Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance. Maintenance and repair may be
performed on any structure that is used in whole or in part for a nonconforming
use, provided it will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of
nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the structure in any manner.
   C.   Expansions and Relocations.
      1.   A nonconforming use of land or a structure cannot be expanded,
extended, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity
includes, without limitation:
         a.   Expansion of any structure devoted entirely to a nonconforming
use.
         b.   An expansion, extension, or relocation of a nonconforming use or
its accessory uses to any land area or structure not currently occupied by such
nonconforming use, except where a residential dwelling is a nonconforming use
in a zoning district, additions and the construction of a private garage as an
accessory use is permitted.
         c.   An expansion, extension, or relocation of a nonconforming use
within a structure, including its accessory uses, to any portion of the floor
area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use.
      2.   A nonconforming use of land or a structure cannot be relocated, in
whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel. The
nonconforming use may only be relocated to another lot or parcel if the use
then conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
relocated, including all use regulations.
   D.   Structural Alterations, Damage, or Destruction. For the purposes of
this Section, structural alterations conducted without proper approval are
treated as damage or destruction.
      1.   No structural alterations are permitted on any structure used in
whole or in part for a nonconforming use, except in the following situations:
         a.   When the structural alteration is required by law or is necessary
to restore the structure to a safe condition, upon the order of any official
charged with protecting the public safety.
         b.   When the structural alteration is for the purpose of eliminating
the nonconformity.
         c.   When the structural alteration will not create any new
nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing nonconformity, or increase
the bulk of the structure in any manner, and the cost of the structural
alteration is less than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value at that
time (per the methodology of this Section).
      2.   In the event that any structure that is used, in whole or in part,
to a nonconforming use, is damaged or destroyed to the extent of fifty percent
(50%) or more of its replacement value at that time, then the nonconforming use
cannot be continued unless the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
      3.   In the event that any structure that is devoted, in whole or in
part, to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed to the extent of less than
fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value at that time, the structure may be
repaired, reconstructed or restored and the nonconforming use continued,
provided that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree
of nonconformity is not increased. A building permit must be obtained for such
rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction within one (1) year of the
date of damage or destruction.
      4.   The replacement value of the structure, which is devoted, in whole
or in part, to a nonconforming use, is based on: 1) the sale of that structure,
excluding the value of the land, within the previous year or, if that is not
applicable; 2) an appraisal within the last two (2) years or, if that is not
available; 3) the amount for which the structure was insured prior to the date
of damage or destruction or, if that is not available; 4) an alternative method
determined acceptable by the County.
      5.   The amount of damage to a structure is equal to the repair cost of
bringing that structure to its original conditions prior to the damage or
destruction. Calculation of the repair cost must include all materials and
market rate labor to reconstruct to the same quality or value. If the structure
is located in the floodway or floodplain, it must also consider value of all
home improvements over the last ten (10) years. Repair costs will be reviewed
utilizing published construction estimating guide(s).
   E.   Change of Use. A nonconforming use cannot be changed to any use other
than those allowed within the zoning district in which it is located. When such
a nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part, to an allowed use,
the whole or part that has been made to conform cannot be changed back to a use
that is prohibited. A change of use occurs when an existing nonconforming use
has been terminated and another use has commenced. Any change in use in
violation of this Ordinance is deemed an immediate abandonment of the
previously existing nonconforming use and cannot be changed back to the
previous nonconforming use.
   F.   Discontinuation or Abandonment. If a nonconforming use is discontinued
or the structure that it occupies becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a
continuous period of one (1) year, such use is deemed abandoned and cannot be
reestablished or resumed regardless of the intent to resume or to continue the
use. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure must comply with
all regulations of the zoning district in which such land or structure is
located. The following exceptions apply:
      1.   If the period of such discontinuance is caused by government action
or acts of God, it is not included in calculating the length of discontinuance.
      2.   If the property owner files notice in writing of the suspension of a
nonconforming use with the Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to the expiration
of the one-year (1-year) timeframe of allowed discontinuance, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer may approve an extension of such timeframe for one (1)
additional year. Notice must show good cause for allowing a suspension of a
nonconforming use to exceed the one (1) year permitted by this section. Failure
to file such notice is deemed as intent to abandon the nonconforming use. Once
all suspension periods have expired, the nonconforming use is deemed abandoned
and cannot be resumed.
   G.   Accessory Uses. No use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming
use shall continue after such principal use has ceased or terminated.

§ 16.80.040 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A.   Definition of Nonconforming Structure. If an existing structure
conformed to the district bulk and setback requirements of this Ordinance prior
to the effective date of this Ordinance or if the propertyowner can document to
the satisfaction of the Zoning Enforcement Officer that the agricultural,
single- or two family-residential, or residential accessory structure existed
prior to March 1, 2005, regardless of if such agricultural, single- or two-
family residential, or residential accessory structure conformed to district
bulk and setback requirements of this Ordinance at the time of construction,
and such structure does not meet all standards set forth in this Ordinance,
that structure is deemed a legal nonconforming structure.
   B.   Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance. Maintenance and repair may be
performed on any nonconforming structure. No repairs or reconstruction are
permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of any
previously existing nonconformity.
   C.   Expansions and Relocations.
      1.   A structure that is nonconforming with respect to the bulk
requirements and setbacks for the zoning district in which it is located cannot
be added to or enlarged unless specifically permitted by this Ordinance.
      2.   No nonconforming structure may be relocated, in whole or in part, to
any other location on the same or any other property, unless the entire
structure thereafter conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in
which the structure is relocated. This provision shall not be interpreted as
prohibiting the elevation of a nonconforming structure for the purpose of flood
proofing or flood repair.
   D.   Structural Alterations, Damage, or Destruction. For the purposes of
this Section, structural alterations conducted without proper approval are
treated as damage or destruction.
      1.   No structural alterations are permitted for any nonconforming
structure, except in the following situations:
         a.   When the structural alteration is required by law or is necessary
to restore the structure to a safe condition, upon the order of any official
charged with protecting the public safety.
         b.   When the structural alteration will result in eliminating the
nonconformity.
         c.   When the structural alteration is located entirely in a portion
of the structure that complies with bulk requirements and setbacks, will not
create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing
nonconformity.
         d.   When the structure is nonconforming with respect only to minimum
lot area and/or minimum lot frontage and will not create any new nonconformity.
         e.   When specifically permitted by this Ordinance.

      2.   In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or
destroyed to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value
at that time, then the structure cannot be restored or rebuilt unless the
structure is made to conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which
it is located.
      3.   When such a structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of less
than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value at that time, it may be
repaired and reconstructed provided that no new nonconformities are created and
that the existing degree of nonconformity is not increased. A building permit
must be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction
within one (1) year of the date of damage or destruction.
      4.   The replacement value of the nonconforming structure is based on: 1)
the sale of that structure, excluding the value of the land, within the
previous year or, if that is not applicable; 2) an appraisal within the last
two (2) years or, if that is not available; 3) the amount for which the
structure was insured prior to the date of damage or destruction or, if that is
not available; 4) an alternative method determined acceptable by the County.
      5.   The amount of damage to a structure is equal to the repair cost of
bringing that structure to its original conditions prior to the damage or
destruction. Calculation of the repair cost must include all materials and
market rate labor to reconstruct to the same quality or value. If the structure
is located in the floodway or floodplain, it must also consider value of all
home improvements over the last ten (10) years. Repair costs will be reviewed
utilizing published construction estimating guide(s).
   E.   Extension of Walls for Nonconforming Single-Family and Two-Family
Dwellings. Where a single-family or two-family dwelling is a legal
nonconforming structure because of encroachment into the required street
setback, the structure may be enlarged or extended vertically along the same
plane as defined by its existing perimeter walls, so long as the resulting
structure complies with the required side yard setbacks and does not increase
the degree of the existing nonconformity or otherwise violate this Ordinance.

§ 16.80.050 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   A.   Definition. A nonconforming lot or parcel is a tract of land designated
on a duly recorded subdivision plat, or by a duly recorded deed, or by other
lawful means that comply with the lot area, lot width, lot frontage and other
dimensional standards of the zoning district in which it was located at the
time of its creation, but that does not comply with the minimum lot area, lot
frontage or other dimensional requirement of the zoning district in which it is
now located.
   B.   Individual Lots or Parcels of Record.
      1.   An existing nonconforming lot or parcel of record may be used for a
use allowed within the zoning district in which it is located, provided that
the structure meets all district bulk and setback requirements. Non-conforming
lots and portions of multiple non-conforming lots may be combined into a new
non-conforming lot as long as the resulting lot is more conforming with respect
to lot area, lot width, lot frontage, and other dimensional standards of the
zoning district in which it is located.
   C.   Lots or Parcels Deemed Conforming. Lots or parcels created as a result
of the following actions are deemed conforming for the purposes of this
Ordinance:
      1.   When land area is acquired by a government agency for expansion of
right-of-way.
      2.   When the action of waterways that forms the boundaries of a lot
reduce the lot area.
      3.   When property lines are established by a court order in order to
settle a boundary dispute between adjacent property owners.
   D.   Reduced Setbacks. Setbacks for single-family dwellings and residential
accessory structures that are on lots or parcels deemed nonconforming due to
insufficient width may be reduced from the setbacks established by the bulk and
setback tables of this Ordinance in the following manner:
      1.   On interior lots or parcels less than one-hundred (100) feet width,
the setback from one interior side lot line may be reduced to ten (10) feet and
the setback from the other interior side lot line may be reduced to ten (10)
percent of the width of the lot. This reduction applies to both principal and
accessory structures, either of which may be used to establish which side
setback may be reduced to 10-percent (10%) of the width of the lot.
      2.   On interior lots or parcels over one-hundred (100) feet in width.
the setback from the interior side lot lines may be reduced to ten (10) feet.
      3.   On corner lots, the setback from the interior side lot line may be
reduced to ten (10) feet and the setback from the corner side lot line may be
reduced to twenty (20) feet.

§ 16.80.060 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A.   A nonconforming sign may remain in use, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, meets the requirements of this section, and has not been damaged,
destroyed, or structurally altered as described in subsection D. below. The
sign face of an existing nonconforming sign may be replaced.
   B.   No nonconforming sign may be relocated, in whole or in part, to any
other location on the same or any other property unless the entire sign
thereafter conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which the sign
is relocated.
   C.    No nonconforming sign may be structurally altered or enlarged in a way
that increases the nonconformity of the sign. This in no way precludes normal
maintenance and cleaning or changing of the sign face.
   D.    In the event that any nonconforming sign is damaged, destroyed, or
structurally altered to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its
replacement value at that time, then the sign cannot be restored or rebuilt
unless the sign is made to conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located.

APPENDIX C: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS.
OVERVIEW
Best Management Practices (BMP) explain various options that constitute
acceptable methods to minimize impacts of wind energy systems (WES). These
include, but are not limited to, maintenance codes, environmental protection
practices (soil erosion prevention, groundwater protection, habitat protection,
and wildlife protection), operational practices, and resource lists.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Site Development and Construction Best Management Practices
During site planning and development, careful attention to reducing risk of
adverse impacts to species of concern from wind energy projects, through
careful site selection and facility design, is recommended. The following BMPs
can assist a developer in the planning process to reduce potential impacts to
species of concern. Use of these BMPs will limit adverse impacts to most
species of concern and their habitats present at many project sites. Although,
compensatory mitigation may be appropriate at a project level to address
significant site-specific concerns and pre-construction study results.
Wildlife
   1.   Avoid locating WESs in areas identified as having a demonstrated high
risk to birds and bats that cannot be mitigated.
   2.   To reduce avian collisions, place low and medium voltage connecting
power lines associated with the wind energy development underground to the
extent possible, unless burial of the lines is prohibitively expensive (e.g.,
where shallow bedrock exists) or where greater adverse impacts to biological
resources would result.
      a.   Overhead lines may be acceptable if sited away from high bird
crossing locations, to the extent practicable, such as between roosting and
feeding areas and nesting habitats. To the extent practicable, the lines should
be marked in accordance with Avian Power Line Interaction Committee (APLIC)
collision guidelines.
      b.   Overhead lines may be used when the lines parallel tree lines,
employ bird flight diverters, or are otherwise screened so that collision risk
is reduced.
      c.   Above-ground low and medium voltage lines, transformers and
conductors should follow the 2006 or most recent APLIC “Suggested Practices for
Avian Protection on Power Lines.”
   3.   Use construction and management practices to minimize activities that
may attract prey and predators to the WES.
   4.   Locate WESs to avoid separating bird and bat species of concern from
their daily roosting, feeding, or nesting sites if it has been documented that
the WES’s presence poses a risk to species.
   5.   When practical, use tubular towers or best available technology to
reduce ability of birds to perch and to reduce risk of collision.
   6.   Follow federal and state regulations and guidelines for handling toxic
substances to minimize danger to water and wildlife resources from spills.
Habitat and Natural Resources
   1.   Use available data from state and federal agencies, and other sources
(which could include maps or databases) that show the location of sensitive
resources.
   2.   For Midsize or Large WES, a mitigation plan to minimize the likely
impact to the identified habitats and natural resources shall be filed with any
application.
Retrofitting
Retrofitting is defined as replacing portions of existing WESs or ancillary
facilities so that at least part of the original turbine, tower, electrical
infrastructure or foundation is being utilized. Retrofitting BMPs include:
   1.   Retrofitting of WESs should use installation techniques that minimize
new site disturbance, soil erosion, and removal of vegetation of habitat value.
   2.   Retrofits should employ shielded, separated, or insulated electrical
conductors that minimize electrocution risk to avian wildlife per APLIC (Avian
Power Line Interaction Committee, 2006).
   3.   Retrofit designs should prevent or discourage nests or bird perches
from being established in or on the WES.
   4.   When facility lighting is included, use lights with motion or heat
sensors and switches to keep lights off when not required. Minimize the use of
high intensity lighting, steady-burning, or bright lights such as sodium vapor,
quartz, halogen, or other bright spotlights.
Repowering Existing Multi-WES Projects
Repowering may include removal and replacement of WES and associated
infrastructure. BMPs include:
   1.   To the greatest extent practicable, existing roads and disturbed areas
should be re-used in repower layouts.
   2.   Existing ancillary facilities should be re-used in repowering projects
to the extent practicable.
   3.   Existing overhead lines may be acceptable if located away from bird
crossing locations, such as between roosting and feeding areas, or between
lakes, rivers and nesting areas. Overhead lines may be used when they parallel
tree lines, employ bird flight diverters, or are otherwise screened so that
collision risk is reduced.
   4.   Above-ground low and medium voltage lines, transformers and conductors
should follow the most recent APLIC “Avian Protection Guidelines” or the most
recent APLIC “Suggested Practices for Avian Protection on Power Lines.”
   5.   Use of facility lighting at WES and ancillary facilities should be kept
to a minimum.
      a.   Use lights with motion or heat sensors and switches to keep lights
off when not required.
      b.   Lights should be hooded downward and directed to minimize horizontal
and skyward illumination.
      c.   Minimize use of high intensity lighting, steady-burning, or bright
lights such as sodium vapor, quartz, halogen, or other bright spotlights.
Decommissioning
During decommissioning, contractors and facility operators should apply BMPs
for road grading and native plant re-establishment to ensure that erosion and
overland flows are managed to restore pre-construction landscape conditions.
The Responsible Party, in conjunction with the Property Owner and state and
federal wildlife agencies, should restore the natural hydrology and plant
community to the greatest extent practical. Site inventories should be
conducted by qualified experts to detect invasive plants, and comprehensive
approaches to controlling any detected plants should be implemented and
maintained as long as necessary.

TITLE 17: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
   Chapter
      
17.60   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
CHAPTER 17.60: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Notes to User
The McHenry County Stormwater Management Ordinance (this Ordinance) regulates
development and substantial improvements to buildings in the floodplain
throughout McHenry County, within incorporated and unincorporated areas alike.
As you read through this Ordinance, you will notice that certain terms are
underlined and the Ordinance uses numerous acronyms. Underlined terms are
defined in
Appendix 12 and acronyms are defined in
Appendix 13.
Not all development is regulated by this Ordinance, but development that is
regulated requires a stormwater management permit before construction is
allowed to commence. Some development is regulated because of its size, such
as: development that hydrologically disturbs 5,000 square feet or more;
development that hydrologically disturbs 50% or more of a parcel; and
development that results in an additional 20,000 square feet of impervious area
since the original effective date of this Ordinance. Other development is
regulated because of its location, regardless of its size. Examples include
development that is located partially or completely in a flood hazard area or
wetland.
The basic steps used to determine whether a particular project requires a
stormwater management permit are listed below. The Permitting Flow Charts in
Appendix 1 provide additional guidance. If you have any questions about this
Ordinance or its applicability to a specific project, please contact the
McHenry County Department of Planning and Development.
   1.   Determine whether your project meets the definition of development (see
Appendix 12). If it does, go on to Step 2.
   2.   Determine whether your project is regulated development (see Article
II, Section B). If it is, go on to Step 3.
   3.   Determine whether your project is exempted development (see Article II,
Section C). If it is not, go on to Step 4.
   4.   Determine whether your project qualifies for a General Permit, which
waives certain requirements of this Ordinance in order to streamline the permit
process for specific types of routine projects (see Article III). If it does,
follow the process described for that General Permit. If it does not, go on to
Step 5.
   5.   Determine how your project is classified (see Article IV, Section A)
and then go on to Step 6.
   6.   Determine which Application Requirements apply (see Article V). Then go
on to Step 7.
   7.   Determine which Performance Standards apply (see Article VI). Then go
on to Step 8.
   8.   Submit a complete stormwater management permit application to a
Certified Community or to the McHenry County Department of Planning and
Development, along with the required submittals.
   9.   Await the issuance of a stormwater management permit prior to
commencing your project.

ARTICLE I
§ 17.60.010 INTRODUCTION, AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   A.   Introduction.
      1.   The McHenry County Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan, adopted
by the McHenry County Board on June 16, 1997 states, "To provide a consistent
level of protection and to provide equity throughout the County, a program for
consistent Countywide regulation and enforcement should be developed with
standards established at the Countywide level and, where appropriate, modified
at the watershed level to meet watershed specific needs. A Countywide
regulatory program would involve development of a Countywide watershed
development ordinance that applies to both incorporated and unincorporated
areas. ... [T]he watershed development ordinance should be comprehensive and
specify standards for stormwater drainage and detention, floodplain management,
soil erosion and sedimentation control, and stream and wetland protection in a
single document."
      2.   McHenry County has determined that uniform and consistent
enforcement by municipalities that adopt the standards of the Stormwater
Management Ordinance will enhance the effectiveness of the program. The County
also understands that local conditions may sometimes require additional or more
restrictive standards to meet the purpose of this Ordinance. In those instances
where the requirements of this Ordinance are not stipulated in a municipal
ordinance or are more restrictive than municipal requirements, this Ordinance
shall prevail. In some cases, the requirements of this Ordinance are more
restrictive than Federal or State minimum standards. A municipality has the
right to enact more restrictive standards than the minimum standards of this
Ordinance.
   B.   Authority.
      1.   This Ordinance is enacted pursuant to the powers granted to McHenry
County by 55 ILCS 5/5-1041, 1042, 1049, 1062, 1063, 1104, 12003, 15001 & 40001
et seq., (County) and by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 11-12-12, 11-30-2, 11-30-8, 11-31-
2 and 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. including 18g.
      2.   This Ordinance establishes minimum standards and may be superseded
by more restrictive Federal, State, or other local regulations.
   C.   Purpose.
      1.   The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish reasonable rules and
regulations for floodplain and stormwater management in order to:
         a.   Protect and preserve the quality and environmental values of land
and water resources in McHenry County;
         b.   Encourage development in a manner that promotes the orderly,
sustainable and cost-effective utilization of land and water resources;
         c.   Minimize the impact of development on flood hazards, erosion, and
water quality;
         d.   Minimize the need for additional expenditure of public funds for
flood control projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities and
utilities, and flood related emergency operations;
         e.   Minimize additional disruption of governmental services and the
economy due to flooding and drainage problems;
         f.   Maintain eligibility for the NFIP by equaling or exceeding
Federal floodplain development regulations (the NFIP is codified as 44 CFR 59-
79, as amended) thereby making federally subsidized flood insurance available
to residents in participating communities;
         g.   Protect the hydrologic, hydraulic, water quality, aquatic
habitat, recreation and other beneficial functions of streams, ponds, lakes,
wetlands, and flood storage areas;
         h.   Protect the quantity and quality of groundwater resources;
         i.   Meet the requirements of The Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act,
Resources, 615 ILCS 5/1 et seq.;
         j.   Minimize harm due to periodic flooding including loss of life and
property and threats and inconveniences to public health, safety and welfare;
         k.   Protect buildings and improvements to buildings from flood
damage;
         l.   Facilitate the permitting of sound maintenance of channels and
existing stormwater management systems; and
         m.   Require the regular, planned maintenance of new stormwater
management systems.

approximated by adding 2 feet to the highest adjacent grade.
            (3)   All above ground openings for new and replacement sanitary
sewer lines within a flood hazard area shall be watertight below the FPE. When
the BFE has not yet been determined according to the Flood Hazard Areas
Performance Standards of this Ordinance, the BFE may be approximated by adding
2 feet to the highest adjacent grade.
            (4)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement shall be buried a minimum of 3 feet below the existing
stream bed.
            (5)   Overhead utilities and associated supporting towers shall be
non-obstructive to flood flows, shall not be placed below the ordinary high
water mark, and shall be designed not to catch debris within a flood hazard
area. If attached to an existing bridge, the utility shall be constructed above
the low chord elevation.
            (6)   In IWMC, any excavation shall be backfilled with soil
excavated from the trench in the same stratification in which it was removed.
            (7)   A contingency plan for frac-out shall be required for any
utility proposed to be installed by directional boring.
         c.   Storm sewer outfalls, drain tile outfalls, and outlet channels –
To be authorized by this General Permit Number 1, storm sewer outfalls, drain
tile outfalls, and outlet channels shall meet the following criteria.
            (1)   The outfall shall not project riverward or lakeward of the
existing adjacent natural bank slope or bulkhead.
            (2)    Construction of outfalls and outlet channels shall not
result in an increase in ground elevation within a flood hazard area.
            (3)   The velocity of the discharge shall not exceed the scour
velocity of the channel soil, unless channel erosion would be prevented by the
use of rip-rap or other design measures.
            (4)   Outlets from drainage ditches shall not be opened to a stream
until the ditch is vegetated or otherwise stabilized to minimize stream
sedimentation.
            (5)   Bank erosion shall be prevented by aprons, energy
dissipaters, or drop structures as necessary.
         d.   Maintenance of existing roads and bridges – To be authorized by
this General Permit Number 1, maintenance of existing roads and bridges shall
meet the following criteria.
            (1)    Rehabilitative maintenance, such as milling and overlaying,

this General Permit Number 1, sidewalks, trails, driveways, and patios shall be
built at or below existing grade within a flood hazard area.
         f.   Boardwalks – To be authorized by this General Permit Number 1,
boardwalks shall meet the following criteria.
            (1)   This General Permit Number 1 does not apply to boardwalks
within a designated floodway.
            (2)   The construction of the boardwalk shall not result in any
increase in existing ground elevations within a flood hazard area.
            (3)   The boardwalk shall be anchored to prevent lateral movement.
            (4)   The boardwalk shall be non-obstructive to flood flows and
designed not to catch debris.

*   Refer to the Performance Standards and Terms and Conditions of Specified Development
of the specific General Permit.
5   Requirements may be waived by the Enforcement Officer for portions of the
development site that do not drain offsite.
 
      1.   Basic Requirements. The following requirements apply to all
regulated development, except regulated development authorized by a General
Permit. Specific requirements may be waived by the Enforcement Officer for
portions of the development site that do not drain offsite.
         a.   Control measures shall meet the minimum standards and
specifications of the Illinois Urban Manual unless stated otherwise in this
Ordinance.
         b.   Soil disturbance shall be conducted in such a manner as to
minimize erosion. Areas of the development site that are not to be disturbed
shall be protected from construction traffic or other disturbance until final
stabilization is achieved.
         c.   Soil stabilization measures shall consider the time of year,
development site conditions and the use of temporary or permanent measures.
         d.   Stabilization by seeding shall include topsoil placement and
fertilization, as necessary.
         e.   Native seed mixtures shall include rapid-growing annual grasses
or small grains to provide temporary soil stabilization.
         f.   Offsite property shall be protected from erosion and
sedimentation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at concentrated
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel, as necessary
to prevent erosion.
         g.   Sediment control measures shall be installed prior to the
disturbance of tributary areas.
         h.   Stabilization of disturbed areas shall be initiated immediately
whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth disturbing activities
have permanently ceased on any portion of the development site, or temporarily
ceased on any portion of the development site and will not resume for a period
exceeding 14 calendar days. Stabilization of disturbed areas shall be initiated
within 1 working day of permanent or temporary cessation of earth disturbing
activities and shall be completed as soon as possible, but not later than 14
calendar days from the initiation of stabilization work in an area. Exceptions
to these time frames are specified below:
            (1)   Where the initiation of stabilization measures is precluded
by snow cover, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as
practicable; and
            (2)   In areas where construction activity has temporarily ceased
and will resume after 14 days, a temporary stabilization method may be used.
         i.   Disturbance of steep slopes shall be minimized. Areas or
embankments having slopes steeper than 3:1 shall be stabilized with staked in
place sod, erosion control blanket in combination with seeding, or an
equivalent control measure.
         j.   The interior side slopes of all stormwater management facilities
shall be stabilized with staked in place sod, erosion control blanket in
combination with seeding, or an equivalent control measure. The control measure
shall be installed between the design high water level and the bottom of the
facility in a dry bottom stormwater management facility, or between the design
high water level and the normal water level for all other stormwater management
facilities.
         k.   Perimeter control measures shall be provided downslope and
perpendicular to the flow of runoff from disturbed areas, where the tributary
area is greater than 5,000 square feet, and where runoff will flow in a sheet
flow manner. Perimeter erosion control shall also be provided at the base of
soil stockpiles. Acceptable perimeter control measures include:
            (1)   Silt fences meeting the standards and specifications of the
Illinois Urban Manual or AASHTO Standard Specification 288-00;
            (2)   A vegetated filter strip, meeting the following standards:
               i.   A minimum width of 25 feet perpendicular to the flow of
runoff; and
               ii.    Vegetation consists of native plants, turf grass, or
other plants that cover 70% or more of the ground surface; or
            (3)   An equivalent control measure. The Enforcement Officer may
allow agricultural crops as a perimeter control measure, if such measures are
projected to control erosion as well as other typical perimeter controls. The
appropriateness of agricultural crops as a perimeter control measure depends on
development site specific considerations, such as the ground slope, type of
crop, and the distance to the nearest channel or adjacent property.
         l.   The stormwater management system shall be protected from erosion
and sedimentation downslope from disturbed areas. Inlet protection that reduces
sediment loading, while allowing runoff to enter the inlet shall be required
for all storm sewers. Check dams, or an equivalent control measure, shall be
required for all channels. Filter fabric inlet protection and straw bale ditch
checks are not acceptable control measures.
         m.   If dewatering services are used, discharges shall be routed
through an effective sediment control measure (e.g., sediment trap or an
equivalent control measure). The Enforcement Officer shall be notified prior to
the commencement of dewatering activities.
         n.   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final stabilization of the development site is
achieved or after the temporary measures are no longer necessary. Trapped
sediment shall be removed and disturbed areas shall be permanently stabilized.
         o.   Stockpiled soil and materials shall be removed from flood hazard
areas at the end of each work day. Soil and materials stockpiled in IWMC or
buffer areas shall be placed on timber mats, or an equivalent control measure.
         p.   Effective control measures shall be utilized to minimize the
discharge of pollutants from the development site. At a minimum, control
measures shall be implemented in order to:
            (1)   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and
vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash water; and
            (2)   Minimize the exposure of building materials, building
products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers,
pesticides, herbicides, detergents, vehicle fluids, sanitary waste, and other
materials present on the development site to precipitation and to stormwater.
         q.   Adequate receptacles shall be provided for the depositing of all
construction material debris generated during the development process. The
applicant shall not cause or permit the dumping, depositing, dropping,
throwing, discarding or leaving of construction material debris upon or into
any development site, channel, or IWMC. The development site shall be
maintained free of construction material debris.
         r.   Where regulated development is allowed within a buffer area,
construction fencing shall be installed a minimum of 1 foot outside the WOTUS
or IWMC and all other regulated development shall be limited to the non-WOTUS
or non-IWMC side of the construction fence. This requirement shall not apply to
regulated development involving impacts to or enhancement of WOTUS or IWMC.
         s.   The Enforcement Officer may require additional or alternate soil
erosion and sediment control measures, based on development site specific
considerations and the effectiveness of the installed control measures.
      2.   Requirements for Development Disturbing 1 Acre or More. In addition
to the Basic Requirements, the following requirements apply to Major
Development, Public Road Development and Mining Development disturbing 1 acre
or more.
         a.   Meet the requirements of IEPA General NPDES Permit No. ILR10, if
applicable.

street cleaning as accumulations warrant and transported to a controlled
sediment disposal area.
         c.   Structural control measures shall be utilized, when necessary, to
treat wash water, divert flows from exposed soils, store flows or otherwise
limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from exposed areas of the
development site. Such practices may include: earth dikes, drainage swales,
sediment traps, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, level
spreaders, storm drain inlet protection, rock outlet protection, reinforced
soil retaining systems, gabions, and sediment basins.
         d.   Unless otherwise specified in this Ordinance or in the Illinois
Urban Manual, the structural practices shall be designed for a storm event
equal to or greater than a 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         e.   Sediment traps and sediment basins shall be appropriately sized

regard to the size of the tributary area:
            (1)   Runoff from disturbed areas with more than 1 but fewer than 5
acres of tributary area shall be routed to a sediment trap, or an equivalent
control measure;
            (2)   Runoff from disturbed areas with a tributary area of 5 acres
or more shall be routed to a sediment basin with a perforated filtered riser
pipe, or an equivalent control measures; and
            (3)   Sediment basins shall have both a permanent pool (dead
storage) and additional volume (live storage). Each volume shall, at a minimum,
be equal to the amount of runoff from a 2 year, 24 hour storm over the onsite
hydrologically disturbed tributary area. The live storage volume may be
determined using the Detention Volume vs. Percent Impervious Chart in
Appendix 6 and the developed condition percent impervious area. The available
sediment volume below the normal water level shall be in addition to the dead
storage volume and shall be sized for the estimated sediment load generated
from the development site over the duration of the construction period. For
construction periods exceeding 1 year, the 1 year sediment load may be utilized
with an annual sediment removal schedule.
      3.   Channel Requirements. In addition to other applicable Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control Performance Standards, the following requirements apply to
regulated development below the ordinary high water mark of channels.
         a.   Land disturbance in channels shall be avoided, where possible.
The following requirements shall be met when land disturbance below the
ordinary high water mark of channels cannot be avoided:
            (1)   Disturbance shall be timed to occur during low-flow or no-

         a.   Development plans bearing the approval stamp of the Enforcement
Officer shall be retained at the development site throughout the duration of
construction activities and shall be annotated with field changes.
         b.   Disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized and areas
used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be
inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the
drainage system. Structural control measures identified in the plans shall be
observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Discharge locations shall
be inspected to evaluate whether soil erosion and sediment control measures are
effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters. Locations
where vehicles enter or exit the development site shall be inspected for

greater rain event or a discharge due to snowmelt.
            (9)   Inspections may be reduced to once per month when
construction activities have ceased due to frozen conditions. Weekly
inspections will recommence when construction activities are conducted, or if
there is 0.5 inch or greater rain event, or a discharge due to snowmelt occurs.
         d.   For regulated development disturbing less than 1 acre, an
inspector (provided by the applicant) shall inspect the development site at
intervals in subsections A.4.c.(1), A.4.c.(3), A.4.c.(4), A.4.c.(6), A.4.c.(7)
and A.4.(c)(8) of the above list.
         e.   Inspections may be reduced to once per month when construction
activities have ceased due to frozen ground conditions. Weekly inspections
shall resume when construction activities resume, within 24 hours of the end of
a storm that is 0.5 inch or greater, or when snowmelt results in a discharge
from the development site.
         f.   Inspection reports shall be retained at the development site
throughout the duration of construction activities, and made available to the
Enforcement Officer upon request. The reports shall include:
            (1)   The scope of the inspection;

shall be maintained in an effective working condition throughout the duration
of construction activities. Deficiencies shall be identified through regular
inspections, summarized in inspection reports, and repaired or replaced
immediately. The Enforcement Officer shall be notified of any Incidence of
Noncompliance filed with the IEPA and whenever an ineffective control measure
needs to be replaced with an alternative control measure.
      5.   Notification Requirements. The following requirements apply to all
regulated development, except regulated development authorized by a General
Permit.
         a.   To facilitate inspections by the Enforcement Officer and to
ensure compliance with the stormwater management permit, and this Ordinance,
the applicant shall notify the Enforcement Officer within 2 working days of the
construction stages specified below:
            (1)   For regulated development disturbing 1 acre or more:
               i.    Prior to the start of construction;
               ii.    Upon completion of installation of soil erosion and
sediment control measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior
to proceeding with any other earth disturbance or grading;
               iii.    After stripping and clearing;
               iv.    After rough grading;
               v.    After final grading;
               vi.    After seeding and land-scaping; and
               vii.    After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to

               viii.   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are
to be done in phases or areas, the applicant shall give notice at the
completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area.
            (2)   For regulated development disturbing less than 1 acre,
notifications are required at stages in subsections A.5.a.(1)i., A.5.a.(1)ii.,
A.5.a.(1)iv., and A.5.a.(1)vii. of the above list.
      6.   Special Precautions.
         a.   If at any stage of the construction, the Enforcement Officer
determines that the nature of the regulated development is such that further
work authorized by an issued stormwater management permit is likely to imperil
any property, public way, IWMC, WOTUS, buffer area, or stormwater management
system, the Enforcement Officer may require, as a condition of allowing the
work to be continued, that reasonable special precautions be taken to avoid the
likelihood of such peril. Special precautions may include, but shall not be
limited to: constructing a more level exposed slope; constructing additional
drainage facilities, berms, or terraces; compaction, or cribbing; temporary or
permanent stabilization; or hiring a professional consultant to recommend
corrective actions.
         b.   Where it appears that damage may occur due to incomplete grading
at the development site, work may be stopped and the applicant required to
install temporary structures, or take such other measures as may be required to
protect adjoining property or the public safety prior to the advent of seasonal
rains or winter shut-down. For regulated development disturbing 1 acre or more,
or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Enforcement Officer may require
that the operations be conducted in specific stages, so as to insure the
completion of protective measures or devices.
   B.   Runoff Control.
      1.   Basic Requirements. The following requirements apply to all
regulated development, except regulated development authorized by a General
Permit.
         a.   All concentrated stormwater discharges from a development site

with adequate downstream stormwater capacity and shall not result in flood
damage.
         b.   The diversion of stormwater runoff shall be prohibited unless no
reasonable alternative exists, as determined by the Enforcement Officer. The
diversion of stormwater runoff shall not result in flood damage at the
development site, upstream of the development site, or on downstream adjoining
properties.
         c.   Within a development site, streets, blocks, lots, deed or plat
restrictions, parks and other public grounds shall be located in such a manner
as to preserve natural streams and channels.

professional engineer that accounts for changes in the drainage of surface
water in accordance with the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/2).
         g.   The plats for subdivisions, Planned Unit Developments, and
manufactured home parks shall specify the minimum low opening elevation for
each lot adjacent to an overland flow path, the minimum lowest adjacent grade
for each lot adjacent to a flood hazard area, and the maximum impervious area
allowed on each lot for the provided stormwater storage volume.
         h.   The stormwater management system for a regulated development
shall be functional prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or a
certificate of completion for any building which is part of the regulated

area greater than 5 acres platted after December 1, 2014 shall state the
maximum impervious area allowed for each lot or parcel of land based on the
design of the stormwater management system.
         l.   Pursuant to State law, a property owner of a parcel being
subdivided adjacent to a State or County right-of-way shall notify the highway
authority of the proposed subdivision in writing, and request that the highway
authority provide, at the cost of the highway authority or otherwise provided
by law, the amount of additional capacity in any stormwater detention facility
to be constructed in the subdivision for the future availability of the highway
authority for meeting stormwater detention requirements of any future public
construction on the highway.
         m.   A maintenance plan shall be recorded for the stormwater
management system. The Enforcement Officer may waive this requirement for Minor
and Intermediate Development.
      2.   Overland Flow Paths. In addition to other applicable Runoff Control
Performance Standards, the following requirements apply to all regulated
development, except regulated development authorized by a General Permit.
         a.   An overland flow path shall be provided for all areas of a
development site. The overland flow path shall convey floodwaters for all storm
events up to and including the base flood event without flood damage at the
development site or upstream of the development site. Where the tributary area
is less than 20 acres, the storm sewers and inlets may be sized for the base
flood event in lieu of providing an overland flow path.
         b.   An overland flow path serving more than one property shall be
protected from obstructions, such as fencing, landscaping, or storage sheds
through a deed or plat restriction. The Enforcement Officer may waive the
requirement for a deed or plat restriction where an increase in flood heights
on upstream adjoining properties is unlikely to result from obstruction of the
overland flow path.
         c.   The overland flow path shall be designed to:
            (1)   Ensure the freeboard requirement of this Ordinance is met;
            (2)   Prevent an increase flood heights on upstream adjoining
properties; and
            (3)   Prevent flood damage at the development site.
         d.   The overland flow path shall be designed using a model or
technique identified in Appendix 5 of this Ordinance or otherwise approved by
MCSC, based on the flow rate for:
            (1)   The base flood event considering all onsite and offsite
tributary areas; or
            (2)    Conveyance of a minimum of 1 cfs per acre of tributary area.
         e.   The minimum low opening elevation for a new building that is
located adjacent to an overland flow path and has not been wet floodproofed
according to the Building Protection Standards of this Ordinance, shall meet
the following freeboard requirement:
            (1)   At least 0.5 foot above the BFE where the tributary area is
20 acres or less; or
            (2)   At least 1.0 foot above the BFE where the tributary area is
between 20 and 100 acres; or
            (3)   At least 2.0 feet above the BFE where the tributary area is
100 acres or more.
         f.   Modification of an existing overland flow path shall not result
in increased flood heights on upstream adjoining properties or flood damage at
the development site.
      3.   Drain Tiles. In addition to other applicable Runoff Control
Performance Standards, the following requirements apply to all regulated
development, except regulated development authorized by a General Permit.
         a.   Drain tiles disturbed during regulated development shall be
reconnected by those responsible for their disturbance, unless the development
plans specify abandonment of the drain tiles.
         b.   All abandoned drain tiles within disturbed areas shall be removed
in their entirety.
         c.   Drain tiles within the disturbed area of a development site shall
be replaced, bypassed around the development site or intercepted and connected
to the stormwater management system for the development site. The size of the
replaced or bypassed drain tile shall be equivalent to the existing drain tile.
         d.   Existing drain tiles shall be protected from an adverse tailwater
condition due to a new stormwater management system.
         e.   Observation wells, or similar structures for inspecting and
maintaining drain tiles, shall be installed at any point where an existing
drain tile flows into or out of a development site. Maintenance access shall be
provided to the observation well through a deed or plat restriction for
regulated development disturbing 5 acres or more.
         f.   A drain tile survey shall locate existing farm and storm drain
tiles by means of slit trenching or other appropriate methods performed by an
experienced subsurface drainage consultant. A drain tile survey shall include
the following as applicable on a topographic map:
            (1)   The location of each slit trench identified to correspond
with the tile investigation report and field staked at no less than 50 foot
intervals;
            (2)   The location of each drain tile with a flow direction arrow,
tile size and any connection to adjoining properties;
            (3)   A summary of the tile investigation report showing trench
identification number, tile size, material and quality, percentage of the tile
filled with water, percentage of restrictions caused by sediment; depth of
ground cover and tile system classification; and
            (4)   The name, address and phone number of the person or
consultant responsible for the drain tile survey.
         g.   The Enforcement Officer may accept a drain tile map prepared by a
drainage district or other reliable source in lieu of a drain tile survey. The
drain tile survey requirement shall be waived for any Minor Development and the
Enforcement Officer may waive the drain tile survey requirement for an
Intermediate Development, Major Development, Public Road Development or Mining
Development, provided the applicant submits a narrative and supporting evidence
indicating to the satisfaction of the Enforcement Officer that drain tiles are
not likely to be present within the development site. This evidence may consist
of:
            (1)   Soil maps;
            (2)   Historic aerial photographs;
            (3)   Historic topographic maps; and
            (4)   Wetland maps.
      4.   Storm Sewers. In addition to other applicable Runoff Control
Performance Standards, the following requirements apply to all regulated
development, except regulated development authorized by a General Permit.
         a.   Storm sewers shall not connect to sanitary sewers.
         b.   Energy dissipation devices shall be provided at the outlets of
all storm sewer systems to minimize erosion.
         c.   New storm sewers serving new regulated development shall be
designed by a licensed professional engineer for the 10 year critical duration
storm as a minimum. The storm sewer design shall be based on full flow
conditions, unless detailed calculations demonstrate the hydraulic grade line
would not exceed the ground elevation. The Enforcement Officer may waive this
requirement when storm sewers are not necessary for the development site to
meet the requirements of this Ordinance.
         d.   New inlets shall be designed to prevent ponding in streets from
exceeding 0.5 foot during the 100 year storm and to prevent ponding in parking
lots from exceeding 1.0 foot during the 100 year storm. Ponding depth shall be
measured at the inlet. The Enforcement Officer may waive this requirement when
storm sewers are not necessary for the development site to meet the
requirements of this Ordinance.
         e.   The minimum full flow velocity for new storm sewers serving new
regulated development shall be 2.5 feet per second. The maximum full flow
velocity for new storm sewers serving new regulated development shall be 8.0
feet per second. The Enforcement Officer may waive this requirement when storm
sewers are not necessary for the development site to meet the requirements of
this Ordinance.
         f.   The minimum storm sewer size shall be 12 inches for storm sewers
serving more than one property. The Enforcement Officer may waive this
requirement when storm sewers are not necessary for the development site to
meet the requirements of this Ordinance.
         g.   New storm sewers serving more than one property shall be located
in a deed or plat restriction of sufficient size to maintain and re-construct
the storm sewer. The Enforcement Officer may waive the requirement for a deed
or plat restriction where an increase in flood heights on upstream adjoining
properties is unlikely to result from the lack of maintenance of the storm
sewer.
      5.   Runoff Rate Reduction. In addition to other applicable Runoff
Control Performance Standards, the following requirements apply to all
regulated development required to provide stormwater storage.
         a.   Stormwater Storage Requirements.
            (1)   Stormwater storage shall be required for a regulated
development that creates 20,000 square feet or more new impervious area, unless
the conditions of subsections B.5.a.(1)i., B.5.a.(1)ii., or B.5.a.(1)iii. are
met:
               i.   1.0 acre or less of new impervious area is created; and
                  (a)    The total impervious area including the proposed
development would not exceed 10% of the contiguous property; and
                  (b)    The applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Enforcement Officer that there is adequate downstream stormwater capacity and
the development shall not result in flood damage; or
               ii.   The total impervious area including the proposed
development would not exceed 5% of the contiguous property; and
                  (a)    An agricultural conservation easement or other
conservation easement is recorded over sufficient undeveloped area that the
total impervious area may not exceed 5% of the contiguous property. The
easement shall be granted to McHenry County or a Certified Community. The
easement may be temporary, but the term of the easement shall run until the
stormwater storage waiver is no longer necessary, for reasons such as the
removal of new impervious area or the installation of a stormwater management
facility; and
                  (b)    The applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Enforcement Officer that there is adequate downstream stormwater capacity and
the development shall not result in flood damage; or
               iii.   The regulated development is a Public Road Development
and less than 1.5 acres of new impervious area is created.
            (2)   Linear impervious areas, such as a widened road, driveways
and public recreational trails, which are less than 12.4 feet wide (1.5 acres
per lineal mile) may be excluded when calculating the new impervious area to
determine whether stormwater storage is required. This exclusion shall apply
only when determining whether stormwater storage is required and not to the
design of a stormwater management facility in cases where stormwater storage is
required.
         b.   Allowable Release Rates.
            (1)   The allowable release rates for a development site shall be
calculated based on the hydrologically disturbed area of the regulated
development, except that the allowable release rate for a Public Road
Development involving an existing linear impervious surface shall be based on
the new impervious area, rather than the hydrologically disturbed area.
            (2)   Release rates for a detention facility shall not exceed the
lesser of the following:
               i.   0.04 cubic feet per second per acre for the 2 year, 24 hour
storm and 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre for the 100 year, 24 hour storm;
               ii.    More restrictive release for the 2 year and 100 year
storm rates, if adopted by the MCSC or a Certified Community; or
               iii.   The existing conditions peak runoff rate.
            (3)   The allowable release rates for a detention facility shall be
utilized for the design of an infiltration facility, unless the Enforcement
Officer approves a design based on the infiltration rate of the underlying
soil, as determined by a qualified professional. In such a case, the
Enforcement Officer may add special conditions to the approval, such as a
performance guarantee or a design factor of safety.
         c.   Runoff Rates and Storage Volume.
            (1)   The required stormwater storage volume may be determined by:
               i.   The Detention Volume vs. Percent Impervious Chart in
Appendix 6 for stormwater management facilities with a tributary area less than
10 acres, provided that the allowable release rates are 0.04 cubic feet per
second per acre for the 2 year storm and 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre
for the 100 year storm; or
               ii.   A licensed professional engineer using a model or
technique identified in Appendix 5 of this Ordinance or otherwise approved by
MCSC or IDNR/OWR.
            (2)   Runoff calculations for all offsite tributary areas may be
based on either the anticipated future land use conditions or existing land use
conditions. Anticipated future land use conditions shall be based on future
land use and existing offsite stormwater management facilities. Existing land
use conditions shall be based on existing land use and existing offsite
stormwater management facilities.
            (3)    Compensatory storage for flood storage volume lost in a
depressional storage area may either be:
               i.    Added to the required 2 year stormwater storage volume; or
               ii.    Replaced as a new depressional storage area.
            (4)   The Enforcement Officer may waive the requirement to add
compensatory storage volume to the required detention storage volume if
accessing the compensatory storage volume would:
               i.    Require a control structure with a diameter smaller than
the minimum diameter; or
               ii.    Result in a dewatering time that exceeds the maximum
dewatering time.
            (5)   Any regulated development that results in impervious area
exceeding the design parameters of an existing detention or infiltration
facility shall either expand the existing stormwater management facility, or
include a control measure designed to reduce the additional volume of runoff
from the regulated development, such as a rain garden or the replacement of
existing impervious pavement with permeable pavement.
         d.   Stormwater Management Facilities.
            (1)   Basic Requirements. The following requirements apply to the
stormwater management facilities for all regulated development required to meet
the Stormwater Storage Requirements of this Ordinance.
               i.    Offsite runoff may be bypassed around a proposed
stormwater management facility.
               ii.    Stormwater management facilities shall be sized for the
runoff from any public road improvements required as part of the regulated
development.
               iii.    Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to
dewater within 72 hours following the end of the design storm.
               iv.   A stable overflow shall be provided for each stormwater
management facility. The overflow shall be capable of passing the unattenuated
inflow from the 100 year critical duration storm from the entire tributary area
without increasing flood heights on upstream adjoining properties or resulting
in flood damage at the development site, based on runoff calculations meeting
the Runoff Rates and Storage Volume Standards of this Ordinance. The overflow
elevation shall be at or above the 100 year design high water elevation.
               v.   A minimum freeboard of one foot shall be provided above the
design high water surface elevation of the 100 year flow through the overflow.
               vi.    Stormwater management facilities serving more than one
property shall be located in a deed or plat restriction with access to the
stormwater management facility from the public right-of-way. The Enforcement
Officer may waive the requirement for a deed or plat restriction where an
increase in flood heights on upstream properties is unlikely to result from the
lack of maintenance of the stormwater management facility.
               vii.   The applicant shall notify adjoining downstream property
owner(s) via certified mail return receipt of any proposed stormwater
management facility outlet location and design. Notification shall occur prior
to preliminary Planned Unit Development or Plat of Subdivision or shall be
provided at the first permit application submittal, whichever is earlier.
               viii.   The applicant shall notify any drainage district within
the watershed where the development site is located via certified mail return
receipt of any proposed stormwater management facility outlet location and
design. Notification shall occur prior to preliminary Planned Unit Development
or Plat of Subdivision or shall be provided at the first permit application
submittal, whichever is earlier.
               ix.    Concentrated discharges from a development site shall be
connected to an existing drain tile, where possible; however, the primary
outlet from the development site should be a surface discharge and the drain
tile connection shall be designed as a secondary, low flow outlet. When no
reasonable alternative exists, the Enforcement Officer may approve the
connection of a concentrated discharge from a development site to an existing
drain tile as the primary outlet, provided the existing drain tile has adequate
hydraulic capacity and structural integrity and is located within a recorded
deed or plat restriction to the point it discharges into a channel. The deed or
plat restriction must be approved by the Enforcement Officer prior to issuance
of a stormwater management permit.
               x.    Stormwater management facility discharges onto adjoining
properties shall be designed to release as sheet flow using a level spreader,
or other energy dissipation device, approved by the Enforcement Officer.
               xi.   An off-site outfall shall be constructed to convey the
release from a stormwater management facility if an analysis demonstrates that
adequate downstream stormwater capacity cannot be achieved or if land damage to
an agricultural swale may occur.
                  (a)    The off-site outfall shall be evaluated to the nearest
open channel. If the outfall is located within a publicly owned storm drainage
system, it shall be evaluated to the downstream location directed by the
Enforcement Officer.
                  (b)    Stormwater manage-ment facility discharges to
downstream agricultural surface drainage systems with no base flow must be
conveyed 100% underground within forty-eight (48) hours after a storm event up
to and including the 100 year, 24 hour storm event.
                  (c)    Off-site outfalls shall be located within a public
right-of-way or deed or plat restricted area and marked on the as-built plans.
The deed or plat restriction language shall clearly define the individual or
entity responsible for perpetual maintenance.
                  (d)    If an off-site outfall is required to be constructed
and the downstream property owner(s) refuse(s) to grant access across his or
her property, and construction within a right-of-way or alternate route is not
feasible or reasonable, the applicant shall provide the Enforcement Officer a

      1 2.    Substantial Improvement Standards. In addition to other
applicable Flood Hazard Area Performance Standards, the following requirements
apply to any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
activity to a building within a floodplain.
         a.   Determining substantial improve-ment. The repair or improvement
of a building shall be considered a substantial improvement if either of the
following criteria is met:
            (1)   The cost of a single project or the value of damage caused by
a single event equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building
before the improvement or repair is started; or
            (2)   The cumulative cost of two or more projects requiring a
building permit or a stormwater management permit over a 5 year period equals
or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building tracked on a
percentage basis for each project.
         b.   Determining the cost.
            ( 1)   A detailed and complete cost estimate shall be prepared by
the applicant on a form provided by McHenry County. The cost estimate may
exclude items not considered a permanent part of the building (i.e., plans,
surveys, or permits), but shall include the cost of:
               i.    Damages of any origin, regardless of the actual repair
work; and
               ii.    Maintenance of existing buildings that was or will be
part of a larger project requiring a building permit or a stormwater management
permit.
            (2)   The cost estimate shall be based on pre-damage costs, if
applicable.
            (3)   The cost of all materials shall be equal to the actual or
estimated fair market value of the materials. Where materials or servicing
equipment are donated or discounted below normal market value, the cost shall
be adjusted to fair market value.
            (4)   The cost of all labor shall be equal to the actual or
estimated fair market value of the labor. Where volunteer or discounted labor
is involved, the cost of the labor shall be adjusted to fair market value.
         c.   Determining the market value.
            (1)   A signed and notarized market value determination shall be
prepared on a form provided by McHenry County. The market value may be
determined by:
               i.    Multiplying the current tax assessed value of the building
by three. The current tax assessed value shall exclude:
                  (a)    The value of the land; and
                  (b)    The value of any other buildings or exterior
improvements on the land; or
               ii.   A certified appraisal prepared by a state licensed
appraiser, completed within the previous two years, and based on the comparable
sales method;
               iii.   An estimate prepared and sealed by a licensed architect;
or
               iv.   An alternate approach, approved by the Enforcement
Officer, provided that the building does not have a tax assessed value and the
cost estimate is clearly less than 50 percent of the market value.
            (2)   The market value shall be based on the value prior to any
construction or damages, if applicable.
         d.   Determining the cumulative percentage. 
            (1)   The percentage for each individual project shall be
determined by dividing the cost of the project (at the time the project was
completed, including the full cost of any damage, if applicable) by the value
of the structure (at the time the project was completed, or prior to any
damage, if applicable); and
            (2)   Adding the percentages of each individual project.
         e.   Substantial improvements to buildings shall meet the Building
Protection Standards for Flood Hazard Areas of this Ordinance.
      13.   Compensatory Storage Volume Standards. The following requirements
apply to all regulated development resulting in flood storage volume lost or
displaced due to the placement of fill, materials, or structures in a flood
hazard area, or due to draining a depressional storage area, except regulated
development authorized by a General Permit or specifically exempted below.

         a.   Compensatory storage exemptions.
            (1)    Compensatory storage may be waived through a written waiver
by the Enforcement Officer for up to 5 cubic yards of fill within the flood
fringe or a flood prone area. This waiver may only be exercised one time per
parcel. The Enforcement Officer may deny the waiver for reasons including, but
not limited to:
               i.   A determination that the fill would create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity; or
               ii.   That a parcel has been subdivided to qualify for more than
one waiver.
            (2)    Compensatory storage shall not be required for replacement
onsite waste disposal systems within the flood fringe or a flood prone area.
The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Enforcement Officer
that no reasonable alternative location exists outside of the flood hazard area
and that the fill volume is the minimum necessary.
            (3)    Compensatory storage shall not be required for the
floodproofing of existing lawful habitable residential or commercial buildings
within 10 feet of the outside face of the building.
            (4)    Compensatory storage shall not be required to replace the
loss of artificially created storage due to a reduction in upstream head loss
caused by a bridge, culvert, storm sewer, or constructed embankment.

7   As-built plans shall be required for any regulated development resulting in
100 cubic yards or more of fill in a flood hazard area.
 
         b.   Compensatory storage require-ments.
            (1)    Compensatory storage volume shall be provided below the BFE
and above the normal water level.
            (2)   As-built plans shall be required for any regulated
development resulting in 100 cubic yards or more of fill in a flood hazard
area. The Enforcement Officer may require as-built plans for regulated
development resulting in smaller
amounts of fill in a flood hazard area based on development site specific
considerations.
            (3)   For regulated development in a riverine flood hazard area:
               i.    Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage volume shall
be provided at ratios at least equal to:
                  (a)    1.5 times the flood storage volume lost or displaced;
or
                  (b)    1.2 times the flood storage volume lost or displaced,
provided that as-built plans are submitted.
               ii.   For a Public Road Development that cannot reasonably
provide the compensatory storage volume required by this Ordinance:
                  (a)    The hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage
volume required at a minimum 1:1 ratio may be waived by the Enforcement Officer
as long as the total compensatory storage ratio is at least equal to 1:1. The
waiver shall be the minimum necessary to afford relief. Any compensatory
storage within a designated floodway shall be approved by IDNR/OWR.
                  (b)    The additional compensatory storage volume required
beyond a 1:1 ratio may be waived by the Enforcement Officer. The waiver shall
be the minimum necessary to afford relief.
               iii.   Any additional compensatory storage volume required
beyond a 1:1 ratio may be provided above or below the 10 year flood elevation.
               iv.   The compensatory storage area shall be located in close
proximity to the fill area and shall drain freely and openly to the channel.
            (4)   For regulated development in a non-riverine flood hazard
area:
               i.   The compensatory storage volume shall be at least equal to
the flood storage volume lost or displaced; and
               ii.   The compensatory storage volume lost by filling or
draining a depressional storage area shall be based on the critical duration
storm.
      14.   Public Flood Control Project Standards. The Flood Hazard Area
Performance Standards of this Ordinance shall be considered met for any public
flood control project that meets all the following criteria.
         a.   Flood heights shall not be increased outside a deed or plat
restriction for all flood events up to and including the base flood event.
         b.   The improvements shall be owned and maintained by a public
agency. A land stewardship corporation, or similar entity, may own and maintain
the improvements, provided that a public agency executes an agreement with the
corporation to take over ownership, operation, and maintenance if the
corporation dissolves or fails to meet its obligations.
         c.   A CLOMR and a LOMC from FEMA shall be required, with approval
from IDNR/OWR, for any regulated development that:
            (1)   Increases the water surface profile by 0.1 foot or more in a
floodplain for any storm event up to and including the base flood event;
            (2)   Revises the boundary of a floodplain by the placement of
fill; or
            (3)   Revises the boundary of a floodway.
      15.   Standards for On-Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing
Up Water.
         a.   Any water surface profile increase shall:
            (1)   Be contained within the banks of the water body; or
            (2)   Be contained within the development site, property in which
the applicant has an ownership interest, or a deed or plat restriction; or
            (3)   Not exceed 0.1 foot upstream flood height increase for all
events up to and including the base flood event.
         b.   All dams and impoundment structures shall meet the applicable
requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of
Dams).
         c.   If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel
or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
            (1)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
            (2)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning;
            (3)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measure, and a pre-sedimentation
basin; and
            (4)   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.
      16.   Bridge and Culvert Standards.
         a.   Designated Floodways.
            (1)   New bridges and culverts.
               i.   Any water surface profile increase shall:
                  (a)    Be contained within the banks of the water body; or
                  (b)    Be contained within the development site, property in
which the applicant has an ownership interest, or a deed or plat restriction;
or
               ii.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot for all flood events up to and
including the base flood event; and
               iii.   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 foot within a designated floodway, the applicant shall
contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver.
            (2)    Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts
and approach roads.
               i.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction
or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the base flood event, if the existing bridge or culvert is not a
source of flood damage.
               ii.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is
a source of flood damage to buildings in the upstream floodplain, the
applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
               iii.   The determination as to whether or not the existing
crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared
in accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         b.   Non-Designated Floodways and Flood Prone Areas.
            (1)   New bridges and culverts.
               i.    Documentation must be provided that the proposed crossing
will not cause demonstrable flood damage; and
               ii.   Any water surface profile increase shall:
                  (a)    Be contained within the banks of the water body; or
                  (b)    Be contained within the development site, property in
which the applicant has an ownership interest, or a deed or plat restriction;
or
               iii.   In urban areas, the water surface profile increase would
not exceed 0.5 foot at the structure, nor 0.1 foot at a point 1000 feet
upstream of the structure, for all flood events up to and including the base
flood event, as determined by the horizontal projection of the increase and the
slope of the hydraulic grade line for the existing and proposed conditions
hydraulic models; or
               iv.   In rural areas, the water surface profile increase would
not exceed 1.0 foot at the structure, nor 0.5 foot at a point 1000 feet
upstream of the structure, for all flood events up to and including the base
flood event, as determined by the horizontal projection of the increase and the
slope of the hydraulic grade line for the existing and proposed conditions
hydraulic models; and
               v.   Any increase in the average channel velocity would not be
beyond the scour velocity of the predominant soil type of the channel; or
               vi.    Increased scour, erosion and sedimentation would be
prevented by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
            (2)    Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts
and approach roads.
               i.   The reconstruction (including approach roads) shall be no
more restrictive to normal and flood flows than the existing bridge or culvert
crossing; and
               ii.    Documentation must be provided that the existing crossing
has not caused demonstrable flood damage. In the case of public projects,
certification by a District Engineer of the Department of Transportation’s
Division of Highways, a County Engineer (if a licensed professional engineer),
or a Municipal Engineer (if a licensed professional engineer) that the existing
crossing has not caused demonstrable flood damage will be adequate
documentation.
   D.   Wetlands and Waters.
      1.   Minimization of Impacts. All reasonable measures shall be taken to
avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands, streams, ponds and lakes.
      2.   Jurisdictional Determination.
         a.   The applicant shall obtain a Jurisdictional Determination from
the USACE for any regulated development that impacts wetlands or waters or is
adjacent to wetlands or waters. This requirement may be waived by the
Enforcement Officer when the USACE issues a Letter of No Objection for the
regulated development.
         b.   Impacts to WOTUS shall be mitigated according to the requirements
of the USACE.
         c.   Impacts to IWMC shall be mitigated according to the requirements
of this Ordinance. No IWMC impacts shall be allowed without a clear purpose and
need for the regulated development and without demonstrating the measures taken
to avoid and minimize IWMC impacts to the satisfaction of the Enforcement
Officer.
      3.   Boundary Determination Requirements. The following requirements
apply to all regulated development within or adjacent to IWMC, except regulated
development authorized by a General Permit.
         a.   A Letter of No Impact prepared by a wetland specialist may be
accepted by the Enforcement Officer, in lieu of a Wetland Determination Report,
when a field investigation by the wetland specialist reveals the closest
wetland or waters to a regulated development is clearly beyond the limits of
the required buffer. A Letter of No Impact shall include:

         b.   The presence and boundary of waters shall be determined by a
wetland specialist. Waters shall include the entire area inundated at the
ordinary high water mark.
         c.   The presence and boundary of farmed wetlands on agricultural land
within or adjacent to a development site shall be determined by the NRCS or a
wetland specialist, in accordance with the current NRCS or USACE wetland
delineation methodology.
         d.   The presence, boundary, and quality of non-farmed wetlands within
or adjacent to a development site shall be determined by a wetland delineation
conducted in accordance with the current USACE wetland delineation methodology.
The findings of this determination shall be documented in a Wetland
Determination Report prepared by a wetland specialist.
         e.   A Wetland Determination Report shall be prepared by a wetland
specialist and shall include:
            (1)   A plan showing the location and extent of all wetlands and
waters within or adjacent to the development site. The boundaries of these
wetlands and waters shall be flagged in the field and surveyed. The approximate
location and extent of offsite wetlands and waters within 100 feet of the
development site shall also be shown. The approximate offsite boundaries shall
be established using the best available information, as approved by the
Enforcement Officer. The best available information may include:
               i.    Aerial photography;
               ii.   A previously approved Wetland Determination Report, even
if the report was prepared more than 5 years ago;
               iii.   The ADID Map or other wetland map; and
               iv.    McHenry County Soil Survey;
            (2)   An aerial photograph delineating all wetlands and waters
within or adjacent to the development site, as well as the approximate location

Floristic Quality Assessment, as determined by the methodology described in
Plants of the Chicago Region (Swink, F. and G. Wilhelm, 1994, 4th Edition,
Indianapolis: Indiana Academy of Science). Floristic Quality Assessments shall
be conducted during the local growing season, generally between May 15 and
October 1. Non-growing season assessments may require additional sampling
during the growing season prior to approval.
         f.   Approval of a Wetland Determination Report shall remain valid for
5 years.
      4.   Hydrology Requirement. The following requirement applies to all
regulated development within or adjacent to IWMC, except regulated development
authorized by a General Permit.
         a.   The regulated development shall maintain 80%-150% of the existing
condition runoff volume from the development site to each IWMC for the 2 year,
24 hour storm event; otherwise the IWMC shall be considered impacted and shall
be subject to the Mitigation Requirements of this Ordinance.
      5.   Mitigation Requirements. The following requirements apply to all
regulated development resulting in an IWMC impact, except regulated development
authorized by a General Permit.
         a.   IWMC mitigation is required for regulated development resulting
in IWMC impacts greater than or equal to 0.10 acre to IWMC. The Enforcement
Officer may require mitigation for IWMC impacts less than 0.10 acre for reasons
including, but not limited to:
            (1)   The proposed regulated development would result in a
cumulative IWMC impact greater than or equal to 0.10 acre, due to a prior
unmitigated impact to the same IWMC; or

ARTICLE XI
§ 17.60.110 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   It is recognized that the degree of flood protection required by this
Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations; however, on occasion, greater floods
than the base flood will occur and will result in greater flood heights and
flood damage. Furthermore, flood heights may be increased by other man-made or
natural causes. These provisions do not imply that land outside flood hazard
areas or that uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damage. These provisions shall not create liability on the part of the
MCSC nor any Certified Community nor any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made there under.
(Ord. O-2020-09-15, passed 9-19-2020)
ARTICLE XII
§ 17.60.120 SEVERABILITY.
   A.   The provisions of this Ordinance shall be severable in accordance with
the following rules:
      1.   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision
of this Ordinance invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provision
of this Ordinance; and
      2.   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any provision of this Ordinance to a particular parcel of land,
a particular structure, or a particular development, such judgment shall not
affect the application of said provisions to any other parcel of land,
structure, or development.
   B.   All such unaffected provisions of this Ordinance shall remain in full
force and effect.
(Ord. O-2020-09-15, passed 9-19-2020)
ARTICLE XIII
§ 17.60.130 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This Ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing

§ 17.60.160 APPENDIX 2: STANDARD SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL NOTES.
   1.   Control measures shall meet the minimum standards and specifications of
the Illinois Urban Manual unless stated otherwise.
   2.   Soil disturbance shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize
erosion. Areas of the development site that are not to be disturbed shall be
protected from construction traffic or other disturbance until final
stabilization is achieved.
   3.   Soil stabilization measures shall consider the time of year,
development site conditions and the use of temporary or permanent measures.
   4.   Stabilization by seeding shall include topsoil placement and
fertilization, as necessary.
   5.   Native seed mixtures shall include rapid-growing annual grasses or
small grains to provide initial, temporary soil stabilization.
   6.   Offsite property shall be protected from erosion and sedimentation.
Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at concentrated discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel, as necessary to prevent
erosion.
   7.   Sediment control measures shall be installed prior to the disturbance
of tributary areas.
   8.   Stabilization of disturbed areas shall be initiated immediately
whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth disturbing activities
have permanently ceased on any portion of the development site, or temporarily
ceased on any portion of the development site and will not resume for a period
exceeding 14 calendar days. Stabilization of disturbed areas shall be initiated
within 1 working day of permanent or temporary cessation of earth disturbing
activities and shall be completed as soon as possible, but not later than 14
calendar days from the initiation of stabilization work in an area. Exceptions
to these time frames are specified below:
      a.   Where the initiation of stabilization measures is precluded by snow
cover, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; and
      b.   In areas where construction activity has temporarily ceased and will
resume after 14 days, a temporary stabilization method may be used.
   9.   Disturbance of steep slopes shall be minimized. Areas or embankments
having slopes steeper than 3:1 shall be stabilized with staked in place sod,
erosion control blanket in combination with seeding, or an equivalent control
measure.
   10.   Perimeter control measures shall be provided downslope and
perpendicular to the flow of runoff from disturbed areas, where the tributary
area is greater than 5,000 square feet, and where runoff will flow in a sheet
flow manner. Perimeter erosion control shall also be provided at the base of
soil stockpiles.
   11.   The stormwater management system shall be protected from erosion and
sedimentation downslope from disturbed areas. Inlet protection that reduces
sediment loading, while allowing runoff to enter the inlet shall be required
for all storm sewers. Check dams, or an equivalent control measure, shall be
required for all channels. Filter fabric inlet protection and straw bale ditch
checks are not acceptable control measures.
   12.   If dewatering services are used, discharges shall be routed through an
effective sediment control measure (e.g., sediment trap or an equivalent
control measure). The Enforcement Officer shall be notified prior to the
commencement of dewatering activities.
   13.   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final stabilization of the development site is
achieved or after the temporary measures are no longer necessary. Trapped
sediment shall be removed and disturbed areas shall be permanently stabilized.
   14.   Stockpiled soil and materials shall be removed from flood hazard areas
at the end of each work day. Soil and materials stockpiled in IWMC or buffer
areas shall be placed on timber mats, or an equivalent control measure.
   15.   Effective control measures shall be utilized to minimize the discharge
of pollutants from the development site. At a minimum, control measures shall
be implemented in order to:
      a.   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and vehicle
washing, wheel wash water, and other wash water; and
      b.   Minimize the exposure of building materials, building products,
construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers, pesticides,
herbicides, detergents, vehicle fluids, sanitary waste, and other materials
present on the development site to precipitation and to stormwater.
   16.   Adequate receptacles shall be provided for the depositing of all
construction material debris generated during the development process. The
applicant shall not cause or permit the dumping, depositing, dropping,
throwing, discarding or leaving of construction material debris upon or into
any development site, channel, or IWMC. The development site shall be
maintained free of construction material debris.
   17.   The Enforcement Officer may require additional or alternate soil
erosion and sediment control measures, based on development site specific
considerations and the effectiveness of the installed control measures.

§ 17.60.170 APPENDIX 3: STANDARD DRAIN TILE NOTES.
   1.   Drain tiles disturbed during regulated development shall be reconnected
by those responsible for their disturbance, unless the development plans
specify abandonment of the drain tiles.
   2.   All abandoned drain tiles within disturbed areas shall be removed in
their entirety.
   3.   Drain tiles within the disturbed area of a development site shall be
replaced, bypassed around the development site or intercepted and connected to
the stormwater management system for the development site. The size of the
replaced or bypassed drain tile shall be equivalent to the existing drain tile.

§ 17.60.270 APPENDIX 12: DEFINITIONS.
   The following definitions shall be used with this Ordinance.
      accessory building: A non-habitable structure which is on the same parcel
of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
      actual start of construction: Either the first placement of permanent
construction of a building on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
      adequate downstream stormwater capacity: A downstream channel or
stormwater management system with the ability to store and convey the
anticipated 100-year stormwater runoff without increasing damage to adjoining
properties.
      Advanced Identification Wetland Study (ADID): A study conducted in
McHenry County by the USACE and the USEPA in 1997 to generate wetland maps.
      agricultural building: An accessory building that is used solely for
agricultural purposes in which the use is exclusively in connection with the
production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural
commodities, including the raising of livestock.
      agricultural land: Land predominantly used for agricultural purposes.
      agricultural swale: Grassed waterway or cultivated swale within a farm
field under agricultural production which is ephemeral in nature and does not
have a defined bed and banks.
      applicant: Any person, firm, or governmental agency who owns property or
its duly appointed representative and proposes to develop that property and
executes the necessary forms to procure a permit to obtain authorization for
such regulated development from the Enforcement Officer.
      appropriate use: The only regulated development within the designated
floodway that is permissible and will be considered for permit issuance. The
appropriate uses are determined by IDNR/OWR.
      armoring: The placement of materials (concrete, rip-rap, retaining wall,
etc.) within a channel or along a shoreline to protect property along streams,
lakes or ponds from damage caused by wave action and flowing water.
      as-built plans: Record drawings prepared by a licensed land surveyor or
licensed professional engineer to confirm that a regulated development was
constructed in substantial conformance with the approved plans.
      base flood: The flood having a one percent probability of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100 year
flood event.
      base flood elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation that can be
expected during the base flood. Determination of the BFE at any location is as
described in the Flood Hazard Areas section of this Ordinance.
      basement: Any area of a building having its floor below ground level on
all sides.
      best management practice (BMP): Land planning and engineered practices
designed to reduce soil erosion, sediment deposition, and water quality impacts
of development.
      boardwalk: A walkway constructed of wooden, composite, metallic, or other
decking material, primarily serving pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
      buffer: An area of predominantly vegetated land located adjacent to WOTUS
and IWMC for the purpose of, but not limited to, reducing contaminants in
stormwater that flows to such areas.
      building: A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
two or more rigid walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage
tank, a manufactured home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term
also includes recreational vehicles or travel trailers installed on a site for
more than 180 consecutive days.
      Certified Community: A community which has petitioned the MCSC and has
been found by the MCSC to be capable of enforcing an ordinance (or ordinances)
which contain rules and regulations which are consistent with or at least as
stringent as the regulations of this Ordinance.
      Certified Erosion, Sediment and Storm Water Inspector (CESSWI): A
certification by EnviroCert International, Inc., which can be earned by
demonstrating certain qualifications based on a combination of education and
experience, and passing an exam.
      Certified Floodplain Manager (CFM): A certification by the Association of
State Floodplain Managers, which is designed to establish educational, training
and experience criteria related to floodplain management, hazard mitigation,
National Flood Insurance Program and to certify that an individual applicant
has met these criteria.
      Certified Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC): A
certification by EnviroCert International, Inc., which can be earned by
demonstrating certain qualifications based on a combination of education and
experience, and passing an exam.
      channel: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, flow path, slough,
ditch, gully, ravine, swale, wash, or drainageway with a discernible bed and
banks, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either perennially or
intermittently.
      channel modification: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, rip-rapping or other armoring, widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody vegetation of the
channel. Channel modification does not include dredging or the clearing of
invasive, dead or dying vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel.
      Class V injection wells: Any bored, drilled, or driven shaft, or dug hole
that is deeper than its widest surface dimension, or an improved sinkhole, or a
sub-surface fluid distribution system. This includes most direct infiltration
structures such as drywells and column drains. Class V injection wells are
regulated by the IEPA and the owner of any proposed injection well is required
to submit an inventory information form prior to the infiltration structure
becoming operational.
      column drain: Any device, including drywells, which facilitates direct
infiltration of stormwater runoff below the soil layer (typically greater than
five feet).
      community: Any municipality (as defined at Ill. Rev. Stat., 1989, Ch. 24,
1-1-2 {'{'}1{'}'}) or McHenry County when providing services or applying its
regulatory authority to the unincorporated portions of the County.
      compensatory storage: An excavated volume of storage used to offset the
loss of existing flood storage volume when:
         A.   Fill, materials or structures are placed within a flood hazard
area; or
         B.   A depressional storage area is drained.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise the BFEs, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or
floodway as shown on an effective FIRM, once the as-built plans are submitted
