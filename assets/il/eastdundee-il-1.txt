NON-LIABILITY
§ 34.40 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   The village finds that it is in the public policy of the state that
members of governmental bodies shall not be liable in damages for the exercise
of their discretion in determining policies. This public policy is set forth in
ILCS Ch. 745, Act 10, § 2-201, which provides as follows:
      "Except as otherwise provided by Statute, a public employee serving in a
position involving the determination of policy or the exercise of discretion is
not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission in determining
policy when acting in the exercise of such discretion even though abused."
   (B)   (1)   In light of division (A) above, if any claim or action not
covered by insurance is instituted against any elected or appointed village
official, employee, or authorized volunteer in connection with any act or
omission in determining policy, the village shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law:
         (a)   Appear and defend against the claim or action;
         (b)   Indemnify the elected or appointed village official, employee,
or authorized volunteer for his or her court costs and attorneys' fees incurred
in the defense of such claim or action;
         (c)   Pay or indemnify the elected or appointed village official,
employee, or authorized volunteer for a judgment based upon such claim or
action; and
         (d)   Pay or indemnify the elected or appointed village official,
employee, or authorized volunteer for a compromise or settlement of such claim
or action, provided that the settlement is approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Trustees.
      (2)   The term "elected or appointed village official" shall mean any
former or current Village President, Trustee, or member of any village board,
committee and commission.
   (C)   The foregoing indemnity shall not extend to any of the following:
      (1)   Any liability, attorneys’ fees, or costs with respect to any matter
in which the elected or appointed village official, employee, or authorized
volunteer is finally adjudged to be guilty of a criminal act. (To the extent
that any criminal proceeding shall be pending at the time of indemnification or
any criminal proceeding shall thereafter be instituted, any indemnification
paid or promised shall be conditioned upon the termination of the criminal
proceeding without a finding of guilt.);
      (2)   Any liability or judgment against an elected or appointed village
official, employee, or authorized volunteer which is payable to the village
itself or where the village was injured and the elected or appointed village
official, employee, or authorized volunteer either obtained personal benefit or
financial gain as a result of his or her wrongful conduct;
      (3)   Any liability, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred as a result of a
village-initiated or approved investigation into the misconduct of the elected
or appointed village official, employee, or authorized volunteer;
      (4)   Any liability, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred as a result of
the elected or appointed village official's, employee's, or authorized
volunteer's failure to reasonably cooperate or participate in the defense of
any claim, action, suit, or proceeding with any person, party, or entity; or
      (5)   Any liability excluded by a written waiver from the elected or
appointed village official, employee, or authorized volunteer.

SURPLUS PROPERTY
§ 34.50 DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS PROPERTY.
   (A)   When the Village Administrator determines that the village owns
surplus property which is no longer necessary or useful to or for the best
interests of the village, he or she is, subject to the limitations hereinafter
set forth, authorized and directed to proceed without further authorization by
the Village Board to dispose of such village property by sale, trade-in, or any
other manner he or she considers most advantageous to the village.
   (B)   The authority granted to the Village Administrator in division (A)
above shall be limited to the disposition of any single item or any group of
items designated by the Village Administrator to be disposed of as a unit with
a value estimated by the Village Administrator to not be in excess of $100.
   (C)   In the event that the surplus village property has a value estimated
by the Village Administrator to be more than $100, but less than $5,000, the
Village Administrator shall establish a minimum bid to be accepted for each
item. After causing the surplus property to be advertised as provided in
division (E) below, the Village Administrator shall dispose of the surplus
property to the highest bidder and report the disposition to the Village Board.
   (D)   In the event that the surplus property to be disposed of has a value
estimated by the Village Administrator to be equal to or in excess of $5,000,
the Village Administrator may proceed to dispose of the same only after
establishing a minimum bid to be accepted for each item and advertising bids as
provided in division (E) below. The Village Administrator shall dispose of the
surplus property by obtaining the prior approval of the Village Board for the
disposition of surplus property in the following manner: The Village
Administrator shall submit to the Village Board a request for authorization to
dispose of such surplusage by submitting a schedule of the property and a
resolution of authorization. The Village Board may then direct the Village
Administrator to commence disposal of such surplusage.
   (E)   When the Village Administrator is obligated, pursuant to divisions (C)
and (D) hereof, to advertise items of surplus property for disposition to the
highest bidder, the following procedures shall be employed:
      (1)   Public notice of the disposition, including the time, place, terms
of disposition, and the schedule of disposition shall be posted in a public
place in the Village Hall and on the village website. Such notice of intended
sale of surplus property shall constitute notice to the general public and
anyone who may have interest in purchasing the items of surplus property. When
the Village Administrator determines that it is not practicable to so advertise
the disposition, he or she may dispose of the surplus village property in
whatever manner he or she considers most advantageous to the village.
      (2)   No sale of surplus property shall be effected by the village until
public notice required under this section shall have been posted for seven
days, and thereafter, the Village Administrator is authorized to proceed to
deliver a bill of sale for any or all of such items.
   (F)   If the village is unable to sell its surplus property after
solicitation to the public as referred to herein, the village may donate the
property to any not-for-profit corporation, organization, or entity as
determined by I.R.C. § 501(c)(3), having its principal place of business or
doing a substantial amount of business in the village, or if none can be found
within the village, then within Dundee Township. The Village Administrator
shall document the reasons as to why the materials may have been donated to a
non-village based entity.
   (G)   In all cases, excepting therefrom the on-line auction sale of surplus
property, no sale or surplus village property shall be made to a person, who
is, at the time of such sale, an officer, agent or employee of the village or
an immediate family member of the officer, agent or employee. Immediate family
member shall include spouses and dependent minor children living with the
officer, agent or employee.

(Ord. 11-54, passed 12-19-2011)
POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 34.80 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the village to prohibit harassment
of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 17-56, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 34.81 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual's employment,
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      (1)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      (2)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      (3)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      (4)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      (5)   Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
(Ord. 17-56, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 34.82 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.  
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of
the municipality.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. 17-56, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 34.83 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or
other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee, or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(a)), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a
court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal
law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (ILCS Ch.
740, Act 174, § 15(b)).
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, § 6-
101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which
he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC may file
a retaliation charge - due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 17-56, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 34.84 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or
the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. 17-56, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 34.85 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
state's attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

CASH BALANCE POLICY
§ 34.100 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Cash Balance Policy is to establish the following:
   (A)   A target level of cash balance required for the General Fund and Water
and Sewer Fund;
   (B)   A process and criteria for the continued evaluation of that target
level as conditions warrant;
   (C)   A process for reaching and/or maintaining the targeted level of cash
balance and the priority for the use of resources in excess of the target; and
   (D)   A mechanism for monitoring and reporting the General Fund and Water
and Sewer Fund cash balance.
(Ord. 21-13, passed 4-19-2021; Am. Ord. 23-15, passed 3-20-2023)
§ 34.101 BACKGROUND AND CONSIDERATIONS.
   The village's administration, credit rating agencies, and others monitor the
levels of cash balance in the General Fund and Water and Sewer Fund as an
important indicator of the village's economic condition. In establishing an
appropriate level of cash balance, the village has considered the following
factors:
   (A)   The predictability of its revenues and the volatility of its
expenditures;
   (B)   The village's perceived exposure to significant one-time outlays
(e.g., disasters, immediate capital needs, state budget cuts);
   (C)   The potential drain upon General Fund and Water and Sewer Fund
resources from other funds as well as the availability of resources in other
funds;
   (D)   Liquidity (i.e., the disparity between when financial resources
actually become available to make payments and the average maturity of related
liabilities may require that a higher level of resources be maintained); and
   (E)   Commitments and assignments (i.e., the village may wish to maintain
higher levels of unassigned cash balance to compensate for any portion of the
cash balance already committed or assigned by the government for a specific
purpose).
(Ord. 21-13, passed 4-19-2021; Am. Ord. 23-15, passed 3-20-2023)
§ 34.102 POLICY AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The following shall apply to both the General Fund and Water and Sewer
Fund. The minimum cash balance reserve to be committed shall be 25% of budgeted
expenditures. An additional 10% cash flow reserve shall be committed in each
fund for cash flow purposes. This 10% cash flow reserve shall be used at the
discretion of the Village Administrator, provided that the 10% shall only be
used for cash flow to address revenue that is expected but has not yet been
received.
   (B)   The total 35% cash balance reserve required for each fund shall be
calculated prior to the adoption of the annual budget as follows:
      Projected beginning cash balance + budgeted expenditures = 35%
   (C)   As part of the annual budget process, the Village Administrator shall
report to the Village Board the required 35% cash balance reserve. This 35%
cash balance reserve shall be held in the General Fund and Water and Sewer
Fund, respectively, and shall be approved by ordinance each year in conjunction
with the adopted budget.
   (D)   A super majority vote of five affirmative votes of the Village
President and Board of Trustees is required for the Village Board to take
action on any item that will temporarily reduce the 35% cash balance reserve
below this minimum target level, other than for cash flow purposes. In the
event that the 35% cash balance reserve drops below this minimum target level
through the approval of the Village Board, the Village Administrator will
develop a plan, implemented through the annual budgetary process, to bring the
balance back to the target level over a period of no more than three fiscal
years.
(Ord. 21-13, passed 4-19-2021; Am. Ord. 23-15, passed 3-20-2023)
§ 34.103 SURPLUS.
   (A)   General Fund. Upon determining the minimum 35% General Fund cash
balance reserve, the difference between the budgeted and actuarial Police
Pension contribution amount shall be paid, then 50% excess (surplus) shall be
transferred to the Capital Projects Fund and shall be either utilized for
budgeted capital projects or restricted for capital projects identified within
the village's capital improvement plan. These transfers shall be made as
available, recommended by the Village Administrator based upon current needs,
and approved by ordinance.
   (B)   Water and Sewer Fund. Upon determining the minimum 35% Water and Sewer
Fund cash balance reserve, any excess (surplus) shall be either utilized for
budgeted capital projects within the Water and Sewer Fund or restricted for
Water and Sewer capital projects identified within the village's capital
improvement plan, as recommended by the Village Administrator and approved by
ordinance.

refunded.

memorandum to the claimant for the amount so allowed or refund the amount in
the manner as the Board of Trustees shall determine or as set forth in division
(F)(5) below.
      (5)   In case the Board of Trustees determines that the claimant is
entitled to a refund, the refund shall be made only from the budgeted amount as
may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely that the amount
budgeted would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period covered

claimant cannot use a credit memorandum).

assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
   (K)   Abatement. The local tax administrator shall have the authority to
waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file
penalty if the local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists
for delay or failure to make a filing.
   (L)   Installment contracts. The village may enter into an installment
contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax
ordinance. The local tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract
so entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon
written notice by the local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days
delinquent, the taxpayer shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If
the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the 14 day period or fails to
demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local
administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer.
   (M)   Statute of limitations. The village, through the local tax
administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely manner and

after receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for
refund or provide any tax still due and owing.
      (1)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      (2)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
      (3)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax
return was filed by the taxpayer.
   (N)   Voluntary disclosure. For any locally imposed and administered tax for
which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation,
or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file
an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of
the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to
pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
   (O)   Publication of tax ordinances. Any locally administered tax ordinance
shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting
of a tax ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request
at the Village Clerk’s office.
   (P)   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the
lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the village’s expense;
      (2)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
      (3)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
   (Q)   Application. This section shall be liberally construed and
administered to supplement all of the village’s tax ordinances. To the extent
that any tax ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this section,
this section shall be controlling.

§ 51.36 WATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The water service charge for the use of and for service supplied by
the waterworks facilities of the village shall consist of a user charge for the
operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and other
charges as the village deems necessary.
   (B)   (1)   The user charge is levied on all users to recover the operation,
maintenance, plus replacement costs, and shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters.
      (2)   The user charge shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the annual water volume to be treated;
         (b)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the waterworks facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all work categories;
         (c)   Proportion the estimated OM&R costs to each user class; and
         (d)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons.
      (3)   The user charge is computed by dividing the number of units of flow
of water from all sources into the annual revenue required. The resultant
charge is expressed in dollars per 1,000 gallons of water.
   (C)   The debt service charge is levied on all users and may be computed by
apportioning the annual debt service in one of the following methods:
      (1)   As a charge per 1,000 gallons;
      (2)   As a fixed charge per billing period; and
      (3)   As a fixed charge plus a charge per 1,000 gallons.
   (D)   The capital improvement charge is levied as a connection fee on users
to provide for the capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the
waterworks facilities. The capital improvement charge is computed and assessed
as a fixed charge per P.E. estimated to be used by the user.
   (E)   The village may declare a rate to provide funds for such other costs
as may be applicable to the water facilities. The rate, if established, shall
be applicable to all users.
   (F)   The adequacy of the water service charge shall be reviewed, not less
often than annually, by certified public accountants for the village in their
annual audit report. The water service charge shall be revised periodically to
reflect a change in local OM&R costs.
   (G)   The users of the waterworks services will be notified annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to the water operation, maintenance and
replacement.
   (H)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges shall be
metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of 1,000 gallons.
(1981 Code, § 6.12)
§ 51.37 RATES.
   (A)   There shall be and there is hereby established a monthly user charge/
fee on a fiscal year basis, as established in the annual fee schedule, per
1,000 gallons to each user of the waterworks facility within the corporate
limits.
   (B)   There shall be and there is hereby established a monthly fixed charge/
fee on a fiscal year basis including debt service based on the size of the
water meter as established in the annual fee schedule to each user of the
waterworks facility.
   (C)   There shall be and there is hereby established a capital improvement
charge (connection fee) as established in the annual fee schedule. When an
existing service line is being upgraded, the difference between the existing
service line and the upgraded service line size will be the fee charged. The
water permit connection fee will have been paid at the time of the original
installation and will not be considered in calculations for the connection fee
when upgrading service lines.
   (D)   (1)   A minimum charge may be established in the annual fee schedule
shall be applied to all users whose consumption does not exceed a set gallonage
per billing period. This minimum charge shall be established in the annual fee
schedule. Usage in excess of the set gallonage per billing period will be
charged a fee, as established in the annual fee schedule, per 1,000 gallons.
      (2)   Where a connection services more than one dwelling unit on a
property either within the corporate limits or outside of the corporate limits,
the minimum charge shall be the number of dwelling units served by the service
times the minimum bill or the actual number of gallons used, multiplied by the
currently established water rate plus the other current charges, whichever is
greater.
   (E)   The rates and service charges established for user charges shall be
effective on bills to be rendered for the next succeeding billing period after
approval and authorization of the Village Board. A copy of the water service
charges shall be filed in the office of the Village Clerk and shall be deemed
notice to all owners of real estate of their liability for service supplied to
any user of the service of the water facilities of the village on their
properties.
   (F)   The method for computation of rates and service charges established
for user charges shall be made available to a user within 14 days of receipt of
a written report for such. Any disagreement over the method used or in the
computations thereof shall be remedied by the Director of Public Works within
14 days after notification of a formal written appeal outlining the
discrepancies.
   (G)   All rates for service to residential and for-profit properties outside
the village corporate limits shall be 150% of the rates set forth in the annual
fee schedule. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require or obligate
the village to provide the service.
   (H)   All rates for service to non-profit or governmental properties outside
the village corporate limits shall be the residential rates set forth in the
annual fee schedule. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require or
obligate the village to provide the service.

   (D)   A penalty sum established in the annual fee schedule for any check
returned for non-sufficient funds shall be added to any bill to which attempted
prior payment was made by the non-sufficient check. If there are two checks
returned from the bank within a one-year time period, no further checks shall
be accepted from the customer unless the checks are certified, until there is
an acceptable payment history for a continuous one-year period.
   (E)   Whenever a bill for water service remains unpaid for three consecutive
billing cycles for the bi-monthly service after it has been rendered it shall
be deemed and is hereby declared delinquent, as provided by law. The Director
of Finance or his or her designee may, in his or her discretion, send the
unpaid invoices to a collection agency, proceed with water service termination,
file with the county recorder of deeds a statement of lien claim or proceed
with any other remedy available to the village under this code or state or

the delinquency exists and that service shall be disconnected without further
notice. If a payment plan is required and obtained, the late fee shall be
waived after successful repayment.
      (2)   The Director of Finance or his or her designee shall also cause a
shutoff notice to be posted on the property.
      (3)   Ten days after the shut off notice has been posted, and payment not
received, all applicable utility services shall be terminated.
   (G)   Upon the disconnection of any services, a charge should be as provided
for in the village annual fee schedule shall be made for reconnecting the same
after settlement of the delinquent account.
   (H)   Any person wishing to discontinue service shall give notice to the
Director of Finance or his or her designee prior to the expiration of the time
for which payment has been made or become due and remaining unpaid; otherwise,
he or she shall be liable for the charge for the ensuing billing period.

shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her address be known to
the village, whenever the bill remains unpaid for the three consecutive billing
cycles for a bi-monthly bill after it has been rendered. The failure of the
Director of Finance or his or her designee to record the lien or to mail the
notice or the failure of the owner to receive the notice shall not affect the
right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bill as mentioned in the foregoing
section. The cost of filing the lien shall be paid by the persons responsible
for the charges covered by the unpaid bill.
   (B)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for non-
payment of the same and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the
charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory
liens. The foreclosure shall be by bill-in equity in the name of the village.
The Village Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute the
proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over
such matters against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid for a
time period as specified in the ILCS Chapter 65, Act 5, § 11-139-8.

52.01   Purpose and intent
   
52.02   Authority
   
52.03   Cross-Connection Control Policy Manual
§ 52.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this program is to protect the public potable water supply
from the possibility of contamination or pollution by eliminating or protecting
actual or potential cross-connection in the water distribution and to provide
for the operation of a continuing program to systematically and effectively
prevent a contamination or pollution of the public water supply distribution
system through cross- connections.
(Ord. 04-10, passed 4-19-2004)
§ 52.02 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   In accordance with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the
National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations were promulgated on
December 24, 1975, and became effective on June 24, 1977. These regulations
replaced the Public Health Service Drinking Water Standard of 1962. It is
stated in Appendix A of the rule that “minimum protection should include
programs that result in...prevention of health hazards, such as cross-
connections.”
   (B)   The state is granted primacy over the water program and the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) is designated the implementing
agency for all purposes of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 USC 300f et seq.) by
the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (ILCS Chapter 415, Act 5).
   (C)   Pursuant to the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (ILCS Chapter
415, Act 5), the Pollution Control Board Rules (“Board”) and the Safe Drinking
Water Act (42 USC 300f et seq.), owners and official custodians of a public
water supply in the state shall provide continuous operation and maintenance of
public water supply facilities so that the water shall be assuredly safe in
quality, clean, adequate in quantity, and of satisfactory mineral
characteristics for ordinary domestic consumption.
   (D)   Title 35, Subtitle F, Chapter II, Subpart H, Section 651.102 of the
Illinois Administrative Code defines CROSS-CONNECTION as “any physical
connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of
which contains potable water and the other contains water of unknown or
questionable safety or steam, gases, or chemicals if there may be a flow from
one system to the other.” The definition includes any arrangement of piping
where a potable water line is connected to non-potable water. It may be a pipe-
to-pipe connection where potable and non-potable water lines are directly
connected or a pipe-to-water connection where the potable water outlet is
submerged in non- potable water. If the potable and non-potable sources are
separated by gate valves, check valves or devices other than the appropriate
backflow preventer as outlined in the regulation, a cross-connection exists.
Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, swivel or changeover assemblies, or
other temporary or permanent assemblies through which or because of which
backflow may occur are considered to be cross-connections.
   (E)   The public water system purveyor is required to adopt and enforce an
active cross-connection control program that contains the minimum components
specified in Title 35, Subtitle F, Chapter II, Subpart H, Section 653.801. As
required by the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the regulations of
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, this cross-connection control
ordinance and the cross-connection control policy manual have been officially
adopted by the President and Board of Trustees of the village to protect the
public potable water supply from potential contamination through cross-
connections.
(Ord. 04-10, passed 4-19-2004)
§ 52.03 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL POLICY MANUAL.
   (A)   The Village of East Dundee Cross-Connection Control Policy Manual is
hereby approved and adopted and contains all requirements, responsibilities,
and special water service connection maintenance fees associated with this
cross-connection control program.
   (B)   All persons and facilities receiving water from the village public
potable water system, all cross- connection control device inspectors, all
installers of backflow prevention assemblies or devices, and any others
involved or associated with cross-connection control and backflow prevention
within the jurisdiction of the village will adhere to and comply with the
latest approved version of the Village of East Dundee Cross-Connection Control
Policy Manual. Those failing to comply with the requirements established in the
aforesaid policy manual will be subject to the penalties and enforcement
actions established within the policy manual.

authorized by the Village Administrator.
   (B)   No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which interferes with or passes through
the POTW. The following general prohibitions shall apply to all users to the
village’s POTW whether or not a user is subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment
standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances
to the village’s POTW:
      (1)   Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are or may be sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious or hazardous in any other
way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW, including but not limited to
waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140°F or 60°C using the
test methods specifiedin 40 CFR 261.21. At no time shall two successive
readings on a meter capable of reading L.E.L. (lower explosive limit) at a
point at the nearest accessible point to the POTW in a sanitary sewer, at the
point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW be more than 5%
nor any single reading greater than 10%. The following materials may not be
added to the sewer in detectable quantities unless specifically permitted or
limited in the user’s wastewater discharge permit: gasoline, kerosene, naphtha,
benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides,
chlorates, prechlorates, bromates, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated
biphenyls, carbides, hydrides, Stoddard solvents, and sulfides. The permitting
of these items in no way relieves the user of prohibitions of discharges of
explosive hazardous or injurious substances.
      (2)   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow
in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment
facilities, such as but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater

quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, to constitute a hazard to
humans or animals, to create an incompatible effect in the receiving water of
the POTW, to exceed the limitations set forth in a national categorical
pretreatment standard (when effective) or in §§
53.020 et seq., or to create a public nuisance. An incompatible pollutant shall
include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307
(a) of the Act (33 USC 1317(a)).
      (5)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either
singly or by interaction with other wastewaters are sufficient to create a
public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into sewer
for their maintenance and repair.

to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or
regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act (33 USC 1345); any criteria
guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant
to the RCRA and SWDA (42 USC 6901 et seq.), the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et
seq.), the Toxic Substance Control Act (15 USC 2601 et seq.); or state criteria
applicable to the sludge management method being used.
      (7)   Any substance, which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit or the receiving water quality standards.
      (8)   Any wastewater having a temperature at the point of discharge to
the POTW which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant
resulting in interference; in no case shallwastewater be introduced to the POTW
which exceeds 65°C (157°F) or which exceeds 40°C (104°F) at the POTW treatment
plant.
      (9)   Any pollutant(s), including but not limited to petroleum oil,

such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by state or
federal regulations.
      (11)   Any pollutant(s) which result in the presence of toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems.
      (12)   Any wastewater containing BOD, total solids, or suspended solids
of such character and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to
handle such materials at the sewage treatment plant, provided, however, that a
user may be permitted by specific written agreement with the village, which
agreement to discharge such BOD or TSS may provide for special charges,
payments, or provisions for treating and testing equipment and such agreement
to be negotiated with the village prior to the discharge of any such
wastewater.
      (13)   Ammonia nitrogen in amounts that would cause a violation of the
water quality standards of the receiving waters of the POTW.

before construction of the facility. The user shall obtain all necessary
construction operating permits from the IEPA. Such pretreatment facilities
shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA certified wastewater
treatment operator. The review of such plans shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying its facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the village under the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Within a reasonable time after the completion of the wastewater
treatment facility, the user shall furnish its operations and maintenance
procedures for the village to review. Any subsequent, significant changes in
the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
accepted by the village prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
   (E)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Village Administrator may require users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

§ 53.026 PROHIBITION OF IMPROPER DILUTION.
   No user shall increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
national categorical pretreatment standards (NCPS) (when effective) or in any
other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the village or state. The
Village Administrator may impose mass limitations on users who may be using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in cases
when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

§ 53.028 SPILL CONTAINMENT AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Accidental discharges.
      (1)   Each industrial user having the ability to cause interference with
the POTW treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of this
chapter shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner of user’s own cost and expense.
      (2)   All industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include
compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause
interference with the POTW must, when required by the village, have detailed
plans on file at the village showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection. Plans shall be approved by the village and meet 40 CFR
Part 403, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan, conditions before
construction of the facility.
      (3)   No user shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system
until accidental discharge facilities and procedures, as appropriate, have been
approved by the village and installed by the industrial user. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Immediate notification. In the case of an accidental or deliberate
discharge of compatible or incompatible pollutants, which cause interference at
the POTW or violate regulatory requirements of this chapter, it shall be the
responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the
village of the incident. The notification shall include name of caller,
location and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration, volume, and
any corrective actions taken by the user.
   (C)   Written report. Within 15 days following such an accidental or
deliberate discharge the industrial user shall submit to the Village
Administrator a detailed written report, describing the cause of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
Follow- up reports may be required by the village as needed. Such report, or
reports, shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish
kills, or any other damage to person or property nor shall such report relieve
the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate
discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the village,
result in the revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.
   (D)   Interim measures. The industrial user shall control production or all
discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable
regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement includes the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (E)   Notice to employees. A notice in English and the language of common
use shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge of a
prohibitive material. Employers shall insure that all employees who are in a
position to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental discharge are
advised of the emergency notification procedures.

   (A)   Whenever required by the village, users of any property serviced by a
sanitary sewer carrying wastewater shall install separators as necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, sand, oil, or any other
matters that may violate the provisions of §
53.021.
   (B)   When required, all sanitary sewers of the user into which waste
products are discharged shall be directed to one or more such separators before
connecting with the public sanitary sewers. Such separators shall be installed
by the user and be accessible for maintenance purposes and, when feasible,
shall be located outside the building. It shall be the user's responsibility to
clean and maintain such separator or separators at a regular frequency so as to
ensure efficient operation. The construction of separators shall be in strict
accordance with applicable state and local plumbing codes.
   (C)   All new or altered installation serving institutions or commercial
establishments in which grease, fats, culinary oil, grease, or fats in the
above type establishments shall be directed to one or more separators (grease
traps) located outside the building and shall be accessible for maintenance
purposes. Use of other separators (grease traps) shall require proof of being
at least equal to what is prescribed above. See illustration in the Illinois
State Plumbing Code (77 Illinois Administrative Code 890).
   (D)   All new or altered restaurants that require separator (grease trap)
shall install a minimum 1,000 gallon unit. Sandwich bars and carry-out services
which only prepare cold sandwiches (not cooked foods) shall install a minimum
400 gallon unit.
   (E)   The Board of Trustees of the village may after reviewing pertinent
information allow the installation of a grease trap having a lesser volume than
400 gallons. The sizing of this grease trap shall be determined by the village.
   (F)   No person shall reintroduce into the sewer system of the village
materials which have been removed from the sewer system by catch basins, grease
traps, and other pretreatment devices. Physical, chemical, or biological agents
shall not be introduced into catch basins, grease traps or other pretreatment
devices for the purpose of re-suspending, dissolving, emulsifying, or rendering
soluble any pollutants or other materials removed from a waste stream by such
pretreatment devices and reintroducing these materials into the sewer system.

issues such a permit under the provisions of division (B) above. The Board may
deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit.
   (D)   Supplemental wastewater discharge permits are ancillary to the general
wastewater discharge permit of the permittee and, when issued, shall become
part of the permittee’s general wastewater discharge permit or supplemental
permits shall constitute grounds for revocation of the general wastewater
discharge permit as set forth herein and for any other enforcement actions
available to the village under village ordinances found elsewhere. Within 180
days after the effective date of a national categorical pretreatment standard,
or 180 days after a final administrative decision has been made upon a
categorical determination submission in accordance with 40 CFR 403.3(a)(4) of
the general pretreatment regulations, whichever is later, existing industrial
users subject to such national categorical pretreatment standards and currently
discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the village’s POTW shall obtain a
supplemental wastewater discharge permit. Industrial users required to obtain a
supplemental wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file with the
village an application in a form to be prescribed and furnished by the village
and accompanied by a fee to be determined by the Board. New sources, when
subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, shall apply for a
supplemental wastewater discharge permit at least 90 days prior to discharging
to the POTW. New sources are also required to include in this report
information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources can provide verifiable estimate
values for subdivisions (4) and (5) of this division (D). The village will
evaluate the data furnished by the industrial user and may require additional
information within 45 days of submission by the industrial user. After
evaluation and acceptance of the date furnished, the village may issue a
supplemental wastewater discharge permit prior to the compliance date for the
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. In support of the
supplemental permit application/baseline report, the industrial user shall
submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the following
information:
      (1)   Name and address of the facility, including the name of the
operator and owners.
      (2)   List of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
      (3)   Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and
standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such
user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating
points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
      (4)   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow in gallons per day to the POTW from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams; and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow user of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) of the General Pretreatment Regulations.
      (5)   The industrial user shall identify the national categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process and shall:
         (a)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the village or
pretreatment standards) of regulated pollutants in the village from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where
required by the village or pretreatment standards) shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations.
         (b)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used of pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The village may
waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that
demonstrates that flow- proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases,
samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques
or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
         (c)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section.
         (d)   Take the samples immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, in order to evaluate compliance with the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) of the General Pretreatment Regulations.
Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) of the General Pretreatment Regulations, this
adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted to the village.
         (e)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR
Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
Administrator.
         (f)   Submit only with village authorization a supplemental permit
application/baseline report which utilizes only historical data, so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
         (g)   Provide for each report the time, date, and place of sampling
methods of analysis and certification that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
      (6)   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation
and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the user
to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards and requirements; and
      (7)   If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the user will provide the shortest
schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard.
         (a)   Where the industrial user’s national categorical pretreatment
standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), or the
combined waste stream formula (40 CFR 4016(e)), or net-gross calculations (40
CFR 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a baseline report, the
information required in subdivisions (6) and (7) of this division (D) shall
pertain to the modified limits.
         (b)   If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the
industrial user is modified after the application for a supplemental wastewater
discharge permit is submitted, the user shall make any necessary amendments to
information provided as a response to subdivisions (6) and (7) of this division
(D) and submit them to the village within 60 days after the modified limit is
approved.
      (8)   The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted in
response to subdivision (7) of this subdivision (D):
         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (such as hiring an
engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contract for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, and the like).
         (b)   No increment referred to in subdivision (8)(a) of this division
(D) shall exceed nine months.
         (c)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
village including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the village.
      (9)   Such other information as may be reasonably requested by the POTW.
      (10)   The village will evaluate the data furnished by the industrial
user and may require additional information within 90 days of submission by the
industrial user. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the
village may issue a supplemental wastewater discharge permit.
   (E)   Permit modifications.
      (1)   General industrial wastewater discharge permits issued to an
industrial user will be supplemented by the incorporation of supplemental
wastewater discharge permits for a user, which has manufacturing processes
regulated by national categorical pretreatment standards. This modification
will include the limits on average and daily maximum pollutant concentrations
from the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard and serve to
include them into the general industrial wastewater discharge permit.
      (2)   Where the national categorical pretreatment limits are modified,
the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e) of the General Pretreatment
Regulations), or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13 of
the General Pretreatment Regulations), the limits as modified shall be made a
part of the supplemental wastewater discharge permit.
      (3)   Where an industrial user has manufacturing processes which are
regulated by more than one national categorical pretreatment standard at the
same permitted discharge location, the limitation in the supplemental
wastewater discharge permit shall be adjusted consistent with USEPA guidelines
and regulations.
   (F)   Permit conditions. Discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all
provisions of this chapter and all other applicable regulations, user charges,
and fees established by the village. General and supplemental permits may
contain the following:
      (1)   The wastewater discharge permit shall include the limits on daily
maximum and average pollutant concentrations from the applicable pretreatment
standard (which includes federal, state, and local limits) whichever is more
stringent.
      (2)   Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization for each separate discharge
of a user.
      (3)   Requirements for installation and operation of inspection,
sampling, and monitoring facilities.
      (4)   Specifications for monitoring programs, which may include sampling
locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards for tests, and
reporting schedule.

      (6)   Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge
reports.
      (7)   Requirements to retain for a minimum of three years any records of
monitoring activities and results relating to wastewater discharge and for
affording the village access to said records.
      (8)   Requirement for notification of the village of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment
system.
      (9)   Requirements of notification of slug discharges as contained in
this chapter.
      (10)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the village to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
      (11)   Requirements that permittee allow the POTW or its representatives
ready access upon presentation of credentials at reasonable times to all parts
of its premises in which a discharge source or treatment systems is located or
in which records required by this chapter are kept for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination, and photocopying of said records and for the
performance of any of their duties.
      (12)   Requirements that permittee provide such information to the POTW
as may reasonably be required from time to time.
   (G)   Change in condition. In the event the type, quality, or volume of
wastewater from the property for which a discharge permit was previously
granted is expected to materially and substantially change as determined by the
permittee or the village, the person previously granted such permit shall give
30 days notice in writing to the village and shall make a new application to
the village prior to said change, in the same manner and form as originally
made, provided that information previously submitted and unchanged need not be
resubmitted by permittee. No permittee shall materially and substantially
change the type, quality, or volume of its wastewater beyond that allowed by
its permit without prior approval of the village.
   (H)   Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to
exceed five years. The user shall apply, on a form provided by the village, for
reissuance of the permit. Upon reissuance, any applicable provisions of the
supplemental wastewater discharge permit issued during term of the expiring
general wastewater discharge permit shall be incorporated as conditions of the
new general water discharge permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may
be subject to modification by the Board during the term of the permit as
limitations or requirements as identified in §53.041 are modified or other just
cause exists. Where the national categorical pretreatment standards are
modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7) or fundamentally different
factor variance for non-toxics (40 CFR 403.13) of the General Pretreatment
Regulations, the limits as modified shall be made a part of the wastewater
discharge permit and shall be adjusted consistent with USEPA guidelines and
regulations. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his or her
permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Where any
changes are made in user’s permit, a reasonable time shall be given to achieve
compliance.
   (I)   Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user
for the process activity specified in the permit. A wastewater discharge permit
shall not be assigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner or new user in
different premises or to a new or changed operation in the same or different
premises without the approval of the village. If the premises are sold or
otherwise transferred by the permittee to a new owner who will maintain the
operation in the same premises, then the permit held by the seller shall be
reissued by the Board to the new owner as a temporary permit, provided that the
new owner shall immediately apply for a new permit in accordance with this
chapter and further provided that the temporary permit shall only be effective
for 90 days after the date of sale or transfer. The village shall have the same
remedies for violation of temporary permits as it has for violation of other
discharge permits.
   (J)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. The industrial user
shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous wastes authorities of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance, which is a listed or characteristic waste under Section 3001 of RCRA
(42 USC 6921). Such notification must include a description of any such wastes
discharged, specifying the volume and concentration of such wasters and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other), identifying the hazardous
constituents contained in the listed wastes, and estimating the volume of
hazardous wastes expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. This
requirement shall not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-
monitoring requirements of 40 CRF 403.12(b), (d), and (e). This provision does
not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwisepermitted to be
discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable
federal or state law.

§ 53.042 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of
a new source following the commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the village a report containing the information
described in §
53.041(D)(4) through (6). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the village in accordance with the
procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure
of the user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject
to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period.
   (B)   Continued compliance reports.
      (1)   Any user required by the national pretreatment standard of the
village, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the
case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit to the village a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent. The frequency of this report typically will be
semiannually, although more frequent reports may be required by the village of
the national pretreatment standard.
      (2)   At the discretion of the village, this report shall also include
concentrations of BOD/COD/TSS or other pollutants specified by the village.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Village Administrator and in consideration
of such factors as local high or low flow rate, holidays, or budget cycles, the
Village Administrator may agree to alter the months during which the above
reports are submitted.
      (4)   Where the village has imposed mass limitations on industrial users
as provided for by 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required by division (B)(1)
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long term production rate. For
all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production
(or other measure of operation), the report required by division (B)(1) shall
include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
   (C)   Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. All categorical
and non-categorical industrial discharges that could cause problems to the POTW
immediately of all including any slug loadings, as defined by 40 CFR Part 404,
by the industrial user.
   (D)   Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance.
      (1)   The reports required in divisions (A) and (B) of this section shall
contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the
flow, the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by
the village, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standards. At the village's discretion, this sampling
and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu of the industrial user.
Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the compliance
certification required under 40 CFR 403.12(b)(6) and 403.12(d). In addition,
where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report,
including flow data, the village may waive the requirement of the industrial
user to submit the report.
      (2)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the village within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to
the village within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except that
the industrial user is not required to resample if:
         (a)   The village performs sampling of the industrial user at a
frequency of at least once per month;or
         (b)   The village performs sampling of the user between the time when
the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
      (3)   The reports in division (B) of this section shall be based upon
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period. The village shall require that frequency
of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (4)   All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Administrator pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act (33 USC
1314(h)) and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any
other test procedures approved by the Administrator. (See 40 CFR Part 136.4 and
136.5). Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved
by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the
Administrator determines that Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutants in question or where the Administrator determines
that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated
analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties approved by the
Administrator.
      (5)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in
division (B) of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the village, using the procedures prescribed in division (D)(4) of
this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (E)   Reporting requirements for industrial users not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards. The village shall require appropriate reporting from
those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Notification of change discharge. All industrial users shall promptly
notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character
of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic
hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40
CFR 403.12(p).
   (G)   Signatory reports for industrial user reports. The reports required by
divisions (A) and (B) of this section shall include the certification statement
as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and shall be signed as follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by divisions (A) and (B) of this section is a
corporation. For the purpose of this division, a responsible corporate officer
means:
         (a)   A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function or any other person who
performs similar policy- or decision-making functions for the corporation; or
         (b)   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or
operation facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual
sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second-quarter 1980 dollars),

§ 53.044 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Each industrial user whose wastewater discharge(s) has by sampling of
wastewater or other means of inspection been found to contain or have the
potential to contain incompatible priority pollutants in amounts or
concentrations which may cause interference with the wastewater treatment works
process or operation shall provide and maintain at all times monitoring
facilities, including but not limited to a manhole, as required by the village
at each applicable building sewer discharge which will allow for inspections,
sampling, and flow measurement of the discharge to the village sewer line. Such
monitoring facility shall be provided and maintained by the user on each
building sewer discharge, which contains or has the potential to contain
incompatible priority pollutants; provided, however, that an industrial user,
subject to the provisions of the national categorical pretreatment standards
shall sample and/or monitor in accordance with such standards. The village
maintains the right to require installation of monitoring facilities on
existing lines for cause.
      (1)   The monitoring facilities shall be located on the industrial user’s
premises, provided that if such location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship to the industrial user, the village may allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area. Monitoring facilities
located in public streets or sidewalks shall not obstruct the flow of traffic.
Said facility shall be located so that samples may be taken safely and easily
and shall not be obstructed by landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activity
of the industrial user. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director of Public Works or
designated representative and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the user.
      (2)   All monitoring facilities must meet all local and village
construction codes and must be approved by the village prior to construction.
      (3)   There shall be ample room in and near such monitoring facilities to
allow accurate sampling and monitoring equipment to be installed and to prepare
samples for analysis. Such facilities shall be accessible to authorized
representatives of the village at all times upon representation of suitable
identification without delay from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., seven days per week,
provided that authorized representatives of the village personnel shall under
exceptional circumstances have access upon presentation of suitable
identification at all times, without limitation.
      (4) When requested by the village, the user shall make the entrance or
manhole to such monitoring facilities securable by a breakaway locking device.
The village shall provide complete control of access to the monitoring
facility. When required by an industrial user, village personnel shall be
available to open the monitoring facilities on 90 minute notice upon good cause
shown. Alternative means of adequately securing such monitoring facilities may
be approved by the Village Administrator upon recommendation of the Director of
Public Works. This determination shall be made when requested by the industrial
user.
      (5)   The village may require that monitoring facilities shall contain
the following equipment installed in a permanently fixed position by the
industrial user:
         (a)   Flow monitoring equipment approved by the village.
         (b)   A recording and totalizing register for measurement of the
liquid quantity; or at the discretion of the village the metered water supply
to the industrial user may be used as the liquid quantity where it is
substantiated to the Director of Public Works that the metered water supply and
waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment
agreed to by the village is made in the metered water supply to determine the
liquid waste quantity.
         (c)   A dedicated source of electrical power to the monitoring
facilities of sufficient voltage and amperage to operate all equipment in the
sampling chamber. An appropriate device shall be installed by user to indicate
a power failure and length of time of such failure. Such device shall be
specified by the village and furnished by user.
      (6)   Automatic composite sampling devices provided by the user will be
installed and operated in the monitoring facility on a 24-hour basis seven days
per week. Samples will be collected by village personnel five days per week and
analyzed on a routine basis. The village will provide a split of each sample
taken from said monitoring facility upon written request of the industrial
user.
      (7)   When required, time composite samples shall be taken at a frequency
determined by the village, and properly refrigerated and preserved in
accordance with Standard Methods and 40 CFR Part 136, and shall be composited
in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. Such sampling
shall be done as prescribed by the village.
      (8)   When a sampler has been required of a user, that user shall develop
and implement procedures that guarantee the sample collected shall be
representative of its daily effluent. The user shall inform the Director of
Public Works within one business day if a sample collected is not
representative of its daily flow.
      (9)   The frequency of sampling, sampling chamber, metering device,
sampling methods, and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any time, to
inspection and verification by the village.
   (B)   All measurements, tests, and analyses to which reference is made in
this chapter shall be determined and performed in accordance with the
procedures established by the Administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (hereafter “Administrator”) pursuant to Section 304(g) of the
Act (33 USC 1314(g)) and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or
with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator.
Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for
the pollutants in question, or where the Administrator determines that the Part
136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical
methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator.

§ 53.061 WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge
for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the
village shall consist of a user charge for the operation and maintenance plus
replacement, a debt service charge, a surcharge if applicable, and such other
charges as the village deems necessary.
   (B)   User charge levied on all users.
      (1)   The user charge is levied on all users to recover the operation,
maintenance plus replacement (O,M,&R) costs and shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic concentrations:
         (a)   A five-day, 20°C, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 300 mg/l.
         (b)   A suspended solids content of 300 mg/l.
      (2)   The user charge shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the annual wastewater volume, pounds of BOD, and pounds
of SS to be treated.
         (b)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all work categories.
         (c)   Proportion the estimated O,M,&R costs to each user class by
volume, BOD, and SS.
         (d)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal domestic strength.
         (e)   Compute surcharge costs per pound for BOD and SS concentrations
in excess of normal domestic strengths.
      (3)   The user charge is computed by dividing the number of units of flow
of wastewater from all sources into the annual revenue required less the
estimated surcharge payments to be received. The resultant charge is expressed
in dollars per thousand gallons of wastewater.
   (C)   Debt service charge. The debt service charge is levied on all users
and may be computed by apportioning the annual debt service by one of the
following methods:
      (1)   As a charge per 1,000 gallons.
      (2)   As a fixed charge per billing period.
      (3)   As a fixed charge plus a charge per 1,000 gallons.
   (D)   Capital improvement charge (connection fee). The capital improvement
charge is levied as a connection fee on users to provide for the capital
improvements, extensions, or reconstruction of the sewage treatment works. The
capital improvement charge is computed and assessed as a fixed charge per P.E.
estimated to be used by the user.
   (E)   Surcharge.
      (1)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the
normal domestic concentrations of BOD (300 mg/l) and SS (300 mg/l). The
surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters for all
wastes which exceed the 300 mg/l and 300 mg/l concentrations for BOD and SS
respectively and set by the Director of Public Works.
      (2)   The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be
established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as
may be deemed necessary by the Director of Public Works and shall be binding as
a basis for surcharges.
   (F)   Other charges. The village may declare a rate to provide funds for
such other costs as may be applicable to the wastewater facilities. Such rate,
if established, shall be applicable to all users.
   (G)   Adequacy of wastewater service charge. The adequacy of the wastewater
service charge shall be reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified
public accountants for the village in their annual audit report. The wastewater
service charge shall be reviewed periodically to reflect a change in local
O,M,&R costs.
   (H)   Notification of rates. The users of the wastewater treatment services
will be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and
that portion of the user charges, which are attributable to the wastewater
operation, maintenance, and replacement.
   (I)   Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be metered water consumption read to the lowest
even increments of 1,000 gallons.
      (1)   If the person discharging waste into the public sewers procure any
part, any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public
waterworks system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a
type approved by the Director of Public Works for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
      (2)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the Director of Public Works if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (3)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the Director of Public Works.

per P.E. for all other users of the wastewater facility.
   (D)   Minimum charge.
      (1)   A minimum charge may be established in the annual fee schedule and
shall be applied to all users whose consumption does not exceed a set gallonage
per billing period. This minimum charge shall be established in the annual fee
schedule.
      (2)   Usage in excess of the set gallonage per billing period will be
charged a fee as established in the annual fee schedule per 1,000 gallons.
      (3)   Where a connection services more than one dwelling unit on a
property either within the corporate limits or outside of the corporate limits,
the minimum charge shall be the number of dwelling units served by the service
times the minimum bill or the actual number of gallons used, multiplied by the
currently established sewer rate plus the other current charges, whichever is
greater.
   (E)   Non-metered users. All non-metered users of the wastewater facilities
shall pay a flat rate charge as established in the annual fee schedule. In the
event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by the Director of Public

Public Works may require flat rate users to install metering devices on the
water supply or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied.
   (F)   Surcharge rates. The rates of surcharges for BOD and SS shall be as
established by the Director of Public Works.
   (G)   Effective date of rates. The rates and service charges established for
user charges shall be effective on bills to be rendered for the next succeeding
billing period after approval and authorization of the Village Board. A copy of
said wastewater service charges shall be filed in the office of the Village
Clerk and shall be deemed notice to all owners of real estate of their
liability for service supplied to any user of the service of the wastewater
facilities of the village, on their properties.
   (H)   Appeals. The method for computation of rates and service charges
established for user charges shall be made available to a user within 14 days

are certified, until there is an acceptable payment history for a further one-
year period.
   (E)   Whenever a bill for utility service remains unpaid for three
consecutive billing cycles after it has been rendered it shall be deemed and is
hereby declared delinquent, as provided by law. The Director of Finance or his
or her designee may, in his or her discretion, send the unpaid invoices to a
collection agency, proceed with utility service termination, file with the
county recorder of deeds a statement of lien claim or proceed with any other
remedy available to the village under this code or state or federal law.
   (F)   Disconnection/termination of service.
      (1)   If the rates or charges for service or industrial cost recovery are
not paid for three consecutive billing cycles, the Director of Finance or his

§ 53.064 LIEN—NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   Lien—notice of delinquency.
      (1)   Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for three
consecutive billing cycles for the bi-monthly service after it has been
rendered, the Director of Finance or his or her designee may file with the
County Recorder of Deeds, a legal statement of lien claim. This statement shall
contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid
bill, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as
for all charges subsequent to the period covered by the bill.
      (2)   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises
and the village has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the
premises if his or her address be known to the village, whenever such bill
remains unpaid for three consecutive billing cycles for a bi-monthly bill after
it has been rendered.
      (3)   The failure of the Director of Finance or his or her designee to
record such lien or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive
such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bill as
mentioned in this section.
   (B)   Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges
shall be sold for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall
be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be bill-in equity in the
name of the village. The Village Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to
institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has
remained unpaid for a time period as specified in the ILCS Chapter 65, Act 5, §

ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES AND PENALTIES
§ 53.080 GENERAL.
   Should analysis by the village of the discharge of any user show that such
discharge exceeds standards specified in §§53.021 through 53.023 or any
condition of a user's general or supplemental wastewater discharge permit, the
village may, at its option, institute voluntary compliance proceedings as
outlined in §53.081, or take such other actions as are authorized by this
chapter, statutes, regulations at law or in equity. Additionally, should the
village at its option, elect to begin voluntary compliance proceedings as
outlined in §53.081 and then determine that such proceedings are ineffective or
futile or are likely to be ineffective or futile if continued, it may terminate
said voluntary compliance proceedings at such point and, at the option of the
Board of Trustees, require the user to attend a standards meeting as outlined
in §53.082(B), or proceed with any other remedies authorized by this chapter,
statutes, regulations, at law or in equity.
(Ord. 03-19, passed 10-20-2003)
§ 53.081 VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Voluntary user program—user initiated. Should a user present to the
village, at any time prior to being required to do so by the village,
information, data, plans, schedules, and the like relating to a proposed
procedure for the prevention of discharges in violation of the provisions of
this chapter, the village may receive such material and initiate procedures for
the preparation of a compliance directive relating to that user without the
need for review and standards meetings. Neither the presentation of material to
the village nor the acceptance of such material by the village nor the
commencement of procedures for the issuance of a compliance directive shall
prevent the village from issuing any notice of violation nor does it exempt any
user from the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Voluntary program—village initiated.
      (1)   The following voluntary proceedings between the village and a user
whose wastewater has been shown to violate the user's wastewater discharge
permit or any provisions of §§53.021 through 53.023 may be followed by the
village in an effort to assist the user and to ensure compliance with this
chapter short of court action. The proceedings outlined in this section are
voluntary and are not to be construed as conditions precedent for the village
using any of the remedies set forth in this chapter, or by law.
      (2)   Should analysis by the village indicate that the limitations or
discharge have been exceeded in the discharge of a user, a violation is
presumed to have occurred. The village shall notify the user, in writing,
(which writing is hereinafter called “Notice of Review”) as to the particulars
of such presumed violation and set a time and place for a meeting (hereinafter
called a “Review Meeting”) to be attended by representatives of the village and
the user. The purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss and establish means
of preventing violations of any of the limitation on discharge.
(Ord. 03-19, passed 10-20-2003)
§ 53.082 COMPULSORY COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   When the village finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the village may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of receipt
of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the village.
      (2)   Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the village to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Standards meeting. Should a violation by a user occur following the
issuance of a notice of violation or after a review meeting with that user, the
village shall notify the offending user, in writing, through a “notice of
standards meeting” as to the particulars of such violation or violations and
set a time and place for a meeting (hereinafter called a “standards meeting”)
to be attended by representatives of the village and the user. The village may,
upon determination that a violation has occurred, send the user notice of
standards meeting without first having a review meeting or follow any
procedures under §
53.081 hereof. The purpose of such a meeting shall be to establish such
procedure, investigations, and studies as the village deems necessary and
desirable for the determination of such action as it may require of the user to
control and prevent discharges in violation of the limitations on discharge.
   (C)   Compliance directive. Following the completion of the investigation
and studies described in division (A) above, the village may direct and require
the user to take such action as may be required to control and prevent
discharges in violation of the limitations on discharge, including pretreatment
of those wastewaters which contain or may contain pollutants subject to
limitations on discharge. If the village has sufficient information at the time
of the standards meeting to determine necessary action, it may, at the time of
the standards meeting, direct and require the user to take such action,
including pretreatment, without further investigation or study, and the user
shall comply. The user shall cooperate fully with the village in making such
investigations and studies as may be required. Following a directive in
writing, hereinafter called “compliance directive,” by the village to require
the user to take necessary action, the user shall within 90 days, submit to the
village for review, a schedule for compliance and preliminary information
regarding any pretreatment facilities to be provided. Such preliminary
information shall include, without limitation, the nature and type of
facilities and equipment proposed, their general location and the degree of
treatment anticipated. The village shall review and discuss the schedule and
preliminary information with the user. Final acceptance by the village,
following discussions with the user, shall be within 30 days of the submittal
of an acceptable schedule and plans to the village. Such approval does not
release the user from responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, either before or after any pretreatment facilities are operational,
nor does such approval constitute a liability of the village should be
facilities fail to produce an acceptable pollutant concentration. The user
shall keep the village informed as to the progress of work to provide required
pretreatment. Failure to comply with a compliance directive of the village
regarding pretreatment facilities or failure to comply with the schedule, as
approved, shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of this chapter and may
be grounds for revocation of the user’s wastewater discharge permit.
   (D)   Variance; procedures. Any user issued a compliance directive under the
provisions of this section relevant to §
53.022 shall apply for a variance at least five days prior to the next Board
meeting, and petition the Board for a variance or variances in accordance with
§
53.084. Failure to apply shall be a violation of the chapter and subject the
user to the penalties provided in §§ 53.075 et seq. Except as provided in §
53.084, no variance granted pursuant to the terms of this chapter may allow
discharge greater than 2.5 times the limitation on discharge for specific
pollutants or shall last longer than the term of a compliance directive issued
in accordance with division (C) above.
(Ord. 03-19, passed 10-20-2003)
§ 53.083 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Responsibility of the Board of Trustees. The Board shall have
responsibility for reviewing all requests for revocation of wastewater
discharge permits, disconnection of users from the village POTW, revocation of
variance granted under provisions of this chapter and appeals under the
procedures established in §
53.065. Only the Board shall have the authority to approve such revocation of
permits, variances, and disconnection of building sanitary sewers, and only the
Board shall be empowered to take final action on appeals.
   (B)   Conditions for revocatition. Any user who violates this chapter, or
applicable state and federal statutes and regulations, or the following, is
subject to having its permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this
section.
      (1)   Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge as determined by the use’s or the
village’s analysis.
      (2)   Failure of the user to provide prior notification of significant
changes in process activity or wastewater constituents and characteristics.
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises by village
representatives for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.
      (4)   Tampering with, disrupting, or destroying village equipment as
determined by the Board, by a preponderance of evidence, which determination
shall be final.
      (5)   Failure to report an accidental discharge of a pollutant in a
reportable quantity.
      (6)   Failure to report an upset of user’s treatment facilities.
      (7)   Violations of conditions of the permit.
      (8)   Discharges which present or may present an endangerment to the
environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW.
      (9)   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge

      (12)   Failure to meet effluent limitations or compliance schedules.
      (13)   Failure to pay fines or sewer use charges. Wastewater discharge
permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business
ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are
void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The General Manager may order any user who causes or allows an
unauthorized discharge to show cause before the Board why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place of hearing to be held by the Board regarding the
violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the Board why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, at least five days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The Board shall develop rules of procedure and evidence for the
conduct of such hearings. The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence or may designate any of its members or any member of its legal staff
to:
         (a)   Issue, in the name of the Board, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearing.
         (b)   Take the evidence.
         (c)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Board for
action thereon.
      (3)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken must
be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will
be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon
payment of the usual charges therefor.
      (4)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing either:
         (a)   That the wastewater discharge permit be revoked and the service
be disconnected; or
         (b)   That following a specified time, the permit shall be revoked and
sewer service disconnected or discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and
operate properly to comply with the wastewater discharge permit; or
         (c)   That the permit be revoked and the user directed to cease the
unauthorized discharge effective after a specified period of time; or
         (d)   That such other relief as deemed necessary, including but not
limited to disconnection of service and levy of fines, as deemed necessary by
the Board to abate the discharge be granted. Further orders and directives as
necessary may be issued.
      (5)   Following an order or revocation, the user shall cease to discharge
wastewater, other than sanitary wastewater, to the village POTW. Failure to do
so shall be evidence of continuing harm to the village and provide grounds for
an order of disconnection or for the granting of injunctive relief or temporary
restraining orders.

§ 53.084 VARIANCE.
   (A)   To the extent consistent with the applicable provisions of the Act and
the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (ILCS Chapter 415 , Act 5, §§ 1 et
seq., as amended from time to time), the Board may grant individual variances
beyond the limitations prescribed in §
53.022. The maximum variances on limitation on discharge (hereinafter “maximum
variance”) shall be 2.5 times the limitation on dischargefor specific
pollutants, provided, however, that the Board may, upon a showing by a
petitioner, that said maximum variance would be insufficient.
   (B)   In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions,
exceptions, time limitations, duration, and other limitations as the policies
of this chapter, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, and the Act may
require. Except as provided by this section, any variance granted by the Board

affirmative action of the Board for up to a maximum of five years but only if
satisfactory progress has been shown.
   (C)   Any person seeking a variance shall do so by filing a petition for
variance with the General Manager on forms provided by the village. The village
shall specify information required to be submitted by the petitioner. The
General Manager shall investigate such petition, consider the views of persons
who might be adversely affected by the granting of a variance, and make a
report to the Board of the disposition of the petition. If the Board, in its
discretion, concludes that a hearing would be advisable or if the General
Manager or any other person files a written objection to the granting of such
variance within 15 days, then a hearing shall be held under the provisions of
§53.083(C) and the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner.
(Ord. 03-19, passed 10-20-2003)
§ 53.085 UPSETS.
   (A)   Compliance requirements. An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the user can demonstrate that it has been in consistent compliance

§ 54.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case
of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications
retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
54.04 the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.
   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided
the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
(Ord. 07-55, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 54.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 07-55, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 54.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
54.21. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Ord. 07-55, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 54.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
divisions (A)(1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (5)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.  
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt
by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested,
of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to
cancel or not to renew."
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of
this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer"
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.

§ 54.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 07-55, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 54.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Provide a location convenient to the village and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 07-55, passed 12-17-2007)

for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such removal to
the village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this division.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of
this section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply.  
      (1)   If the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of division
(C) of this section, the village or its designee may, at the option of the
village:
         (a)   Correct the deficiencies;
         (b)   Upon not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
         (c)   After not less than 30 days notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the village.
      (2)   The permittee shall be liable in all events to the village for all
costs of removal.

§ 54.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the village no less
than 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-
of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or
the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village's right-
of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

§ 54.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Director of Public Works determines that
the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and

appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   90 degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or
as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.

maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;

         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.

misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement,

with the penalty provisions of this Village Code. There may be times when the
village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because
the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

   (B)   Precast concrete manholes shall be provided for this improvement
conforming to the applicable portions of Division III, Section 32 of the State
Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction and village
standards. The manhole bottom shall be precast with the first riser section. A
flexible type joint shall be furnished at points of entry into and exit from
manhole structures of design approved by the Village Engineer prior to
installation. This flexible joint may consist of a sleeve of high quality
synthetic rubber with a substantial serrated flange which is cast directly into
the wall of the manhole base to form a tight waterstop and protrudes outside of
the manhole wall to connect with the pipe entering/exiting the manhole. When
this type of flexible joint is used, the sleeve shall slip over the end of the
pipe adjacent to the manhole base and shall be secured by means of a stainless
steel strap clamp equipped with a draw bolt and nut. The contractor may elect
to utilize a modular mechanical type joint consisting of interlocking synthetic
rubber links shaped to continuously fill the annular space between the pipe and
wall opening. The links shall be loosely assembled with bolts to form a
continuous rubber belt around the pipe with a pressure plate under each bolt
head and nut. After the seal assembly is positioned in the sleeve, tightening
of the bolts shall cause the rubber sealing elements to expand and provide an
absolutely watertight seal between the pipe and manhole wall opening.
   (C)   Connections to existing manholes. A machine cored opening in the wall
of existing manholes shall be provided to accommodate a flexible connector
system. The system should consist of three component positive seal gasketing
system similar in design to Press-Seal Gasket Corporation of Fort Wayne,
Indiana (46852) PSX: SERIES SIX, POSITIVE SEAL. This connection system will
enable the contractor to provide a flexible, water-tight connection to existing
manholes. The three components should include a power sleeve, a gasket, and a
take-up clamp. The sleeve is to be mechanically expanded to compress the gasket
against the cored receptacle hole surface in the manhole wall. After adequate
compression of the gasket is achieved, the ends of the power sleeve should
interlock to insure against any loss of compression. The gasket system should
be secure in the manhole ready to accept pipe of the class and diameter
specified.
   (D)   Manhole appurtenances. The following items shall apply to all manhole
structures:
      (1)   Manholes shall be furnished with a water-tight frame and solid

with the word "SANITARY" imprinted on the cover in raised letters.
      (2)   Both the manhole frame and cover shall have machined horizontal and
vertical bearing surfaces.
      (3)   Pick holes shall not create openings in the manhole cover.
      (4)   Manholes located in areas subject to inundation shall be furnished
with waterproof, bolt-down frames and covers (Neenah Foundry R-1916-F, East
Jordan Iron Works 1045 ZPT or approved equal) with the word "SANITARY"
imprinted on the cover in raised letters.
      (5)   Manhole frames shall be adjusted to proper grade utilizing
reinforced, pre-cast concrete rings; brick or concrete blocks will not be
allowed.
      (6)   Adjusting rings shall be securely sealed to the cone section or top
barrel section of the manhole using an approved resilient, flexible, non-
hardening, pre-formed bituminous mastic material. This mastic shall be applied
in such a manner that no surface water or ground water inflow can enter the
manhole through gaps between the top barrel section or cone section and the
first adjusting ring, between adjusting ring, or between the last adjusting
ring and the manhole frame. Up to six inches of adjusting rings may be
installed on a given manhole.
      (7)   An exterior joint collar meeting A.S.T.M. C877-91 shall be used to
provide a water-tight seal between manhole barrel sections, cone barrel
section, and the cone section to frame and cover. The joint collar shall be
joint sealer system as manufactured by Mar-Mac Manufacturing Company of McBee,
South Carolina 29101 or an approved equal and shall be installed according to
the manufacturer's recommendations. The collar shall consist of a band seven
inches wide. The band shall have an outer layer of polyethylene with an under
layer of rubberized mastic that is reinforced with a woven polypropylene
fabric. There shall be a peelable protective paper against the mastic that is
removed when the collar is applied to the joint. Within the collar two steel
straps five-eighths inch wide shall be located three-quarter inches from each
edge of the band. The straps shall be in tubes that isolate them from the
mastic and allow them to slip freely when tightened around the pipe. The collar
shall be designed so that when it is applied around the joint, the ends shall
overlap at least six inches and when the straps are secured a layer shall
completely cover the straps protecting them from moisture and rust. A bell hole
shall be dug under the joint. After removing the protective paper, the band
shall be placed around the pipe, mastic side to the pipe and spanning the
joint, with the overlap at the top of the pipe. The steel straps shall be
secured with the proper tools. The closing flap shall cover all remaining
exposed strap.
      (8)   Hydraulic cement shall be used on all manhole interior joints
(dress up).
      (9)   Manhole steps on maximum 16 inch centers shall be furnished with
each manhole, securely anchored in place true to vertical alignment, in
accordance with the East Dundee Standard.
   (E)   Drop manhole assemblies. Drop manhole assemblies shall be provided at
the junction of sanitary sewers where the difference of grade of the inverts of
the pipes exceeds two feet. The entire drop assembly shall be cast in concrete
monolithically with the manhole barrel section for proposed manhole
construction or constructed of ductile iron pipe strapped to the outside of
existing manholes, if village permits, or of concrete encased drop assembly
tied to the exterior wall of existing manholes by a method approved by the
village.

§ 57.036 TESTING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF SANITARY SEWERS.
   All sanitary sewers 21 inches and smaller including service lines shall pass
a low pressure air test before acceptance. The village may, at their
discretion, require in addition to or in lieu of the low pressure air test an
exfiltration test as described in division (B) of this section which follows
prior to final acceptance. Sanitary sewers 24 inches and larger shall pass an
exfiltration test described in division (B) of this section and be subject to a
physical inspection by the village. Additionally, manholes are subject to
physical inspection and vacuum testing described in division (D) of this
section.
   (A)   Low pressure air test procedures and requirements. The procedure for
low pressure air testing shall follow that set forth in Section 31, Paragraph
31-1.11B(3) of the State Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer
Construction. All plugs including those in the upstream end of sanitary
services must be carefully braced to prevent leakage and blowout. The line
being tested shall be deemed acceptable when the time taken for the one pound
pressure drop is not less than that shown in the Air Test Table which follows
at the end of §
57.037.
   (B)   Exfiltration test procedures and requirements.  
      (1)   The exfiltration test shall be performed in the absence of ground

pipe diameter per mile per day, including all manholes and service lines. The
Village Engineer shall be the sole judge of the results.
   (C)   Deflection testing of PVC pipe. All main sewers shall be tested for
excess deflection by pulling a "go-no go" mandrel through the pipe from manhole
to manhole. The outside diameter of the test mandrel shall be equal to 95% of
the original inside diameter of the pipe being used. The main sewers shall be
so tested no sooner than 30 days after they have been installed. Wherever
possible and practical, the testing shall initiate at the downstream lines and
proceed towards the upstream lines. Where deflection is found to be in excess
of 5% of the original pipe diameter, the contractor shall excavate to the point
of excess deflection and carefully compact around the point where excess
deflection was found. The line shall then be retested for deflection. However,
should, after the initial testing, the deflected pipe fail to return to the
original size (inside diameter), the line shall be replaced.
   (D)   Vacuum testing manholes. All new manholes shall be subject to a vacuum
test. The test is applicable for new manholes. The vacuum test shall be
performed after backfilling is completed. The testing agency is to comply with
the following guidelines:
      (1)   Use manufactured vacuum test equipment meeting the Engineer's
approval and should follow equipment manufacturer's recommended procedures
throughout the test, unless directed otherwise required by this specification.
      (2)   Use extreme care and follow safety precautions during testing
operations. Keep personnel clear of manholes during testing.
      (3)   Seal all openings except manhole top access using pneumatic plugs
rated for test pressures. Install plugs according to test equipment
manufacturer's recommendations.
      (4)   Brace pipe inverts if connecting pipes have not been backfilled.
      (5)   Install vacuum tester head assembly on manhole top access, and
Inflate seal.
      (6)   Evacuate manhole to ten inches Hg (mercury) or five psi, close
isolation valve and start test. The start time of the test should be recorded.
      (7)   Maintain vacuum in manhole for the time indicated in table for the
diameter and depth of manhole being tested.
      (8)   Allowable vacuum loss: one inch Hg.
      (9)   Test failure is indicated by vacuum loss greater than allowable
within the minimum test time indicated in table for the size of manhole being
tested.

§ 57.062 PROTECTION OF WATER MAINS.
   (A)   General. Wherever pipelines designated to carry potable water supplies
cross or are laid less than ten feet horizontally from existing or proposed
drains or sewer lines, or cross house service sewers, storm drains, or sanitary
sewers, special precautions shall be taken as follows.
   (B)   Parallel water mains and sewers.
      (1)   Should conditions prevail which prevent a lateral separation of ten
feet, the pipeline may be laid closer than ten feet to a storm or sanitary
sewer, provided the water main is laid in a separate trench and at such an
elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least 18 inches of clear
separation above the crown of the sewer.
      (2)   If it is impossible to obtain a horizontal separation of at least
ten feet, and a vertical separation of at least 18 inches as stipulated above,
the sewer shall be constructed or reconstructed of mechanical or slip-on joint
ductile iron pipe, of PVC pipe equivalent to water main standards of
construction, or of concrete pressure pipes specified herein, and be pressure
tested to assure water tightness.
   (C)   Water main crossing sewers.
      (1)   Whenever the water main crosses over house sewers, storm drains or
sanitary sewers, the water main shall be laid at such an elevation that the
bottom of the water main is at least 18 inches above the top of the drain or
sewer. This minimum vertical separation shall be maintained for that portion of
the water main located within ten feet to be measured from the centerline of
the drain or sewer normal to the water main centerline.
      (2)   Under conditions that the minimum vertical separation set forth in
division (C)(1) above cannot be maintained or it is necessary for the water
main to pass under a sewer or drain, the water main shall be protected as
specified on Standard Drawings No. 21, 22, 23, and 24 of the State Standard
Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction.
      (3)   Where a water main must cross under a sewer or drain, in addition
to the above, a vertical separation of 18 inches between the sewer and water
main shall be maintained. The sewer shall be supported to prevent its settling
as directed by the Village Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works.
   (D)   Polyethylene encasement. Where, in the opinion of the Village Engineer
the conditions warrant, a study shall be made at the expense of the owner to
determine if polyethylene encasement of the ductile iron water main is
advisable. The encasement shall meet the requirements of ANSI A21.5 and AWWA
C104 standards.

in the special provisions, all pipe shall be laid to a minimum depth of five
feet six inches measured from the existing ground surface or established finish
grade to the top of the barrel of the pipe. In areas subject to subsequent
excavation or fill, the mains shall be laid to grades shown on the plans.
   (D)   Pipe foundations. To ensure that adequate and uniform support is
provided under the water main and to avoid differential settlement of the pipe,
all water main shall be laid on a bed of sand, gravel, or crushed stone to a
depth of four inches minimum thickness according to Laying Condition Type 4 set
forth in ANSI A21.50 and AWWA C150 standards. The initial backfilling of the
main to a minimum of six inches over the pipe shall be with approved fine
material free of rocks or clods larger than two inches in diameter. This
backfill material should be free of cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or
organic material, boulders or other material not suitable as determined by the
Village Engineer. The backfill shall be tamped into place to provide a firm
support all along the pipe.
   (E)   Dewatering of trench. Where water is encountered in the trench, it
shall be removed during pipe laying and jointing operations. Provisions shall
be made to prevent floating of the pipe. Trench water shall not be allowed to
enter the pipe at any time.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.064 HANDLING OF PIPE.
   (A)   All types of pipe shall be handled in such a manner as will prevent

§ 57.066 PRESSURE TESTING AND FLUSHING OF WATER MAINS.
   (A)   Hydrostatic test.
      (1)   The newly laid water mains or any valve sections of it shall be
subject to a hydrostatic pressure test of no less than 150 pounds per square
inch (PSI).
      (2)   Duration of each pressure test shall be for a period of not less
than two hours for pipes with uncovered joints and not less than six hours for
pipes which have been backfilled before tests are made.
   (B)   Procedure for test. Each valved section of pipe shall be slowly filled
with water and the specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a pump
connected to the pipe in a satisfactory manner. The pump pipe connection and
all necessary apparatus, including gauges and meters, shall be furnished by the
contractor. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be
expelled from the pipe. To accomplish this, taps shall be made, if necessary at
points of highest elevation, and afterwards tightly plugged. All exposed pipes,
fittings, valves, hydrants, and joints shall be carefully examined during the
open trench test. All joints showing visible leaks shall be repaired until
tight. Any cracked or defective pipes, fittings, valves, or hydrants discovered
as a consequence of this pressure test shall be removed and replaced by the
contractor with sound material, and the test shall be repeated until
satisfactory to the Village Engineer.
   (C)   Permissible leakage.
      (1)   Suitable means shall be provided by the contractor for determining
the quantity of water lost by leakage. The leakage test shall be conducted

      (3)   Leakage is defined as the quantity of water to be supplied in the
newly laid pipe and any valved section of it necessary to maintain the
specified leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and
the air expelled. The test pressure shall be maintained on the hourly basis
minimally or at intervals directed by the Engineer.
      (4)   Flanged pipe shall be "bottle tight".
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.067 FLUSHING.
   (A)   Sections of pipe to be disinfected shall first be flushed to remove
any solids or contaminated material that may have become lodged in the pipe. A
hydrant shall be installed at the end of the main. One two-and-one-half inch
hydrant opening will, under normal pressure, provide this velocity in pipe
sizes up to and including 12 inches.
   (B)   All taps required by the contractor for chlorination or flushing
purposes, or for temporary or permanent release of air, shall be provided by
him or her as a part of the construction of water mains.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.068 REQUIREMENT OF CHLORINE.
   Before being placed into service, all new mains and repaired portions of or
extensions to existing mains shall be chlorinated so that a chlorine residual
of not less than 25 parts per million remains in the water after standing 24
hours in the pipe.
   (A)   Form of applied chlorine. Chlorine shall be applied by one of the
methods which follow, subject to approval by the Village Engineer.
      (1)   Liquid chlorine. A chlorine gas-water mixture shall be applied by
means of a solution-feed chlorinating device or the dry gas may be fed directly
through proper devices for regulating the rate of flow and providing effective
diffusion of the gas into the water within the pipe being treated. Chlorinating
devices for feeding solutions of the chlorine gas or the gas itself must
provide means for preventing the backflow of water into the chlorine.
      (2)   Chlorine-bearing compounds in water. In certain instances, when the
usage of chlorine gas is not practical, such as in congested or confined areas,
upon approval of the Village Engineer, a chlorine-bearing compound of known
chlorine content, prepared in solution form, may be substituted for chlorine
gas.
   (B)   Point and rate of application.
      (1)   Point of application. The preferred point of application of the
chlorinating agent is at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved
section of it, and through a corporation stop inserted in the pipe. The water
injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe should be
supplied from a tap made on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the
flow into the pipeline extension. Alternate points of application may be used
when approved or directed by the Village Engineer.
      (2)   Rate of application. Water from the existing distribution system or
other approved source of supply shall be controlled to flow very slowly into
the newly laid pipeline during application of the chlorine. The rate of
chlorine mixture flow shall be in such proportion to the rate of water entering
the newly laid pipe that the dosage applied to the water will be at least 50
parts per million unless otherwise directed by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   Retention period. Treated water shall be retained in the pipe at
least 24 hours. After this period, the chlorine residual at pipe extremities
and at other representative points shall be at least 25 parts per million.
      (4)   Chlorinating valves and hydrants. In the process of chlorinating
newly laid pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the
pipeline is filled with the chlorinating agent and under normal operating
pressure.
      (5)   Preventing reverse flow. Valves shall be manipulated so that the
strong chlorine solution in the line being treated will not flow back into the
line supplying the water. Check valves may be used if desired.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.069 FINAL FLUSHING AND TESTING.
   (A)   Following chlorination, all treated water shall be thoroughly flushed
from the newly laid pipe at its extremity until the replacement water
throughout its length shows, upon test, the absence of chlorine. In the event
chlorine is normally used in the source of supply, then the tests shall show a
residual not in excess of that carried in the system.
   (B)   After flushing, water samples collected on two successive days from
the treated piping system, and directed by the Village Engineer, shall show
satisfactory bacteriological results. Bacteriological analysis must be
performed by a laboratory approved by the Director of the Illinois Department
of Public Health and the Village Engineer.
   (C)   Should the initial treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacterial
test, the original chlorination procedure shall be repeated by the contractor
until satisfactory results are obtained.

Medium-sized trees are better suited for planting on normal village parkways
than their larger counterparts. Large trees require more living space, and for
this reason it is recommended that they be planted on the private side of the
sidewalk whenever possible. The overall objective of proper tree selection is
to select the right tree for the right location in order that one may benefit
from the tree without being subject to future maintenance liabilities or
hazards.

Small trees are appropriate in parkway locations where due to space limitations
larger trees cannot be properly utilized without creating spacing conflicts
with existing trees. Height limitations imposed by overhead utilities also
necessitate the use of appropriate small trees in order to avoid line conflicts
and the necessity of excessive utility trimming that results in disfigured
trees. On the whole, small trees which tend to be more ornamental than their
larger counterparts can create an added aesthetic dimension to the streetscape.
*Selected cultivars or varieties of suitable form and resistant to scab disease
(see Appendix A for listing of recommended crabs for local use).
Table II
The following is a listing of trees more or less common to our area that are
not suitable as street or parkway trees. Their lack of suitability is based
upon undesirable growth habits, fruiting habits, form, susceptibility to
serious diseases, propensity to storm damage, and a host of other limitations
too numerous to mention. The limitations listed for each tree or species group
are not all-inclusive and mention only the more serious problems encountered
locally. In essence, there are far too many superior street or parkway trees
listed in Table I to warrant the use of any of the trees listed in Table II
except under special circumstances.
Though many of the trees listed in Table II are presently growing on our
parkways as a result of previously unrestricted plantings, they do constitute a
maintenance liability to the village and as such should be replaced on removal
with species listed in Table I.

      (2)   Where certain planting sites have been assigned a particular
species or variety, only the designated species or variety shall be planted on
such sites, unless the plan is reviewed by the Village Forester with the advice
and assistance of the Tree Committee.
      (3)   The Tree Committee, in conjunction with the Village Forester, shall
review, al least once every two years, the species, cultivars and varieties
listed on Table I to determine whether any should be removed or whether certain
new species, cultivars or varieties of proven adaptability and value should be
added; and the Tree Committee shall similarly review the trees listed in Table
II to determine whether any should be removed or whether certain new species,
cultivars or varieties should be added thereto.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.123 PLANTING STOCK REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Size.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified by the Village Forester, all medium to
large deciduous trees and their cultivars or varieties shall conform to the
American Association of Nurserymen Standards, shall be free of branches to a
point not more nor less than 60% of their height, be at least 1-1/4 to 1-1/
2 inches in diameter at a point six inches above ground level, and be at least
eight to ten feet in height when planted.
      (2)   All small deciduous trees and their cultivars or varieties shall be
at least five feet in height and have at least six branches on the upper half
of the trunk.
   (B)   Grade. Unless otherwise allowed for specific reasons, all trees shall
have comparatively straight trunks, well-developed leaders and tops, and the
roots shall not only be characteristic of the species, cultivar or variety, but
also shall exhibit evidence of proper nursery pruning practices. They shall
have acceptable balance between top and root. At the time of planting, all
trees must be free of mechanical injuries and other objectionable features that
tend to affect the future form and beauty of the plant.
   (C)   Location and spacing.
      (1)   Based on a 40 year cycle, no tree which will attain a trunk
diameter greater than 15 inches shall be planted in a treelawn less than five
feet in width. In treelawns less than five feet in width, or where overhead
lines or building setback presents a special problem, the selection of planting
site and species shall be determined by the Village Forester.
      (2)   Trees shall be planted at least 15 feet from driveways and alleys,
and at street intersections the planting shall not interfere with the required
sight distance determined by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   No tree shall be planted closer than ten feet to a utility pole to
allow room for line maintenance.
      (4)   Spacing of trees shall be determined by the Village Forester in
accordance with local conditions; the species, cultivars and varieties used;
and their mature height, spread and form. Generally, all large trees, at
maturity, shall be spaced 40 to 60 feet, center-to-center; all medium-sized
trees shall be spaced a minimum of 35 feet, center-to-center; and all small
trees shall be spaced a minimum of 25 feet, center-to-center.
      (5)   All planting on unpaved streets without curbs or sidewalks must
have approval of the Village Forester, who shall determine the location of the
tree so that it will not be injured or destroyed when the street is curbed and
paved or when sidewalks are constructed.
   (D)   Methods of planting and support.
      (1)   Most small deciduous trees and shrubs may be moved bare-rooted
unless otherwise indicated. Roots of bare-rooted trees and shrubs must be
protected against drying out.
      (2)   All coniferous trees shall be moved balled and burlaped. Balled
roots should be prevented from drying out at the surface of the ball, and they
should be protected against freezing.
      (3)   Pits for the planting of bare-rooted plants shall be at least 12
inches larger in diameter than the diameter of the root system in order to
accommodate the roots without crowding. For balled trees, the pits should be a
minimum of 12 inches larger than the diameter of the ball of soil to allow
proper backfill.
      (4)   Plants shall be planted no deeper than previously grown with due
allowance for settling.
      (5)   In poorly drained soil, artificial drainage shall be provided to
the root system of any species intolerant of wet sites, or a species tolerant
of wet sites shall be used.
      (6)   Top soil, compost, peat moss, or an acceptable soil mixture shall
be placed about the roots of bare-root stock or in the backfill around balled
stock. When the planting is completed, the entire root area shall be thoroughly
saturated with water and burlap wrappings shall be cut.
      (7)   Although pruning should be done to develop a balance with the root
system, excessive pruning at the time of transplanting should be avoided.
      (8)   Tree trunks shall be suitably wrapped and guyed, or supported in an
upright position, according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or
supports shall be installed so that they will neither girdle or cause serious
injury to the tree nor endanger public safety.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.124 EARLY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Newly planted trees, shrubs and other plants require special
maintenance for one or two growing seasons following planting. All maintenance
practices shall follow approved arboricultural standards.
   (B)   Watering. Ample soil moisture shall be maintained following planting.
A thorough watering once in five to ten days, depending on soil type and
drainage provisions, is usually adequate during the growing season. A soil
auger can be used to check the adequacy of moisture in the soil ball and/or
backfill.
   (C)   Fertilization. Adequate quantities of the essential nutrient elements
should be available after new root growth starts. However, provision of good
drainage and adequate moisture of the backfill, or the soil ball on balled
plants, is more important than fertilization immediately following planting.
   (D)   Insect and Disease Control. Frequent and thorough inspections shall be
made to determine when measures for the control of insects and diseases shall
be taken. Plants are in a weakened condition following transplanting, and they
are more susceptible to insects, especially borers, and disease than are
vigorously growing trees. Where it is necessary, proper insecticides or
fungicides shall be used that are labeled for the purpose intended.
   (E)   Pruning.
      (1)   Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead or
injured branches. The suppression of rank, uneven growth affects form. Water
sprouts shall be removed when they reach the diameter of a pencil.
      (2)   Pruning shall be practices as often thereafter as needed for sturdy
crotch development.
      (3)   Tree crowns should be elevated as growth characteristics dictate.
Newly planted trees need not have lower branches removed until they are well-
established.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.125 GENERAL MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Pruning and removal.
      (1)   No topping or dehorning of trees shall be permitted except by
written permission of the Village Forester. Proper cabling and bracing shall be
substituted for this practice wherever possible.
      (2)   All large established trees shall be pruned to allow free passage
of pedestrians and vehicular traffic at least seven feet over sidewalks and a
minimum clearance of 14 feet over all streets.
      (3)   It shall be the policy of the Village Forester to cooperate with
the Village Engineer and vice versa regarding placement and selection of
lighting standards and the selection of a system of tree pruning that will give
effective sight elimination.
      (4)   All cuts shall be made with a saw or pruner and only at collars or
crotches. No stubs shall be left. No spurs or claws shall be used in the trees.
      (5)   All dead branches shall be removed.
      (6)   All wounds over three inches in diameter shall be covered with a
suitable tree-wounding dressing.
      (7)   To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, all pruning tools
must be disinfected before being used on a new tree.
      (8)   Whenever streets are to be blocked off to public service, all
police and fire departments shall be notified of the location and length of
time the street will be blocked. Notifications shall be given these departments
upon the removal of such barriers or if such barriers are to remain longer than
originally expected.
      (9)   To protect the public from danger, suitable street and sidewalk
barriers, highway cones, or signs shall be used when pruning a tree. Signals,
flares or flasher lights shall be placed on all barriers or obstructions
remaining in the street after dark.
      (10)   The stumps of all removed trees shall be cut to at least six
inches below the ground level. The soil cavity shall be filled with soils and
the area leveled.
   (B)   Spraying.
      (1)   Suitable precautions shall be taken to protect and warn the public
that spraying is being done.
      (2)   Spraying shall be done only for the control of specific diseases or
insects with the proper materials in the necessary strength and applied at the
proper time to obtain the desired control. All spraying practices shall conform
to federal and state regulations.
      (3)   Dormant oil sprays shall not be applied to sugar maple, Japanese
maple, beech, flowering dogwood, hickory, walnut, and most crabapple trees.
Dormant oil sprays shall be applied only when the air temperature is at least
40 degrees for a period of 24 hours after spraying.
   (C)   Fertilization.
      (1)   Fertilization of public trees shall follow the recommendations of
the Natural History Survey or other accepted arboricultural standards.
      (2)   Methods of application of fertilizers shall be specified by the
Village Forester.
   (D)   Cavities. Extensive cavity work should be performed on trees only if
they are of sufficiently high value to justify the cost. All cavity work shall
conform to the National Arborist Association or other acceptable arboricultural
standards.
   (E)   Cabling and bracing.
      (1)   As a general rule, cables should be located above the crotch at a
point approximately two-thirds of the distance between the crotch and the tops
of the branch ends. Rust-resistant cables, thimbles, and lags should be used.
The ends of a cable should be attached to hooks or eyes or lags or bolts
inserted near the ends of the branches. Thimbles must be used in the eye splice
in each end of the cable. In no instance shall cable be wrapped around a
branch.
      (2)   All cabling and bracing practices with screw rods shall follow
National Arborist Association or other accepted arboricultural standards.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.126 TREE PROTECTION.
   (A)   Construction zone.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the permit holder, as a condition of
the permit, to protect all public trees located on the adjacent public right-
of-way that may reasonably be expected to be affected or damaged by
construction activities. Existing trees subject to construction damage shall be
boxed, fenced, or otherwise protected before any work is started. The trees to
be protected, the method of protection, and the dimensions involved shall be
determined by the Village Forester conjunctly with the permit holder or his/her
agent. Once assembled, no boxing, fencing or other protection device shall be
removed without prior approval of the Village Forester, and there will be no
construction activity or material within the enclosure.
      (2)   Dimensions. Small trees as determined by the Village Forester shall
be boxed or fenced in such a manner as to encompass the entire drip line area
of the tree (Figure 1). In no case shall the enclosure be less than two feet
from the centerline of the tree. Medium to large trees shall be boxed or fenced
in a manner determined by the Village Forester based on sound arboricultural
practices. In no case shall the protective device be closer than ten feet from
the centerline of the tree except in those portions bordered by the public
sidewalk or curb, in which case the protective device shall be offset one foot
wherever possible.

   (B)   Utility installations (underground).
      (1)   All installations or underground utilities upon the public rights-
of-way are subject to approval by the village. Any and all installations that
impact on public trees due to underground conflicts (roots) are specifically
subject to the review and approval of the Village Forester before the project
starts.
      (2)   Trenching small trees. Open trenching in the root zone area of a
public tree is prohibited except in cases where the trenching falls outside the
dripline of the tree involved. In some instances, exceptions may be allowed if
in the opinion of the Village Forester the impact of trenching upon the tree
will be negligible.

      (3)   Trenching and tunneling – medium to large trees. When the dripline
of trees becomes extensive or overlapping, the only reasonable means of utility
installation on the public right-of-way is a combination of trenching and
tunneling. This applies particularly to trees in excess of five inches in
diameter. All trees in excess of five inches in diameter where there is
insufficient space to bypass the dripline by trenching must be tunneled. In no
case shall the tunnel be less than two feet in depth. The tunneling procedure
is determined by the diameter of the trees four and one-half feet from the
ground line. Unless specified otherwise by the Village Forester, all dimensions
apply as provided in the above table.
      (4)   Since cutting of larger roots is unavoidable in a trenching
operation, all roots over two inches in diameter must be cut cleanly and
painted with an appropriate tree-wound dressing. All trenches should not stay
open longer than necessary and must be properly barricaded.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.127 CONTAINER PLANTING.
   (A)   Installation requirements.
      (1)   No container may be placed in a manner which violates the
visibility triangle, nor may any container be placed on public property where
such would constitute a visibility hazard.
      (2)   The planting medium shall be of sufficient volume to support and
sustain plant materials, and the design and construction details shall be
approved by the Village Forester.
   (B)   Maintenance of containers.
      (1)   Containers, plants and their maintenance become the responsibility
of the abutting property owner.
      (2)   All costs arising from the establishment, maintenance or removal of
plants or plant containers are to be borne by the abutting property owner.
      (3)   Containers, plants and their contents must be maintained in the
condition specified by original design at all times. Any planter not serving
its designed aesthetical function shall be replanted or removed.
   (C)   Notice to replant or remove. Any container and/or plant material not
maintained to quality and design standard, as required by the Village Forester,
is hereby declared a nuisance. Anyone failing to abate such a nuisance after
notice is given shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and the Village Forester may
remove such nuisance.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.128 REMOVAL POLICY.
   (A)   It is the objective and the responsibility of the Village Forester to
promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public by
providing for the regulation of the planting, maintenance and removal of trees,
shrubs and other plants within the village. As specified by ordinance, the only
person who may authorize the planting or removal of a village tree is the
Village Forester or his or her designated agent. Accordingly, a village tree
may be considered for removal if it is deemed by the Village Forester to
constitute a public nuisance (hazard) as defined in the following ways:
      (1)   Any dead or dying tree.
      (2)   Any otherwise healthy tree which harbors insects or diseases which
could reasonably be expected to seriously injure or harm any other tree.
      (3)   Any tree which, by reason of location or condition, constitutes an
eminent danger to the health, safety or welfare of the general public. In the
category of dangerous or hazardous trees are those with observable, critical
structural defects that could cause the tree to fail during periods of stress
(i.e. wind or ice storms). Included are extensive rot or cavity formations,
weak forks or crotches, and/or other characteristics that would impose an
immediate liability on the village.
   (B)   Not included in the definition of a tree as a public nuisance or
immediate hazard, as defined, are the following:
      (1)   Species of trees currently classified as undesirable and thereby
prohibited from being planted on village-owned property, as listed in Table II
of these standards and specifications, with the following exceptions:
         (a)   Any individual tree listed in Table II that is declared a public
nuisance by the Village Forester that meets the specification for removal as
previously identified.
         (b)   Any individual or species of tree listed in Table II that is
designated by the Village Forester as being part of a scheduled village-wide
replacement program designated to upgrade the village's tree population.
      (2)   Individual trees, regardless of species or kind, that pose either
an imminent or potential hazard for which corrective action can be taken.
      (3)   Trees that constitute an inconvenience to the public by virtue of
leaf, twig or fruit drop; that act as sources of allergies; that cause root
blockage in sanitary or storm tiles; that are subject to diseases or insect
problems which cause only minor harm to trees.
      (4)   Trees that constitute an inconvenience to the public by virtue of
their location, except those public trees that pose serious obstruction
problems in terms of egress or access to private property or new construction
projects or the alteration of established private facilities. The removal of a
public tree for purposes of accommodating private facilities will not be
sanctioned unless the following conditions have been satisfied:
         (a)   There are no other reasonable design alternatives.
         (b)   The value of the tree(s) in question has been determined by the
Village Forester in accordance with the latest revision of "A Guide to the
Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs and Evergreens" as
published by the International Society of Arboriculture.
         (c)   The village must be compensated for the loss of the tree(s) by
the property owner before removal is undertaken by the village.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.129 STREET CLOSURE AND REOPENING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Notify all police and fire departments of street closure and duration
of closure.
   (B)   Close street and sidewalk with proper signs, barriers, barrier tape
and cones.
   (C)   Remove street-closure barriers in this order: barrier tape, cones,
barriers and signs.
   (D)   Notify all police and fire departments of street reopening.
   (E)   Remove all warning signs. When temporarily leaving work site, always
leave one lane clear of obstruction for emergency traffic.
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.130 TREE DAMAGE POLICY.
   (A)   Immediately upon receiving information indicating damage to a village
tree, the Village Forester, or a qualified agent of the Village Forester, is to
inspect the tree and complete a "Tree Evaluation" to determine the dollar value
of the damages incurred to the tree.
   (B)   The information is to be forwarded to the Collections Department with
a copy of the "Employee Report of Property Damage". Responsible parties will be
billed for damages incurred as determined by the procedures established by the
International Society of Arboriculture and published as a "Guide for
Establishing Values of Trees and Other Plants".
(Ord. 07-57, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 57.131 AMENDMENTS.
   The Village Forester shall have the authority to modify, amend, or extend,
with the advice and consent of the Tree Committee, the Village Forestry
Standards and Specifications at any time that experience indicates improved
methods or whenever circumstances make it advisable.

of East Dundee Electric Code, and these Engineering Standards.
   (B)   Manufacturer's information including catalog cuts for all materials
not specifically approved on the plans but required to install said street
light(s) into a working lighting system acceptable to the village shall be
submitted to the village for approval. All manufacturer's information and
catalog cuts must be approved by the Village Engineer prior to the commencement
of any portion of said work.
   (C)   The contractor shall confirm the location of the service drop and
connection with Commonwealth Edison and submit for approval to the Village
Engineer a plan or sketch of said electrical service to the proposed street
light(s) prior to the beginning of any street lighting construction. The plan
or sketch should also include the name and approval signature of the person at
Commonwealth Edison Company who has approved the plan.
   (D)   When requested by the village, a printout of illumination levels
point-by-point throughout the area to be lighted shall be submitted by the
developer's engineer or contractor to the Village Engineer for review and
approval of the proposed lighting system.
   (E)   Upon completion of the installation of the street light(s), the
contractor shall furnish "Record Drawings" of the work to the Village Engineer.

      (1)   Poles shall be located at all intersections and spaced at a
distance not exceeding 300 feet from one another along the street. Poles shall
also be located at the ends of cul-de-sacs and curves in the roadway as
required by the Village Engineer. Poles shall be set in the parkway a minimum
of two feet clear distance from the back of curb. Where the distance between
the sidewalk and the curb is such that this location is impractical or where
the sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, the Village Engineer shall be consulted
for an acceptable alternate location for the pole.
      (2)   Unless otherwise directed by the Village Engineer, the direction of
the support arm shall be at right angles to the centerline of one of the
intersecting streets at a four-legged intersection with location preference to
the higher classification roadway, if applicable. At "T" intersections, a pole
shall be provided on the centerline extended from the terminating street at the
top of the "T" with the support arm extending toward the center of the
intersection. In cul-de-sacs, light poles shall be placed in the center median
or if no center median is to be constructed, at the end of the cul-de-sac along
the centerline extended.

types of materials, dimensions, thickness of material, method of fabrication,
and description of details of items to be incorporated into the work meeting
with the village's approval.
   (F)   The contractor shall be fully responsible for the plumbness of the
poles. One of the following methods is recommended:
      (1)   The pole shall be considered plumb when a 48 inch or larger spirit
level, with offsets at the top equal to the pole taper, indicates when used at
eye level, that the center line of the pole is within one-half inch per ten
feet of true vertical in any direction.
      (2)   The pole shall be considered plumb when the center of the top is
directly over the center of the base as determined by viewing the pole through
a tripod mounted, accurate, quality transit from two angles at least 60 degrees
apart. Deviation shall not exceed one-half inch in ten feet.
   (G)   The foundation shall be installed with its axis plumb so that the
light pole may be installed plumb without the use of shims, grout or other
leveling devices.

   (I)   All installation of the cable and conduit between poles shall be
placed in trenches a minimum of six inches wide and 24 inches below design
subgrade elevation.
      (1)   There shall be no sharp bends where the conduit enters the trench,
compacted approved fill shall be built up to half-fill the opening in the
conduit so that emerging cable conduit will have a smooth bed at this critical
point. If the trench depth is less than 12 inches because of obstructions, the
contractor shall cut a groove in such obstruction so the trench is a minimum of
12 inches deep. The cable conduit shall be laid in this groove, anchored to
prevent floating and covered to grade. Where trench depth exceeds 12 inches but
is less than 24 inches deep, any material excavated from the trench, which in
the opinion of the Village Engineer is satisfactory backfilling material, may
be used. Cinders, frozen earth, or other deleterious materials will not be
permitted in the backfill. Stone used in backfill shall be less than two inches
in any dimension.
      (2)   Backfilling shall be completed as soon as possible after
inspection. Backfill shall be deposited in uniform layers not to exceed six
inches thick loose measure. The material in each layer shall be mechanical
compacted in a manner approved by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   The village reserves the right to make inspections of the trench
construction and at any other stage it designates.
   (J)   Wiring test.
      (1)   The tests outlined in this section are field tests to be performed
in the presence of the Village Engineer's representative. They shall be
performed by the contractor's personnel and their equipment. Defects shall be
corrected and testing repeated until all sections of the installation are
sound. Splicing or repairing of insulation below grade is not permissible
except in a handhole.
      (2)   All construction shall be completed before tests are made. The
poles shall be erected, with ballasts and lamps in place. Trenches shall be
backfilled and all connections shall be made.
      (3)   Insulation resistance shall be measured with a megger generating
not less than 500 or more than 1,000 volts. A multimeter is not acceptable
because it applies only a few volts which will permit some insulation defects
to go undetected. Erratic behavior of the megger during the test indicates an
intermittent weakness which must be corrected. Only the lower value indicated
shall be considered or recorded.
      (4)   The Village Engineer's representative shall log the serial number
and voltage rating of the megger used by the contractor. He shall then confirm
the calibration of the megger by connecting the two leads of the megger
together so that the resistance to be measured by the megger when it is turned
at full speed is zero. Unless this is true, the megger will give false reading
under all other circumstances as well.
      (5)   Each circuit shall be permanently tagged for identification and
then tested at the control centers. The full voltage of the megger shall be
applied between ground and each insulated wire in each circuit. The ground
shall consist of a driven, copper-clad rod 8' x 5/8" or larger connected by #8
wire to the ground terminal in the control cabinet. Circuits shall be isolated
from each other by opening the circuit breakers.
      (6)   The minimum, acceptable resistance to ground shown by the megger
shall be 250,000 ohms. The tests shall be conducted as follows:
         (a)   Test at each pole location from handhole to the last light in a
string of lights. Locate any faults in underground cable before connecting
lamps.
         (b)   Test each lamp assembly at handhole using the #10 downwire in
each of the lamp poles. Correct any faults.
         (c)   Test the complete system with all connections made except the
fuses will not be installed in the switch box. Test the system from fuse output
lug to ground at the switch box.
         (d)   If a service center, check each circuit at the breaker output in
the control center.
         (e)   All tests shall be conducted in the presence of a representative
of the village or the Village Engineer.
      (7)   With all lamps "on" for a minimum of five minutes, measure the
voltage at the fuse output lug in the safety switch box. Then using the same
meter, measure the voltage to the last light in the string at the handhole
connection in the base of the pole for that lamp. The percent of voltage drop
from the supply fuse to the lamp shall not be more than 2%.
      (8)   A test log shall be used during the test noting all results and
identifying all meters used. Test logs will be signed by the contractor's
representative and the Village Engineer's witness.
   (K)   Service and control center.
      (1)   Service centers, if used, shall be established at such points as
are found feasible for the area to be serviced. The final selection of a
service and control center shall be approved by the Village Engineer and the
Commonwealth Edison Co. At each service center, the service switch and circuit
breaker shall be mounted in a weather-proof cabinet made of rust-resistant
metal or aluminum and shall be marked "Street Lighting". This cabinet shall be
equal to Crouse Hinds #27394 adapter.
      (2)   The cabinet shall be mounted on an 18 inch diameter concrete base
4'-0" deep cast in place consisting of four vertical rods and #3 rings 12
inches and on center for reinforcing. The top of the base shall be two and one-
half inches (+1/2") above finished grade. The base shall include a two inch
feeder conduit with standard radius and one and one-half inch service conduit
connected directly to the meter socket as required by Commonwealth Edison Co.
All feeder and supply conduit shall enter the cabinet from the bottom.
      (3)   The service center distribution cabinet shall be securely grounded
by driving into the ground a 3/4" x 10' copperweld ground rod inside concrete
base of a cabinet and connected to control panel ground terminal. On the back
of the control center shall be mounted the meter socket for the mounting of the
service meter. The control center cabinet shall be provided with a secure
locking facility and duplicate keys must be provided for same.

   Consistent with the requirements of the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act (Public Act § 100-585), and in anticipation of a continued increased demand
for placement of small wireless facilities of the type regulated by the act
both within the public rights-of-way and in other locations within the
jurisdiction of the village, the Village Board has found it to be in the best
interests of the public health, safety and general welfare of the village to
adopt the code amendments set forth in this chapter in order to establish
generally applicable standards for the design, permitting, location,
construction, deployment, regulation, operation, maintenance, repair and
removal of such small wireless facilities both within the public rights-of-way
and in other locations within the jurisdiction of the village so as to, among
other things:
   (A)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located both within public
rights-of-way and in other locations within the jurisdiction of the village;
   (B)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which such small
wireless facilities are installed;
   (C)   Minimize any adverse visual impact of small wireless facilities and
prevent visual blight in the neighborhoods in which such facilities are
installed;

may cure the deficiencies identified in the notice of denial and resubmit a
revised application once within 30 days after the notice of denial is sent
without payment of an additional application fee. The village shall have 30
days to approve or deny the resubmitted application or it is deemed approved,
if the applicant has notified the village of its intention to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which notification may be
submitted with the resubmitted application. Review of a resubmitted application
is limited to the deficiencies cited in the original notice of denial. This
division does not apply if a revised application is not resubmitted within 30
days, or curing any deficiencies in the original application requires review of
a new location, new or different structure for collocation, new antennas, or
other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. In such
cases, a new application and application fee are required.
   (J)   Consolidated applications. Consolidated applications for small

shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the same type
of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. Each
consolidated application shall provide all the information required by this
chapter for each small wireless facility at each location. If such an
application includes incomplete information for one or more small wireless
facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless facilities that
do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are otherwise denied, the
village may remove such collocation requests from the application and treat
them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued for each collocation
approved in a consolidated application.
   (K)   Alternate locations. If an applicant is seeking to install a new
utility pole as part of its application, the village may propose that the small
wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless
support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation. The applicant
shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has the right to use
the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless the alternate location
imposes technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the
applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location based on the
foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence in the form
of a written certification, under oath, describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate location
from being utilized.

§ 59.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Public safety technology. A wireless provider's operation of a small
wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this code.
   (B)   A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any wireless
facility that:
      (1)   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on

Plant materials shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting
materials. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance
of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
      (4)   Future undergrounding. The village may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the village shall
either:
         (a)   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         (b)   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   (F)   Collocation limits.
      (1)   Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      (2)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      (3)   For purposes of this division, the terms "communications space,"
"communication worker safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   (G)   Code compliance. Wireless providers shall comply with applicable codes
and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
   (H)   In the event the village, in its reasonable discretion, deems it
necessary to remove, relocate or replace a utility pole or wireless support
structure, the village shall notify wireless provider at least 180 days prior
of the need to remove or relocate its small wireless facility. In such event,
the village shall provide options for alternative locations for the wireless
provider's relocation of equipment which shall be in a mutually agreeable
location ("Alternative Premises"). The wireless provider shall be solely
responsible for all costs related to the relocation of its small wireless
facility to the alternative premises. In the event that a suitable alternative
premises cannot be identified, the wireless provider may terminate the
applicable permit. In the event of an emergency, the village must provide as
much notice as reasonably practical under the circumstances.

      (1)   Alarms caused by the failure or malfunction of the equipment
located at the P.S.A.P.;
      (2)   Alarms occurring on a repeated basis without apparent cause within
the first 60 days after installation of the alarm system, and where continuous
effort, in the sole opinion of the Alarm Administrator, is being made jointly

(1981 Code, § 15.01) (Ord. 96-18, passed 9-3-1996; Am. Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-
2020)
§ 90.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)    The primary purpose of this chapter is to reduce the number of
unnecessary responses by public safety personnel to mechanically or
electronically activated burglar, hold-up, fire and medical emergency alarms
and to charge the cost of such responses to that portion of the village’s
resident and business population wishing to use or required to use such alarms.
   (B)   False or unnecessary alarms severely impact and endanger the safety
and general welfare of the residents of the village. In addition to the
significant cost involved in responding to such alarms and the concurrent loss
of manpower and ineffective utilization of equipment, such alarms require
emergency responses which may contribute to a high accident rate.
   (C)   False alarms will be reduced by imposing certain regulations on alarm
systems and charging the cost of alarm responses to that portion of the village
resident and business population that use such alarms. Therefore, the village
adopts these regulations and imposes, among other things, a gradually
increasing service charge on the occurrence of more than four alarms for an
alarm system in one calendar year. In addition, the failure to pay service
charges or permit fees, the occurrence of 11 or more alarm occurrences in one
calendar year, and the failure to otherwise comply with this chapter, may
constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of an alarm user permit, which
may result in public safety personnel not responding to additional alarm
occurrences.
   (D)   Nothing in this chapter, however, shall be deemed to require or
obligate public safety personnel to respond to an alarm. Nothing herein shall
preclude public safety personnel from responding to any call or request for
assistance that is other than an alarm occurrence (i.e., notification of the
public safety personnel by means other than activation of an alarm system).
(Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-2020)
§ 90.03 SERVICING OF ALARM SYSTEMS.
   An alarm business or user shall not perform any service on any alarm system
in the village without first notifying the Public Safety Answering Point and
disconnecting the alarm at the alarm user’s end and again notifying the Public
Safety Answering Point upon completion of the work.
(1981 Code, § 15.03) (Ord. 96-18, passed 9-3-1996; Am. Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-
2020)
§ 90.04 CENTRAL STATIONS.
   No one shall operate a central station or emergency answering service in the
village unless licensed as an alarm business.
(1981 Code, § 15.04) (Ord. 96-18, passed 9-3-1996; Am. Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-
2020)    
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 90.05 AUTOMATIC VOICE DIALING ALARMS.
    No person shall use, cause, permit to be used, or engage in the business of
providing any telephone device and/or telephone attachment that automatically
dials any village telephone line, or 911 lines connected to the Public Safety
Answering Point and then reproduces any voice message to report any robbery,
burglary, fire or other emergency.
(1981 Code, § 15.05) (Ord. 96-18, passed 9-3-1996; Am. Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-
2020)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 90.06 ALARM USER PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (A)    It shall be unlawful for any alarm user to use, own or lease an alarm
system or to be in control of an alarm site wherein an alarm system is operated
or maintained without having first obtained a permit for that system.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any alarm user to use, own or lease an alarm
system or to be in control of an alarm site wherein an alarm system is operated
or maintained when a permit therefor has been suspended, revoked or expired.
   (C)   The following bi-annual fees shall be charged to obtain an alarm user
permit:
      (1)   An initial alarm user permit shall be $15.
      (2)   Renewal of an alarm user permit shall be $10.
   (D)   All permits issued are valid for two calendar years unless the permit
is revoked or suspended.
(1981 Code, § 15.06) (Ord. 96-18, passed 9-3-1996; Am. Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-
2020)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 90.07 ALARM USER PERMIT.
   (A)    Any person who desires to install, maintain or use an alarm system,
including on-premises alarm systems, shall first make application to the Alarm

      (1)   The applicant has failed to pay required false alarm fees for the
alarm site or for a different alarm site under the applicant’s ownership or

(1981 Code, § 15.06) (Ord. 96-18, passed 9-3-1996; Am. Ord. 20-20, passed 5-18-
2020)
§ 90.08 REVOCATION/SUSPENSION OF ALARM USER PERMIT.
   (A)   An alarm user permit may be revoked by the Alarm Administrator under
the following circumstances:
      (1)   More than ten false alarms are recorded in a calendar year from any
alarm system for which a permit has been issued;
      (2)   Failure to pay false alarm or user permit fees; or
      (3)    Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter
within ten days after receiving notification of a violation, in writing, from
the Alarm Administrator.
   (B)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify the alarm user by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or personal delivery that the village intends to
revoke its alarm user permit within 15 days from the date of receipt of the
notice. Said notice shall further advise that the alarm user may submit, within
ten days of the date of receipt, a written request for review to the Village
Administrator, setting forth the reasons that the alarm user permit should not
be revoked or other action taken. The submission of the request shall suspend
revocation of the alarm user permit.
   (C)   If the alarm user fails to submit a request for review within the
stated time period, the Village Administrator shall review the record of the
permit and the grounds for revocation and make a determination regarding
revocation based upon those records. If revocation is ordered, the Village
Administrator shall then issue a written order of revocation, which shall
include an explanation of the consequences of revocation. The written order
shall be sent to the alarm user by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
personal delivery. Revocation shall be effective on the date following review
or the original revocation date, whichever is later. If revocation is not
ordered, notice to that effect shall be sent in the same manner.
   (D)   If a request for review is submitted within the stated time period, a
written notice of the time and place of the review shall be served on the alarm
user by the Village Administrator by first class mail or personal delivery at
least ten days prior to the date set for the review.
   (E)   At the requested review before the Village Administrator, the Alarm
Administrator and the alarm user, or his or her authorized representative,
shall have the right to present evidence. Upon completion of the review, the
Village Administrator may either enter an order of revocation, withdraw the
notice of revocation, suspend the permit until such time that he or she is
satisfied that the cause or causes of the false alarms have been eliminated, or
take such other action as may be appropriate. The alarm user, who was present
or represented at the review, will receive no further notice of revocation. An
alarm user having no representation at the review shall be notified by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery, of the action
of the Village Administrator. Revocation shall be effective on the first
business day following completion of the review.
   (F)   Any alarm user, whose alarm user permit has been revoked pursuant to
this section, shall have the right, within ten days of the determination of
revocation, to file a written appeal with the Village Board. No alarm user
shall be required to discontinue use of its alarm system prior to the
expiration of the ten-day period. The appeal shall set forth the specific
grounds on which it is based. The Village Board shall hold a hearing on the
appeal within 30 days after its receipt. At the hearing, the appellant or a
designated representative shall have the right to present written or oral
argument in support of the appeal. The Village Board shall issue its decision
within ten days after the hearing, which decision shall be effective upon alarm
user’s receipt of notice by certified mail, receipt requested, or personal
delivery.
   (G)   Reinstatement of revoked user permit: The alarm user must submit to
the Alarm Administrator a new alarm user permit application, payment of past
due fees, fines and a reinstatement fee in the amount set forth in
Chapter 37, Fees and Fines, along with a written explanation of the action that
the alarm user has taken to substantially reduce the likelihood of false
alarms. Upon the Alarm Administrator’s determination that the aforementioned
conditions have been met, the alarm user permit may be reinstated; provided,
however, that no revoked alarm user permit may be reinstated within the six-
month period following the effective date of the revocation, unless the Alarm
Administrator, in his or her sole and absolute discretion, approves a shorter
period. Upon reinstatement, the alarm user shall be in the same position, for
purposes of calculating alarm occurrences and services charges, as an alarm
user that has received an alarm user permit for the first time.

§ 90.09 ON-PREMISES ALARM; OUTSIDE RINGERS.
   (A)   No person shall use, allow or cause to exist an outside ringer which
emits an audible sound in any manner similar to the village’s emergency
vehicles. In addition, the sound shall be distinguishable from any and all
village alert systems broadcast in an audible manner.
   (B)   (1)   All outside ringers shall be equipped with an automatic shut-off
which will deactivate within five minutes of the initial alarm.
      (2)   Failure to provide the shut-off shall result in the immediate
suspension of the alarm user permit and shall be in violation of this chapter.
   (C)   In addition to any other remedies provided by this chapter, the Alarm
Administrator may order the immediate suspension of an alarm user permit and
removal or deactivation of an alarm system based upon knowledge of the misuse
or improper maintenance of an outside ringer.
   (D)   This section shall not apply to water flow alarms required by the Fire
Prevention Code for automatic fire suppression equipment installed in any
structure, which are programmed either to:
      (1)   Activate the communication swinger suppression after three
activations; or
      (2)   Allow only single alarming per alarm zone per armed period.

sale or disposed of as provided herein, the owner or other person legally
entitled to its possession may reclaim the vehicle by presenting to the Police
Department proof of ownership or proof of the right to possession of the
vehicle. No vehicle shall be released to the owner or other person under this
division (H) until all towing and storage charges have been paid.
   (I)   (1)   Whenever an abandoned, lost, stolen or unclaimed motor vehicle
or other vehicle, seven years of age or newer, remains unclaimed by the
registered owner or other person legally entitled to its possession for a
period of 30 days after notice has been given, as provided herein, the Police
Department, having possession of the vehicle, shall cause it to be sold at
public sale to the highest bidder. Notice of the time and place of the sale
shall be posted in a conspicuous place for at least ten days prior to the sale
on the premises where the vehicle has been impounded. At least ten days prior

of the sale to be sent by certified mail to the registered owner or other
person known by the Police Department or towing service to be legally entitled
to the possession of the vehicle. The notice shall contain a complete
description of the vehicle to be sold and what steps must be taken by any
legally entitled person to reclaim the vehicle.
      (2)   In those instances where the certified notification specified

determination of disposition and an examination of the State Police stolen
motor vehicle files for theft and wanted information. At the expiration of the
ten-day period, without the benefit of disposition information being received
from the registered owner, the Chief of Police will authorize the disposal of
the vehicle as junk only.
      (3)   A motor vehicle or other vehicle classified as an antique vehicle
is excluded herefrom.
   (K)   When a motor vehicle or other vehicle in the custody of the Police
Department is reclaimed by the registered owner or other legally entitled

the species of tall, common or European Barberry, otherwise known as Barberis
Vulgaris, or its horticultural varieties found growing in any place or location

the owner or the owner and occupant jointly to pay the expense.
   (D)   (1)   The village shall have a continuing lien upon the premises and
real estate upon which any noxious weeds or tall grasses or bushes shall be
caused or permitted to grow in violation of the provisions of this section, for
or on account of which it is necessary for any expense to be suffered or
incurred by the village for the cutting, destroying or otherwise removing of
any weed or tall grasses, plants or bushes. Every lien shall, upon compliance
with the conditions hereinafter set forth, become and be prior and superior to

amount due by virtue of its provisions when the same shall become due, the
village may file or cause to be filed a petition or bill in the appropriate

corporate name, to foreclose the lien in like manner and with like effect as
provided by the Illinois Compiled Statutes in foreclosure of mortgages. The
suit shall be commenced within two years after the accrual of the expense or
cost or charge. Any decree rendered in court may be enforced and collected as
other decrees or judgements in the court.
      (2)   The remedy provided in this section shall not be construed to
abridge or in any manner interfere with the right and power of the village to
enforce the collection thereof by an action at law or as otherwise provided in
this section, but the remedy herein provided shall be taken and held as an
additional means to enforce payment of the delinquent expense or cost or
charge.

as not to constitute a fire hazard.
         (g)   If the Village Administrator, Police Chief or Code Enforcement
Officer or any officer of a fire department or police department concludes that

the village; a separate license shall be required for each location. For the

   (E)   Inspections. The Village Administrator may require inspections to
determine whether the location in connection with which such license is in

applicable rules and regulations pursuant thereto. After inspection, no such
license shall be issued unless the location is found to meet all applicable

herein provided. Such notice shall state that unless the violations cited are
corrected within reasonable time, the license may be suspended.
      (2)   At the end of the time allowed for correction of any violation
cited, the Building Official or designee shall reinspect the location, and if
the reinspection reveals that such conditions have not been corrected, a
request to the Village Administrator to suspend the license may be made.

the village’s administrative adjudication system or file a complaint against
the owner in the circuit court.
      (4)   Any person whose license has been recommended for suspension shall
be entitled to an appeal to the Village Administrator in the manner provided by
this title. Any written request for appeal shall be filed with the Village
Administrator within 15 days following the issuance of the notice.
      (5)   If, upon reinspection, the Building Official or designee finds that
the location in connection with which the notice was issued is now in
compliance with this chapter and with the applicable rules and regulations
issued pursuant thereto, a recommendation of the reinstatement of the license
may be made to the Village Administrator.
      (6)   When the Building Official or designee determines after an initial
inspection that additional follow up inspections are necessary for enforcement
of this chapter, one additional follow up inspection for noncompliance shall be
granted each license holder without charge. In the event more than one follow
up inspection is needed, the license holder shall be assessed a noncompliance
inspection service charge to make the reinspection. Payments must be made in
full prior to the license being renewed. Failure to pay any balance will serve
as grounds to deny further permits or licenses from being issued by the
village.

property shall lease only pursuant to a written lease containing their rules
and regulations and utilize a crime free lease addendum or have a clause in the

lease addendum shall be provided by the village to any owner, agent or designee
of residential rental property. The clause is to make criminal activity (not
limited to violent criminal activity or drug related criminal activity engaged
by, facilitated by or permitted by the renter, member of the household, guest
or other party under the control of the renter) a lease violation. The landlord
shall have authority under that clause to initiate an eviction proceeding as
specified in the Illinois Compiled Statutes Forcible Entry and Detainer
statutes. Proof of criminal violation in the Forcible Entry and Detainer
Statutes shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.

on the former prosecution; or was for an offense with which the defendant

trial, which required a determination inconsistent with any fact necessary to a
conviction in the subsequent prosecution; or

Circuit Court of Kane County or in a sister Circuit Court in Illinois for an
offense which is within the concurrent jurisdiction of the village, if the

prosecution is for the same conduct unless each prosecution requires proof of
fact not required in the other prosecution or the offense was not consummated
when the former trial began; or

before trial, which required a determination inconsistent with any fact
necessary to a conviction in the prosecution in the village.

former prosecution:
      (1)   Was before a court which lacked jurisdiction over the defendant or
the offense; or

the statute defining the offense, he or she acts while having one of the mental
states described herein.
   (B)   (1)   If the statute defining an offense prescribed a particular
mental state with respect to the offense as a whole without distinguishing
among the elements thereof, the prescribed mental state applies to each such

§ 130.040 RECKLESSNESS.
   (A)   A person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she conscious
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
that a result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense and

as provided herein, is a defense if it negates the existence of a mental state
which the statute prescribes with respect to an element of the offense.
   (B)   A person’s reasonable belief that his or her conduct does not
constitute an offense is a defense if:
      (1)   The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order
which is not known to him or her has not been published or otherwise made
reasonably available to him or her, and he or she could not have acquired the
knowledge by the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him or
her;

statute, regulation or order defining the offense, made by a public officer or
agency legally authorized to interpret the statute.
   (C)   Although a person’s ignorance or mistake of fact or law or reasonable
belief, described in this section, is a defense to the offense charged, he or
she may be convicted of an included offense of which he or she would be guilty
if the fact or law were as he or she believed it to be.

   (C)   (1)   Either before or during the commission of an offense and with
the intent to promote or facilitate the commission, he or she solicits, aids,
abets, agrees or attempts to aid, the other person in the planning or
commission of the offense.

the offense provides otherwise, if:
         (a)   He or she is victim if the offense committed;
         (b)   The offense is so defined that his conduct was inevitability
incident to its commission; or
         (c)   Before the commission of the offense he or she terminates his or
her effort to promote or facilitate the commission and does one of the
following: wholly deprives his or her prior efforts of effectiveness in the

has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense, is not amenable
to justice or has been acquitted.

but only if:
      (1)   The offense is a misdemeanor, is defined hereby or is defined by
another statute which clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose
liability on a corporation; and an agent of the corporation performs the
conduct which is an element of the offense while acting within the scope of his
or her office or employment and in behalf of the corporation, except that any
limitation in the defining statute, concerning the corporation’s accountability
for certain agents or under certain circumstances, is applicable; or
      (2)   The commission of the offense is authorized, requested, commanded
or performed, by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent who is
acting within the scope of his or her employment in behalf of the corporation.
   (B)   (1)   A corporation’s proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the high managerial agent having supervisory responsibility over the conduct
which is the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent
the commission of the offense, is a defense to a prosecution for any offense to
which division (A)(1) above refers, other than of offense for which absolute
liability is imposed.
      (2)   This division is inapplicable if the legislative purpose of the
statute defining the offense is inconsistent with the provisions of this
division.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply

capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct or to
conform his or her conduct to the requirements of law.

JUSTIFIABLE USE OF FORCE; EXONERATION
§ 130.085 USE OF FORCE IN DEFENSE OF PERSON.

extent he or she reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary to defend
himself or herself or another against such other’s imminent use of unlawful
force. However, he or she is justified in the use of force which is intended or
likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he or she reasonably
believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily
harm to himself or herself or another or the commission of a forcible felony.
   (B)   In no case shall any act involving the use of force justified under
this section give rise to any claim or liability brought by or on behalf of any
person acting within the definition of "aggressor" set forth in ILCS Chapter
720, Act 5, § 7-4, or the estate, spouse, or other family member of such a
person, against the person or estate of the person using such justified force,
unless the use of force involves willful or wanton misconduct.
(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-1) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-1)
§ 130.086 USE OF FORCE IN DEFENSE OF DWELLING.
   (A)   A person is justified in the use of force against when and to the
extent that he or she reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary to
prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry into or attack upon a
dwelling.
   However, he or she is justified in the use of force which is intended or
likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if:
      (1)   The entry is made or attempted in a violent, riotous or tumultuous
manner and he or she reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent
an assault upon, or offer of personal violence to him or her or another in the
dwelling; or
      (2)   He or she reasonably believes that the force is necessary to
prevent the commission of a felony in the dwelling.
   (B)   In no case shall any act involving the use of force justified under
this section give rise to any claim or liability brought by or on behalf of any
person acting within the definition of "aggressor" set forth in ILCS Chapter
720, Act 5, § 7-4, or the estate, spouse, or other family member of such a
person, against the person or estate of the person using such justified force,

(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-2) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-2)
§ 130.087 USE OF FORCE IN DEFENSE OF OTHER PROPERTY.
   (A)   A person is justified in the use of force against when and to the

interference with either real property, other than a dwelling, or personal
property, lawfully in his or her possession or in the possession of another who
is a member of his or her immediate family or household or of a person whose
property he or she has a legal duty to protect. However, he or she is justified
in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily
harm only if he or she reasonably believes that the force is necessary to
prevent the commission of a forcible felony.
   (B)   In no case shall any act involving the use of force justified under
this section give rise to any claim or liability brought by or on behalf of any
person acting within the definition of "aggressor" set forth in ILCS Chapter
720, Act 5, § 7-4, or the estate, spouse, or other family member of such a
person, against the person or estate of the person using such justified force,
unless the use of force involves willful or wanton misconduct.
(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-3) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-3)
§ 130.088 USE OF FORCE BY AGGRESSOR.

not available to a person who:
   (A)   Is attempting to commit, committing or escaping after the commission
of a forcible felony;
   (B)   Initially provokes the use of force against himself or herself, with
the intent to use the force as an excuse to inflict bodily harm upon the
assailant; or
   (C)   Otherwise initially provokes the use of force against himself or
herself unless:
      (1)   The force is so great that he or she reasonably believes that he or
she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he or she has
exhausted every reasonable means to escape the danger other than the use of
force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant; or
      (2)   In good faith, he or she withdraws from physical contact with the
assailant and indicated clearly to the assailant that he or she desires to
withdraw and terminate the use of force, but the assailant continues or resumes
the use of force.
(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-4) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-4)
§ 130.089 PEACE OFFICER’S USE OF FORCE IN MAKING ARREST.
   (A)   (1)   A peace officer, or any person whom he or she has summoned or
directed to assist him or her, need not retreat or desist from efforts to make
a lawful arrest because of resistance or threatened resistance to the arrest.
He or she is justified in the use of any force which he or she reasonably
believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to effect
the arrest and of any force which he or she reasonably believes, based on the
totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to defend himself, herself or
another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, he or she is
justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm only when
(i) he or she reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances,
that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself,
herself or such other person; (ii) or when he or she reasonably believes, based
on the totality of the circumstances, both that:
         (a)   Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest from being
defeated by resistance or escape and the officer reasonably believes that the
person to be arrested is likely to cause great bodily harm to another; and
         (b)   The person to be arrested committed or attempted a forcible
felony which involves the infliction or threatened infliction of great bodily
harm or is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon, or otherwise
indicates that he or she will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm
unless arrested without delay.
      (2)   As used in this division (A), RETREAT does not mean tactical
repositioning or other de-escalation tactics.
      (3)   A peace officer is not justified in using force likely to cause
death or great bodily harm when there is no longer an imminent threat of great
bodily harm to the officer or another.
      (4)   Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of force,
make reasonable efforts to identify himself or herself as a peace officer and
to warn that deadly force may be used.
      (5)   A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based
on the danger that the person poses to himself or herself if a reasonable
officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or
great bodily harm to the peace officer or to another person.
      (6)   A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person who is
suspected of committing a property offense, unless that offense is terrorism or
unless deadly force is otherwise authorized by law.
   (B)   A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to an invalid warrant is
justified in the use of any force which he or she would be justified in using
if the warrant were valid, unless he or she knows that the warrant is invalid.
   (C)   The authority to use physical force conferred on peace officers by
this section is a serious responsibility that shall be exercised judiciously
and with respect for human rights and dignity and for the sanctity of every
human life.
   (D)   Peace officers shall use deadly force only when reasonably necessary
in defense of human life. In determining whether deadly force is reasonably
necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the totality of
circumstances of each case including but not limited to the proximity in time
of the use of force to the commission of a forcible felony, and the reasonable
feasibility of safely apprehending a subject at a later time, and shall use
other available resources and techniques, if reasonably safe and feasible to a
reasonable officer.
   (E)   The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated
carefully and thoroughly, in a manner that reflects the gravity of that
authority and the serious consequences of the use of force by peace officers,
in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and agency
policies.
   (F)   The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from
the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the
totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time
of the decision, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and that the
totality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be
forced to make quick judgments about using force.
   (G)   Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to adopt and develop policies
designed to protect individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or
intellectual disabilities, or individuals who are significantly more likely to
experience greater levels of physical force during police interactions, as
these disabilities may affect the ability of a person to understand or comply
with commands from peace officers.
   (H)   As used in this section:
      (1)   DEADLY FORCE means any use of force that creates a substantial risk
of causing death or great bodily harm, including, but not limited to, the
discharge of a firearm;
      (2)   A threat of death or serious bodily injury is IMMINENT when, based
on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same
situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and
apparent intent to immediately cause death or great bodily harm to the peace
officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future
harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of
the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and
addressed;
      (3)   TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES means all facts known to the peace
officer at the time, or that would be known to a reasonable officer in the same
situation, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to
the use of deadly force.
(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-5) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-5)
§ 130.090 PRIVATE PERSON’S USE OF FORCE IN MAKING ARREST.
   (A)   A private person who makes or assists another private person in making
a lawful arrest is justified in the use of any force which he or she would be
justified in using if he or she were summoned or directed by a peace officer to
make the arrest, except that he or she is justified in the use of force likely
to cause death or great bodily harm only when he or she reasonably believes
that the force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or
herself or another.
   (B)   A private person who is summoned or directed by a peace officer to
assist in making an arrest which is unlawful, is justified in the use of any
force which he or she would be justified in using if the arrest were lawful
unless he or she knows that the arrest is unlawful.
(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-6) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-6)
§ 130.091 PRIVATE PERSON’S USE OF FORCE IN RESISTING ARREST.
   A person is not authorized to use force to resist an arrest which he or she
knows is being made either by a peace officer or by a private person summoned
and directed by a peace officer to make the arrest, even if he or she believes
that the arrest is unlawful and the arrest in fact is unlawful.

§ 130.093 USE OF FORCE TO PREVENT ESCAPE.
   (A)   A peace officer or other person who has an arrested person in his or
her custody is justified in the use of force, except deadly force, to prevent
the escape of the arrested person from custody as he or she would be justified
in using if he or she were arresting the person.
   (B)   A guard or other peace officer is justified in the use of force which
he or she reasonably believes necessary to prevent the escape from a penal
institution of a person whom the officer reasonably believes to be lawfully
detained in the institution under sentence for an offense or awaiting trail of
commitment for an offense.
   (C)   Deadly force shall not be used to prevent escape under this section
unless, based on the totality of the circumstances, deadly force is necessary
to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself, herself, or such other
person.

§ 130.094 EXECUTION OF DEATH SENTENCE.
   A public officer who, in the exercise of his or her official duty, puts a

§ 130.096 ENTRAPMENT.
   A person is not guilty of an offense if his or her conduct is incited or
induced by a public officer or employee or agent of either, for the purpose of
obtaining evidence for the prosecution of such person. However, this section is

officer or employee or agent of either merely affords to the person the
opportunity or facility for committing an offense in furtherance of a criminal
purpose which the person has originated.
(ILCS Chapter 720, Act 5, § 7-12) (1981 Code, § 42.07, 7-12)
§ 130.097 NECESSITY.
   Conduct which would otherwise be an offense is justifiable by reason of
necessity if the accused was without blame in occasioning or developing the

his or her own conduct.

THEFT AND RELATED OFFENSES
§ 131.15 THEFT GENERALLY.
   A person commits theft when he or she knowingly:
   (A)   Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner;
   (B)   Obtains, by deception, control over property of the owner;
   (C)   Obtains, by threat, control over property of the owner;
   (D)   Obtains control over stolen property knowing the property to have been
stolen by another or under the circumstances as would reasonably induce him or
her to believe that the property was stolen; or
   (E)   Obtains or exerts control over property in the custody of any law
enforcement agency which is explicitly represented to him or her by any law
enforcement officer or any individual acting in behalf of a law enforcement
agency as being stolen; and
      (1)   Intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of
the property;
      (2)   Knowingly uses, conceals or abandons the property knowing in such
manner as to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit; or
      (3)   Uses, conceals or abandons the property knowing the use,
concealment or abandonment probably will deprive the owner permanently of the
use or benefit.
   (F)   The theft of property not from the person and not exceeding $500 in
value is a Class A misdemeanor.
   (G)   Theft by lessee; permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer
evidence that a person intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or
benefit of the property:
      (1)   If a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it
to the owner within ten days after written demand from the owner for its
return; or
      (2)   If a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it
to the owner within 24 hours after written demand from the owner for its return
and the lessee had presented identification to the owner that contained a
materially fictitious name, address, or telephone number. A notice in writing,
given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, addressed and mailed, by
registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by him and shown on the
leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.
   (H)   Permissive inference; evidence of intent that a person obtains by
deception control over property. The trier of fact may infer that a person
"knowingly obtains by deception control over property of the owner" when he or
she fails to return, within 45 days after written demand from the owner, the
downpayment and any additional payments accepted under a promise, oral or in
writing, to perform services for the owner for consideration of $3,000 or more,
and the promisor knowingly without good cause failed to substantially perform
pursuant to the agreement after taking a down payment of 10% or more of the
agreed upon consideration. This provision shall not apply where the owner
initiated the suspension of performance under the agreement, or where the
promisor responds to the notice within the 45-day notice period. A notice in
writing, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the promisor at the last
known address of the promisor, shall constitute proper demand.
   (I)   Offender's interest in the property.
      (1)   It is no defense to a charge of theft of property that the offender
has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the
offender is not entitled.
      (2)   Where the property involved is that of the offender's spouse, no
prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living
together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the
alleged theft.

the property.

$500 in value, under an agreement in writing which provides for the return of
the vehicle, equipment, or other personal property to a particular place at a
particular time, he or she without good cause knowingly fails to return the
vehicle, equipment, or other personal property to that place within the time
specified, and is thereafter served or sent a written demand mailed to the last
known address, made by certified mail return receipt requested, to return the
vehicle, equipment, or other personal property within three days from the
mailing of the written demand, and who without good cause knowingly fails to
return the vehicle, equipment, or any other personal property to any place of
business of the lessor within the return period. The trier of fact may infer
evidence that the person is without good cause if the person signs the
agreement with a name or address other than his or her own.
   (C)   A person commits theft when he or she borrows from a library facility
library material which has an aggregate value of $50 or more pursuant to an
agreement with or procedure established by the library facility for the return
of such library material and knowingly without good cause fails to return the
library material so borrowed in accordance with such agreement or procedure,
and further knowingly without good cause fails to return such library material
within 30 days after receiving written notice by certified mail from the
library facility demanding the return of such library material.
   (D)   A person convicted of theft under this subsection (A) is guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor, except that the theft of library material where the
aggregate value exceeds $300 is a Class 3 felony. A person convicted of theft
under subsection (B) is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person convicted of theft
under subsection (C) is guilty of a petty offense for which the offender may be
fined an amount not to exceed $500 and shall be ordered to reimburse the
library for postage costs, attorney’s fees and actual replacement costs of the
materials not returned, except that theft under subsection (C) where the
aggregate value exceeds $300 is a Class 3 felony. For the purposes of
sentencing on theft of library material, separate transactions totalling more
than $300 within a 90-day period shall constitute a single offense.

VANDALISM
§ 131.50 BACKGROUND.
   Acts of vandalism resulting in damage to real or personal property within
the village have increased posing a threat to the value of property and the
welfare of residents. It is in the best interests of the village that the acts
be prosecuted by the village as a local offense; that penalties therefor be
imposed which are related to the nature of the act and the type of offender;
and that parents or legal guardians of minors found guilty of such acts be held
responsible for any monetary penalty or order of restitution or reparation
imposed. The diligent pursuit of the interests will tend to increase parental
supervision of minors and reduce the incidence of juvenile vandalism, thus
advancing the welfare of residents of the village.

standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;

ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;

of the material, or absence thereof;

or other promotion of the material;

   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement, or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

CANNABIS CONTROL ACT
§ 133.060 LEGISLATIVE DECLARATION.
   (A)   The Board of Trustees of the village recognize that:
      (1)   The current state of scientific and medical knowledge concerning
the effects of cannabis makes it necessary to acknowledge the physical,
psychological and sociological damage which is incumbent upon its use;
      (2)   The use of cannabis occupies the unusual position of being widely
used and pervasive among the citizens of Illinois despite its harmful effects;
and
      (3)   Previous legislation enacted to control or forbid the use of
cannabis has often unnecessarily and unrealistically drawn a large segment of
our population within the criminal justice system without succeeding in
deterring the expansion of cannabis use.
   (B)   It is therefore, the intent of the Board of Trustees of the village,
in the interest of the health and welfare of the citizens of the village, to
establish a reasonable penalty system which is responsive to the current state
of knowledge concerning cannabis and which directs the greatest efforts of law
enforcement towards the commercial traffickers.

   (A)   A building permit is required prior to the construction or
installation of any fence within the corporate limits of the village.
   (B)   Fences shall be constructed or installed according to the regulations
established as follows.
      (1)   Barbed-wire fences. No person shall erect any fence along any
street or alley or other public place within the village of which barbed wire
or any other sharp, pointed or dangerous material forms a part, without the
prior agreement of the Building Inspector.
      (2)   Dilapidated fences.
         (a)   Any fence within the village which has been permitted to become
and is sagging, dilapidated or fallen to the ground is hereby declared to be a
nuisance and unlawful for the owner thereof to maintain.
         (b)   Each day that a sagging, dilapidated or fallen fence is
permitted to exist, following the filing of a complaint against the owner by
the village, shall be considered a separate offense.
      (3)   Maximum height. Fences in a residential area shall be a maximum
height of six feet. The fence may be either solid as to block the passage of
light or open that light may pass between the ornamental or structural
components of the fences.
      (4)   Nonconforming structures. Fences, walls and shrubbery constructed
or planted prior to the date of the adoption of this chapter which do not
conform to the provisions of this chapter shall be considered legal
nonconforming structures. An existing fence or wall may be maintained, repaired
or structurally altered; however, no repair or structural alteration shall
create an additional nonconformity or increase the degree of nonconformity. In
the event a fence or wall is damaged or destroyed to the extent that the cost
or restoration shall exceed 50% of the cost of a new fence or wall, no repairs
or reconstruction shall be made unless the restoration or construction shall
thereafter conform to the regulations in this chapter. If the damage or
destruction does not exceed 50% of the market value of the fence or wall,
repairs and restoration shall be completed within 12 months from the date of
damage or destruction or the restoration shall conform to the regulations of
this chapter.
      (5)   Location, design and construction.

adjacent to the public right-of-way shall be considered a corner side yard and
shall be regulated as a front yard with a maximum fence height of three feet. A
gate opening shall be required if the front yard fence creates a wholly
enclosed area and adjoins a street right-of-way to provide access to the right-
of-way. All other front yard fences shall be prohibited.
         (b)   All fences must be constructed within the confines of the
property for which the permit is sought and no fence shall exceed six feet in
height except as provided in Chapter 157 of this code of ordinances or herein.
This section shall not apply to limit the height of solid fences, screens or
walls around patios as set forth herein. The Building Inspector may refuse to
issue a permit for any fence which, in his or her judgment, serves no
ornamental or useful purpose or imposes an unreasonable hardship on adjoining
property owners.
         (c)   A fence, including all posts, bases and other structural parts
shall be located completely within the boundaries of the lot on which it is
located. No fence shall be located closer than 12 inches to a public sidewalk
or public right-of-way.
         (d)   All fences shall be constructed with the finished surface facing
neighboring property with support posts placed to the inside, except in cases
where the posts are an integral part of the fence design which enhances the
aesthetic appearance of the fence.
         (e)   No fence, wall or shrubbery shall exceed a maximum of two feet
above the grade of the adjoining public right-of-way within the sight line
triangle, which is defined as a triangular shaped portion of land established
at street intersections within 25 feet of the intersection, in which nothing is
erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in a manner as to limit or obstruct
the sight distance of motorists entering or leaving the intersection. The
purpose of this requirement is to provide for visual clearance and traffic
safety.

or across a drainage easement provided that the bottom of the fence has a
vertical clearance of not less than eight inches or a greater clearance as may

Village Engineer. The vertical clearance shall be maintained for the entire
length of that portion of the fence that is installed in or across the drainage
easement.
      (7)   Responsibility of owners and occupants; exemptions.
         (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or occupant of
the property where a fence or wall is erected to maintain the structure in good
repair at all times. If a fence or wall is found to be in a deteriorated
condition and/or in need of repair, including, but not limited to broken or
missing structural components and/or the fence is substantially less than
perpendicular to grade, the Building Enforcement Officer or his or her
authorized agent may order the fencing to be repaired, replaced or removed
depending on the condition of the fence. The order shall be in writing.
         (b)   The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to fences,
walls or shrubbery owned or maintained by the village or to fences constructed
or maintained by any other governmental body or agency for which the principal
purpose is inherent to public safety.
      (8)   Limitations. Except as expressly permitted in division (B)(5)(a) of
this section, no fence shall be erected which shall extend beyond the front
building line of the house. All fences must be constructed within the confines
of the property for which the permit is sought and no fence shall exceed six

minimum and maximum height. In addition, this section shall not apply to limit
the height of solid fences, screens or walls around patios as set forth herein.
All fences shall maintain a minimum three feet distance from any neighboring
structures including a neighboring fence. In addition, the Building Inspector
is authorized and empowered to refuse permit for any fence which apparently
serves no ornamental or useful purpose and imposes on unreasonable hardships on
an adjoining property owner.
      (9)   Patio fences, screen or walls. In residential areas, solid fences,
screens or walls may be erected around the immediate boundaries of patios for
the purpose of securing privacy, provided they do not exceed seven feet in
height and are located not less than three feet from a lot line.
      (10)   Fence permits. No fence, screen or wall shall be erected without
first securing a permit from the Building Inspector. The fee for a fence permit
shall be as established in the annual fee schedule.
      (11)   Support posts. Fences must be erected so that the posts and all
other supporting members face to the owners side. The rough part of the frame
shall face the owner’s property.
   (C)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the jurisdiction to hold public
hearings and offer recommendations to the Village Board of Trustees concerning
variations of this section pursuant to its powers granted by, and in accordance
with the procedures in Chapter 157 of this Code. The Village Board of Trustees
may grant variations from this section after a public hearing is held by the
Zoning Board of Appeals and upon receipt of a recommendation from the Zoning
Board of Appeals.

§ 152.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACT. An “Act in Relation to the Regulation of the Rivers, Lakes and Streams
of the State of Illinois.”
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
   APPROPRIATE USE. Only uses of the regulatory floodway that are permissible
and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed
are as specified in §
152.06(C).
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a one-percent probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR
FREQUENCY FLOOD EVENT. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in §
152.05.
   BUILDING. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more
than 180 days.
   CHANNEL. Any river, strewn, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash or natural or man-made drainage way, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION. Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION includes
damming, riprapping or other armoring, widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody vegetation.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation,
debris or trash from the channel. CHANNELIZATION is a severe form of channel
modification involving a typically involving relocation of the existing channel
(such as straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the flood
plain. The uncompensated loss of natural flood plain storage can increase off-
site floodwater elevations and flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A REGULATORY FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE.  Preconstruction
approval by DWR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of a proposed
change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval pursuant to this
part, gives assurances to the property owner that once an appropriate use is
constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as
previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as-built plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION or CLOMR. A letter which indicates that
the Federal Emergency Management Agency will revise base flood elevations,
flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an
effective flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map, once the as-
built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.

elevations at or below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood
elevation. FLOOD PLAINS may also include detached Special Flood Hazard Areas,
ponding areas, etc. The FLOOD PLAIN is also known as the SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD
AREA or SFHA. The FLOOD PLAINS are those lands within the jurisdiction of the
village that are subject to inundation by the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood. The SFHAs of the village are generally identified as such on the Kane
County and Cook County Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Maps prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency are generally identified as such on the
following map number 17089C panels 0156, 0157, and 0159 dated December 20,
2002, and panel 0180 dated November 16, 2006.

existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by humans. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its flood plain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross-section of the
stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some
natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is re-
established. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural
conditions by humans through regrading and re-vegetation.
   ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK or OHWM. The point on the bank or shore up to which
the presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave a
distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial

due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10% increase
in velocities. The REGULATORY FLOODWAYS are designated for the Fox River in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) maps dated December 20, 2002 and November 16, 2006
with corresponding profiles in the FIS prepared by FEMA.
      (2)   The REGULATORY FLOODWAYS for those parts of unincorporated Kane and
Cook Counties that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village
that may be annexed into the village are designated on the flood boundary and
floodway map prepared by FEMA for Kane County dated December 20, 2002 and
November 16, 2006, and Cook County dated December 20, 2002 and November 16,
2006. To locate the regulatory floodway boundary on any site, the regulatory
floodway boundary should be scaled off the regulatory floodway map and located
on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation
is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory floodway boundary,
the DWR should be contacted for the interpretation.

   (A)   The Building Inspector shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the
duties listed in §
152.03.
   (B)   To fulfill those duties, the Building Inspector first should use the
criteria listed in §
152.05 to determine whether the development site is located within a flood
plain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a flood plain,
the Building Inspector must determine whether the development site is within a
flood fringe, a regulatory floodway or within a SFHA or flood plain on which no
floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the
Building Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of §
152.06(A) be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Village Engineer and
Building Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of §
152.06(B) be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or flood plain for which
no detailed study has been completed and approved, the Village Engineer and
Building Inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of §
152.06(C) be met.
   (C)   In addition, the general requirements of §
152.07 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of §
152.06. The Village Engineer and Building Inspector shall assure that all
subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of §
152.08.
   (D)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Village Engineer
and Building Inspector shall review the requirements of §
152.09 to make sure they are met. In addition, the Building Inspector shall
complete all notification requirements.
   (E)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the Building Inspector may take any and all actions as outlined
in §
152.99.
   (F)   The fees for soil erosion permits shall be as adopted in the annual
fee schedule.

§ 152.05 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   (A)   This chapter’s protection standard is based on the flood insurance
study for the village.
   (B)   If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not
available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available in the State Water Survey’s Flood
Plain Information Repository.
   (C)   When a party disagrees with the best available data, he or she may
finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to DWR and FEMA.
      (1)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs
of Fox River shall be delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
Countywide Flood Insurance Study for Kane County prepared by FEMA and dated
November 16, 2006 and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared
from time to time.
      (2)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs
of those parts of unincorporated Kane and Cook Counties that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village that may be annexed into the
village shall be delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide
Flood Insurance Study for Kane and Cook Counties prepared by FEMA for Kane
County dated December 20, 2002 and November 16, 2006, and Cook County dated
December 20, 2002 and November 16, 2006 and such amendments to such study and
maps as may be prepared from time to time.
      (3)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation f or each SFHA
delineated as an “AH Zone” or “AO Zone” shall be that elevation or depth
delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the village.
      (4)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of
the remaining SFHAs delineated as an “A Zone” on the flood insurance rate map
of the village shall be according to the best existing data available to the
Illinois State Water Survey Flood Plain Information Repository. When no base
flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from
a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2 or a dynamic model, such as HIP. The
flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic
model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, HIP or by techniques presented in various
publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating
peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land
use conditions in the watershed, as determined from adopted local and regional
land use plans, along any watercourses draining more than one square mile.
Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses
shall be submitted to DWR for approval; once approved, it must be submitted to
the State Water Survey Flood Plain Information Repository for filing. For a
non-riverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of
record, plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and
approved by the Illinois State Water Survey.
(1981 Code, § 30.05) (Ord. 90-5, passed - -; Am. Ord. 06-53, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 152.06 OCCUPATION AND USE.
   (A)   (1)   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be
permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood by proper elevation and compensatory storage and other
provisions of this chapter are met. No use will be permitted which adversely
affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems.
      (2)   Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the
requirements of this section, along with the requirements of §
152.07.
         (a)   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted
by state law shall commerce any development in the SFHA without first obtaining
a development permit from the Building Official.
         (b)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the village. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of
the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal
description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or
land surveyor; existing grade elevations in M - S.L. 1929 adj. datum or
N.G.V.D. and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the
location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all
proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, and
lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development
will be subject to the requirements of §
152.07.
         (c)   Upon receipt of any development permit application, the Building
Official shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to
have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the date of the site’s
first flood insurance rate map identification is not located in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The Building
official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to
the date of the site’s first flood insurance rate map identification.
         (d)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed
areas shall be submitted.
            1.   This plan shall include a description of the sequence of
grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to
be implemented to mitigate their effects.
            2.   This plan shall also include a description of final
stablization and revegetation measures and the identification of a responsible
party to ensure post construction maintenance.
         (e)   The Building Official shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals
or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of
development activity. The Building Official shall not issue a permit unless all
other local, state and federal permits have been obtained.
         (f)   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to
public health and safety.
         (g)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient
data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of
removing the site from the flood plain.
         (h)   Whenever any portion of a flood plain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation
volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half times the volume of storage
lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, the
excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or
occupied. All flood plain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
flood plain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavation shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
(1981 Code, § 30.06)
   (B)   (1)   This section applies to proposed development, redevelopment,

               e.   A copy of the regulatory floodway map, marked to reflect
any proposed change in the regulatory floodway location.
            13.   Any and all other local, state and federal permits or
approval letters that may be required for this type of development;
            14.   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be

division (B);
            15.   If the regulatory floodway delineation, base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation will change due to the proposed project, the
application will not be considered complete until DWR has indicated conditional
approval of the regulatory floodway map change; (No structures may be built
until a letter of map revision has been approved by FEMA.)
            16.   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions and
existing ground elevations and all changes in grade resulting from any proposed
excavation or filling and flood plain and floodway limits; sealed by a
registered professional engineer, licensed architect or registered land
surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of §
152.07;
            17.   If the proposed project involves a channel modification, the

         (c)   The Building Inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits and
approvals that may be required for this type of activity. The Building
Inspector shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal
and state permits have been obtained. A registered professional engineer, under
the employ or contract of the village shall review and approve applications
reviewed under this section.
         (d)   The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or
impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or
channel or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in applicable
Illinois Administrative Code regulations will be allowed. Appropriate uses do
not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to
accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing, including
landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence, and storage of materials,
except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The approved
appropriate uses are as follows:
            1.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works
or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion
or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
            2.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
            3.   Storm and sanitary sewer out falls;
            4.   Underground and overhead utilities;
            5.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows and including
open air pavilions;
            6.   Detached garages, storage sheds or other non-habitable
accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will
not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage;
            7.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
            8.   Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of
flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.01) and
aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation;
            9.   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse;
            10.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing
lawful structures including the construction of water tight window wells,
elevating structures or construction of floodwalls around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the
floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the
existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to
the structure;
            11.   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings,
reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50%
of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced and which
do not increase the outside dimensions of the building; and
            12.   Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not
increase the buildings footprint and are valued at less than 50% of the market
value of the building.
         (e)   Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory
floodway maps designated by DWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will
be considered permissible; provided that, the proposed project meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated, in writing,
with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional
engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of §
152.07:
            1.   For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
               a.   Regulatory floodway conveyance:
2/3
“K”     1.486 AR
n
                  i.   n is Manning’s Toughness factor;
                  ii.   A is the effective area of the cross-section; and
                  iii.   R is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.
               b.   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both
existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a
federal, state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions
will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-
vegetative land cover.
               c.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer
can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
                  i.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length.
                  ii.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length.
                  iii.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used.
                  iv.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
                  v.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
            2.   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be at least equal to one and
one-half times the volume of flood plain storage lost. Artificially created
storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be
required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be
placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year
flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-
year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood
elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of
the proposed construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate to DWR
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be
no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification
unless the modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
            3.   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or oil
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case of
bridges or culverts or oil stream structures built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if soil erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
            4.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the un-stream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements. If the flood stage is greater than 0.1 feet,
the developer must contact DWR, Dam Safety Section, for a dam safety permit or
waiver.
               a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
all water conditions for the flood study specified in §
152.05. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for
the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/
Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation
procedures.
               b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per this
division (B).
               c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per this division (B).
               d.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is
used for recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of Transportation
permit must be received.
               e.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this division
(B).
               f.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed per this division (B).
            5.   a.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction
or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
               b.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream flood plain,
the applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
               c.   The determination as to whether or not the existing
crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared
in accordance with applicable Illinois Administrative Code regulations and
submitted to the Division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
            6.   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero foot
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within
recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not
required must be obtained from DWR, Dam Safety Section, for a dam safety permit
or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures, as
defined § 152.02, shall meet the permitting requirements of applicable Illinois
Administrative Code regulations. If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
               a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention;
               b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions; (Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation
basin.)
               d.   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants;
and (If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.)
               e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
this division (B).
            7.   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of
the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
            8.   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The
following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s
engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that
more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length;
               b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length;
               c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used; and
               d.   Erosion /scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
            9.   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it
shall be demonstrated that:
               a.   There are not practicable alternatives to the activity
which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions
of the body of water affected; (Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures
from the flood plain, clearing the channel, high flow channel or the
establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification
is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water
quality and fish and wildlife habitat.)
               b.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resources values;
               c.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria.
                  i.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel
shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length,
cross-section slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
                  ii.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided
at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that
they will prevent erosion.
                  iii.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of stream side, riparian vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stablization
effects of the vegetation.
                  iv.   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which
is essential for construction of the channel.
                  v.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stablization measures, natural rock or rip rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are not practicable alternatives.
                  vi.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification
shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
                  vii.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features
shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and testing areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established where
appropriate.
                  viii.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream
end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream
water quality.
                  ix.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry
season and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed
prior to diversion of water into the new channel.
                  x.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
                  xi.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
                  xii.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements
of this division (B).
            10.   For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and
stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
            11.   For all activities in the floodway, including grading,
filling and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed
soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed
consistent with the following criteria:
               a.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the
initiation of improvements.
               b.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be
applied to eroded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization
shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of
the site and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade,
but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.
               c.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before
any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the
movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment
control devices include filter, fences, straw bale fences, check dams,
diversion ditches and sediment basins.
               d.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall
be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels.
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream
crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary
construction in or along channels shall be re-stabilized immediately.
               e.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with “Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation, Control in Illinois,” (1988) also known as the
“Green Book” and “Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control,” (IEPA, 1987).
            12.   For public flood control projects, the permitting
requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can
demonstrate to DWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the
proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood
heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up
to and including the 100-year frequency event.
            13.   a.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the
regulatory floodway study, referenced in §
152.05, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, DWR shall be contacted for
approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
               b.   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site
of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream
receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall
be shown to meet with requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency
flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
               c.   If the applicant learns from DWR, local governments or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
            14.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to DWR and to FEMA all the information calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway change
before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not
be changed by DWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and
accepted by FEMA and DWR. In the case of non-government projects, the
municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall
concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before
DWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall
take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development
activities shall take place until a final LOMR is issued by FEMA and DWR.
            15.   All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the
supervision of a registered professional engineer.
            16.   For all activities in the floodway involving construction
within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
               a.   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within
at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mask of the channel.
               b.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during
the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
               c.   The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the
buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when
necessary, for stream maintenance purposes.
               d.   After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory
floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map
revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway
designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction
that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory
floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The
regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DWR
and FEMA of the “as-built” plans.
         (f)   For those projects listed below located in a regulatory
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DWR for their review and
concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
            1.   DWR will review an engineer’s analysis of the flood profile
due to a proposed bridge pursuant to this division (B).
            2.   DWR will review an engineer’s determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to this division (B).
            3.   The DWR will review alternative transition sections and
hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to this division (B).
            4.   The DWR will review and approve prior to the start of
construction any Department projects, dams and all other state, federal or
local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or
county.
         (g)   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from DWR, issued pursuant to state statutes. No permit from DWR
shall be required if the Division has delegated this responsibility to the
village.
         (h)   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of
a dam, per applicable Illinois Administrative Code regulations, shall obtain an
Illinois Division of Water Resources dam safety permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam. If the Building inspector finds a dam that does not have
a DWR permit, the Building Inspector shall immediately notify the Dam Safety
Section of the Division of Water Resources. If the Building Inspector finds a
dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Building Inspector shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam, DWR, Dam Safety Section, in
Springfield and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).
         (i)   The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer’s review. The activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
            1.   Underground and overhead utilities that:
               a.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground
elevations;
               b.   Do not require the placement of above ground structures in
the floodway;
               c.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream
bed; and
               d.   In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are
placed in the watercourse and are designed in a fashion as not to catch debris.
            2.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
               a.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing
adjacent natural bank slope;
               b.   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
               c.   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the
outfall location.
            3.   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields, excluding fences,
properly anchored
playground equipment and patios at grade;
            4.   Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection that:
               a.   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length;
               b.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of
bank;
               c.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-
sectional areas of the stream channel or bank of the lake; and
               d.   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the
preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
            5.   Temporary stream crossings in which:
               a.   The approach road will be one and one-half feet or less
above natural grade;
               b.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing
up the water above the steam bank vegetation line or above, any drainage tile
or outfall invert;
               c.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least
two feet below the top of the lowest bank; (Any fill in the channel shall be
non-erosive material, such as riprap or gravel.)
               d.   All disturbed steam banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction; and
               e.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed
within one year after authorization.
(1981 Code, § 30.07)
   (C)   (1)   In SFHA or flood plains, where no floodways have been identified
and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established
by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be
permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly
impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly
increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
      (2)   No person firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by
state law, shall commerce any development in a SFHA or flood plain without
first obtaining a development permit from the Building Inspector.
      (3)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Building Inspector. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions and
existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevator at the
lowest floor, including basement, of all proposed buildings subject to the
requirements of §
152.07.
      (4)   The application for a development permit shall also include the
following information:
         (a)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose and
intended use;
         (b)   Site location, including legal description, of the property,
drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is
proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
         (c)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity; and
         (d)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include
as a minimum:
            1.   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale and north arrow;
            2.   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing
existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or
N.G.V.D, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the
proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), flood

identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.)
            5.   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be
submitted showing that the proposed work will meet criteria hereof;
            6.   Any and all local, state and federal permits or approvals that
may be required for this type of development;
            7.   Based on the best available existing data according to the
Illinois State Water Survey’s Flood Plain Information Repository, the Building
Inspector shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation; (Should no elevation information exist for the site,
the developer’s engineer shall calculate the elevation according to §
152.05. Any development located on land that call be shown to have been higher
than the base flood elevation as of the sites first flood insurance rate map
identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the
requirements of this chapter. The Building Official shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site’s first flood insurance rate map identification.)
            8.   The Building Inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals
or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity;
(The Building Inspector shall not issue the development permit unless all
required local, state and federal permits have been obtained.)
            9.   No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been
determined shall create a damaging or potentially increase in flood heights or
velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural
hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair
existing water quality or aquatic habitat; (Construction impacts shall be
minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter.)
            10.   Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been
determined, the following standards shall apply:
               a.   The developer shall have a registered professional engineer
state, in writing, and show through supporting plans, calculations and data
that the project meets the engineering requirements of division (B) above for
the entire flood plain as calculated under the provisions of §
152.05. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study
performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to DWR for
acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by the
Department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the
requirements of division (B) above for the regulatory floodway. The floodway
shall be defined according to the definition in §
152.02.
               b.   A development permit shall not be issued unless the
applicant first obtains a permit from DWR or written documentation that a
permit is not required from DWR.
               c.   No permit from DWR shall be required if the Division has
delegated permit responsibility to the village per applicable Illinois
Administrative Code regulations for regulatory floodways, per DWR statewide
permit entitled “Construction in Flood Plains with No Designated Floodways in
Northeastern Illinois.”
               d.   Any work involving the construction, modification or
removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water, as defined in §
152.02, shall obtain an Illinois Division of Water Resources dam safety permit
or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of
construction of a dam. If the Building Inspector finds a dam that does not have
a DWR permit, the Building Inspector shall immediately notify the Dam Safety
Section of the Division of Water Resources. If the Building Inspector finds a
dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Building Inspector shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois Emergency Services and
Disaster Agency (ESDA) and the DWR, Dam Safety Section in Springfield.
               e.   The following activities may be permitted without a
registered professional engineer’s review or calculation of a base flood
elevation and regulatory floodway. The activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter:
                  i.   Underground and overhead utilities that:
                     A.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground
elevations;
                     B.   Do not require above ground structures in the
floodway;
                     C.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top
of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing
stream bed; and
                     D.   In the case of overhead utilities, supporting towers
are not placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to
catch debris.
                  ii.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
                     A.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing
adjacent natural bank slope;
                     B.   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
                     C.   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the
outfall location.
                  iii.   Construction of shoreline and streambed protection
that:
                     A.   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length or two cubic
yards per lineal foot of steambed;
                     B.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top
of bank;
                     C.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-
sectional area of the stream channel by more than 10%; and
                     D.   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are
the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high
channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
                  iv.   Temporary stream crossing in which:
                     A.   The approach roads will be one-half foot or less
above natural grade;
                     B.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without
backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any
drainage tile or outfall invert;
                     C.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at
least two feet below the top of the lowest batik; (Any fill in the channel
shall be nonerosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel.)

structures such as playground equipment, pavilions and carports built at or
below existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of flood waters;
                  viii.   The placement of properly anchored buildings not
exceeding 70 square feet in size, nor ten feet in any dimension (such as animal
shelters and tool sheds);
                  xi.   The construction of additions to existing buildings
which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20%, which are located
on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building and which do not
extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow
of flood waters; and
                  x.   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
                     A.   The affected length of stream is less than 1,000
feet;
                     B.   The work is confined to re-establishing flows in
natural stream channels; or
                     C.   The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel
conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site.
               f.   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
            11.   Whenever any portion of a flood plain is authorized for use,
the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation
volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half times the volume of storage
lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, the
excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or
occupied. All flood plain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
flood plain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.)
   (E)   All buildings located within a 100-year flood plain also known as a
SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation.
However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also
meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in § 152.06(B).
This building protection requirement applies to the following situations:
      (1)   Construction or placement of a new building;
      (2)   Structural alteration to an existing building that increase the
floor area by more than 20% or the market value by more than 50%;
      (3)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply
to returning a manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before
it was removed to avoid flood damage;
      (4)   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days; and
      (5)   This building protection requirement may be met by one of the

constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The lowest floor, including basement, shall be at or above the
flood protection elevation.
      (2)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of
the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of
the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the ten-foot
minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method
to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill
shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely
effect the flow or surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
   (G)   A residential or non-residential building may be elevated in
accordance with the following:
      (1)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space,
walls, stilts, piles or other foundation that is permanently open to flood
waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or
100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than one foot
above grade, and consists of a minimum of two openings. The openings must have
a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation.
      (2)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned
in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure
to known hydrodyamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating debris.

being tied down in accordance with the rules and regulations for the Illinois
Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to 77 Ill. Adm. Code 870.
   (H)   Only a non-residential building may be structurally dry floodproofed,
in lieu of elevation; provided that, a registered professional engineer shall
certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the
flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility facilities are
watertight and capable of resisting the affects of the base flood or 100-year
frequency food; and (The building design shall take into account flood
velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodyamic forces, the
effects of buoyancy and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures
shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of
electricity, Levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered
floodproofing for the purpose of this division.)
   (I)   Non-conforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain
in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A non-
conforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or man-made
disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50% of its market value
before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this chapter.
(1981 Code, § 30.09) (Ord. 90-5, passed - -)
§ 152.08 OTHER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.

trailer parks, planned unit developments and additions to manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this information is not
available from an existing study filed with the Illinois State Water Survey,
the applicant’s engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation, per §
152.05, and the floodway delineation, per the definition in §
152.02, and submitting it to the state water survey for review and approval as
best available regulatory data.
   (C)   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located
and laid out in a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and
channels. Wherever possible, the flood plains shall be included within parks or
other public grounds.
   (D)   The Village Board shall not approve any PUD or plat of subdivision
located outside the corporate limits unless the agreement or plat is in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(1981 Code, § 30.10) (Ord. 90-5, passed - -)
§ 152.09 VARIANCES.
   (A)   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a
regulatory floodway, as defined in §
152.02.
   (B)   However, when a development proposal is located outside of a
regulatory floodway and whenever the standards of this chapter place undue
hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the
Zoning Board of Appeals for a variance.
   (C)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the applicant’s request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Village Board.
      (1)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that:

character of the area involved including existing stream uses.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant, in writing,
that a variance from the requirements of §
152.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
         (a)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
         (b)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
         (c)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that he or she will acknowledge, in writing, the assumption that he or she
assumes the risk and liability.
      (3)   Variances requested in connection with the restoration of a site or
building listed on the National Register of Historic Places or documented as
worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be
granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of divisions (C)
(1) and (2) above.
(1981 Code, § 30.11) (Ord. 90-5, passed - -)
§ 152.10 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the SFHA
will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on
the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
(1981 Code, § 30.12) (Ord. 90-5, passed - -)
§ 152.11 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This chapter
is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to
meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not intended to
repeal the resolution which the village passed in order to establish initial
eligibility for the program.
(1981 Code, § 30.14) (Ord. 90-5, passed - -)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a
variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter.

violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exist.
   (C)   The Village Attorney shall identify the owner, in writing, of the
violation.
   (D)   (1)   If the owner fails, after ten days notice, to correct the
violation.
         (a)   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make other order as the
court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
         (b)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than $50 or more than $1,000 for each offense.
         (c)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day
during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
         (d)   The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
      (2)   The Village Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages, and therefore, may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

if it results in a slope of two and one-half to one or greater along adjacent
lot lines, except where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and
erosion. Where cuts or fills are required to provide a building site,
engineering data must be presented to show existing and proposed topography,
location of the building site and an analysis of the fill material to be used.
      (5)   The maximum grade on driveways shall not exceed 12%. Each drive
shall provide sufficient space and distance to turn around before entering the

         (g)   Apartment buildings: 3,000 to 4,000 gpm.
      (3)   The minimum residual pressure in the proposed system shall be 20
psi during a fire flow event. The Village Engineer will furnish the expected
static pressure at the point of connection(s).
   (G)   Minimum size of water mains. Minimum size of water mains shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Detached single-family residential area: six inch diameter with
interconnecting loops of eight inches in diameter or larger.
      (2)   Other than detached single-family residential developments,
including town/row houses and apartment buildings: minimum eight inches in
diameter water mains with interconnecting mains of eight inches or larger
diameter.
      (3)   Other uses, excepting for small isolated developments: minimum size
water mains shall be ten inches in diameter.
   (H)   Valves. Valves shall be located so as to effectively isolate system
with minimum disruption. The following guides shall be considered.
      (1)   Valves shall be installed so that not over 500 to 700 feet of main
will be shut off at any given time.
      (2)   Where a “tee” is installed, at least two valves will be utilized.
Their location will be based upon location of other valves in the system.
      (3)   Where a “cross” is installed, at lease three valves will be
utilized. The valves shall be located with relation to other valves in the
system.
   (I)   Gridiron or looping. Gridiron or looping shall be as follows:

   (J)   Fire hydrant location. Fire hydrant installation for all areas,
including buildings set back from public water supplies, shall be as follows:
      (1)   Fire hydrants shall be installed along public streets or easements
so that no portion of a building will be over 300 feet from a public fire
hydrant. In general, linear hydrant spacing will not exceed 350 feet in single-
family areas, nor 300 feet elsewhere.
      (2)   Hydrant location will be so that:
         (a)   No portion of the building will be over 300 feet from a fire
hydrant;
         (b)   In addition to other requirements, the fire flow divided by 750
equals the number of hydrants necessary within 500 feet of a building; and
         (c)   A flow of 1,000 gpm from each fire hydrant will be provided.
      (3)   Hydrants shall be located so that:
         (a)   Hydrants shall be located approximately ten feet from an all-
weather roadway;
         (b)   Hydrants shall be located approximately 50 feet from the
buildings, if practical; and
         (c)   Access to hydrants shall be by all-weather routes adequate in
width, clearance and strength for all units. The routes shall be maintained
during all seasons of the year.
(1981 Code, § 22.311) (Ord. 88-15, passed 11-7-1988)
§ 155.056 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY ADJACENT TO WATER.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      DEVELOPMENT. The carrying out of any building, agricultural or mining
operation, or the making of any change in the use or appearance of land, and
the dividing of land into two or more parcels. The following activities or uses
shall be taken for the purposes of this section to involve DEVELOPMENT, as
defined herein:
         (a)   Any construction, reconstruction or alteration of a structure to
occupy more or less ground area or the on-site preparation for same;
         (b)   Any change in the intensity of use of land, such as an increase
in the number of dwelling units on land, or a material increase in the site
coverage of businesses, manufacturing establishments, offices and dwelling
units, including mobile homes, campers and recreational vehicles on land;
         (c)   The commencement of drilling, except to obtain soil samples or
the commencement of mining, filling, excavation, dredging, grading or other
alterations of the topography;
         (d)   Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site;
         (e)   Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction for agricultural,
private residential, commercial or industrial use;
         (f)   Deposit or refuse, solid or liquid waste or fill on a parcel of
land or the storage of materials;
         (g)   Construction, excavation or fill operations relating to the
creation or modification of any road, street, parking facility or any drainage
canal or to the installation of utilities or any other grading activity that
alters the existing topography;
         (h)   Construction or erection of dams, levees, walls, fences, bridges
or culverts; and
         (i)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK or OHWM. The point on the bank or shore up to
which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave
a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized
characteristics.
      SETBACK. The horizontal distance between any portion of a structure or
any development activity and the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or
intermittent stream, the ordinary high water mark of a lake or pond or the edge
of a wetland, measured from the structures or development’s closest point to
the ordinary high water mark or edge.
      STREAM. A body of running water flowing continuously or intermittently in
a channel on or below the surface of the ground. Minute topographic maps of the
U.S. Geological survey are one reference for identifying perennial and
intermittent streams. For purposes of this section, the term STREAM does not
include storm sewers.
   (B)   (1)   No development activity, except as provided below, may occur
within the minimum setback which is defined as 75 feet from the ordinary high
water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, the edge of wetlands or within a
designated depressional area. In no case shall the setback be less than the
boundary of the 100-year floodway, as defined by FEMA. These setback
requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken
out of the culvert as part of development activity. If a culvert functions as a
low-flow culvert where water is intended to periodically flow over it, the
setback requirements apply.
      (2)   Development activities may be permitted subject to the
establishment of easements, covenants or restrictions running with the land as
may be determined to be appropriate by the Village Board within the minimum
setback areas if, as a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the
setback area or it is found that the development activity is in the public
interest. The development activities will only be approved based upon the
evidence as the Village Engineer may specify which may, but need not
necessarily include a report, prepared by a qualified professional, which
demonstrates that they will not adversely affect water quality, destroy, damage
or disrupt significant habitat area; adversely affect drainage and/or
stormwater retention capabilities; adversely affect flood conveyance and
storage; lead to unstable earth conditions, create erosion hazards or be
materially detrimental to any other property in the area of the subject
property or to the village as a whole, including the loss of open space or
scenic vistas.
      (3)   An applicant for the development approval must stabilize areas left
exposed after land surface modification with vegetation normally associated
with that stream or wetland. The planting of native riparian vegetation is
recommended as the preferred stabilization measure. Other techniques should be
used only when and where vegetation fails to control erosion. The preferred
alternative is riprap, using natural rock materials where practicable,
installed on eroding bank areas in a manner that provides interstitial space
for vegetative growth and habitat for macro invertebrates and other stream
organisms. Lining of the stream channel bottom is not permitted.
   (C)   A site development plan must be prepared for any proposed development
within, or partly within, the minimum 75-foot setback and should indicate, if
applicable:
      (1)   Dimension and area of parcel showing also the vicinity of the site
in sufficient detail to enable easy location in the field of the site for which
development permission is sought, and including the boundary line, underlying
zoning, a legend, a scale and a north arrow; (This requirement may be satisfied
by the submission of a separate vicinity map.)
      (2)   Location of any existing and proposed structures;
      (3)   Location of existing or proposed on-site sewage systems or private
water supply systems;
      (4)   Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond and
its ordinary high water mark;
      (5)   Location and landward limit of all wetlands;
      (6)   Location of setback lines, as defined in this section;
      (7)   Location of the 100-year floodway;
      (8)   Location of existing or future access roads;
      (9)   Specifications and dimensions of stream, wetland or other water
areas proposed for alterations;
      (10)   Cross-sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood
storage volumes; and
      (11)   Other information as reasonably requested by the village.

DEDICATION OF LANDS
§ 155.070 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION.
   (A)   (1)   The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision
or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land
required to be dedicated for school sites.
      (2)   The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining
the ratio of: (1) estimated children to be served in each classification over
the (2) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each school
classification as stated herein, and then applying the ratio to the (3) minimum
recommended number of acres for a school site of each school classification as
stated herein.
      (3)   The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to
have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children
in each school classification.
   (B)   School classifications and size of school sites within the village
shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
 
School Classification by Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number of Acres of
Grades                   for Each School            Land for Each School
                         Classification             Classification
Elementary Schools
Grades: Kindergarten     670                        15
through Fifth (K - 5)
Junior High Schools
Grades: Sixth through    850                        25
Eighth (6 - 8)
High Schools
Grades: Ninth through    1,500                      70
Twelfth (9 - 12)
 
   (C)   The official plan of the village and the standards of the affected
school district shall be used as guidelines in locating sites.
(1981 Code, § 22.401) (Ord. 88-15, passed 11-7-1988; Am. Ord. 04-33, passed 9-
20-2004)
§ 155.071 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK AND RECREATION LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly
upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be
six acres of land per 1,000 of the ultimate population in accordance with the
following standards by types of recreation and park areas:
 
Types of Recreation Areas Size Range                Minimum Acres per 1,000
                                                    Population
Play lot                  Minimum 8,000 square feet NA
Neighborhood park         Minimum 3.5 acres         1.0
School park or            Minimum six acres         1.5
neighborhood playground
Community wide recreation Minimum 12 acres          1.5
park
District-township wide    Minimum 15 acres          2.0
park
TOTAL                                               6.0 acres of land per 1,000
                                                    people
 
   (B)   The official plan of the village and any plans and standards adopted
by the affected park district shall be used as guidelines for locating sites. A
park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than five acres
shall be considered a requirement. A central location which will serve equally
the entire development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites
can be located throughout the development according to established standards
for park distances.
   (C)   (1)   When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for
recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a
portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit
developments may, at the option of the Village Board, be provided in the form
of private open space in lieu of dedicated “public” open space. The extent of
same shall be determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the
projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land
for the general area.
      (2)   In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated
parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the
installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer
as part of his or her obligation. Detailed plans of the areas, including
specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village,
and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or
developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be
permanently maintained for the use by the execution of the appropriate legal
documents. Private II “swimming clubs” are included in this provision. When an
adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to
compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the
subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be
given.
(1981 Code, § 22.402) (Ord. 88-15, passed 11-7-1988)
§ 155.072 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK AND SCHOOL
SITES.
   (A)   Where a development is small and the resulting site is too small to be
practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational
purposes or school site, the village shall require the subdivider or developer
to pay a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication required.
   (B)   The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication
or school site dedication shall be held by the village and forwarded semi-
annually (January 1 and July 1) to the school district or the park district, as
appropriate, to be used in the acquisition or development of land for a park
site or a school site or for the improvement to any existing park site or
school site.
      (1)   Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be
based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved, as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and
recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the present fair
market value of the improved land in and surrounding the village is $110,000
per acre and the figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless
the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of
any such objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair
market value of the improved land in the area of his or her development or
other evidence thereof and final determination of the fair market value per
acre of improved land shall be made by the Village Board based upon the
information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources
which may be submitted to the Village Board by the park district, school
district or others.
      (2)   Criteria for requiring the dedication and a fee. There will be
situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of
land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
         (a)   Only a portion of land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park or school site; and (The portion of land within the
subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a
site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in-lieu-thereof shall be required for
any additional land that would have to be dedicated.)
         (b)   A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site
has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the
development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by
dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
   (C)   Contribution fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be restricted to
use solely and exclusively for paying the cost of public facilities and capital
improvements, or for other improvements at the discretion of the Village Board,
within the village, whether payment is made directly therefore, or as a pledge
against bonds, revenue certificates, or other obligations of indebtedness.

by the Illinois School Consulting Services, Associated Municipal Consultants,
Inc., and dated 1996 and numbered 96-4.1A is generally indicative of current
and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall
be used in calculating the required land or cash contribution.
   (B)   (1)   In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection
to the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population listed herein, he or she shall
submit his or her own demographic study showing the estimated additional
population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development
and, in that event, final determination of density formula to be used in the
calculations shall be made by the Village Board based upon the demographic
information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources
which may be submitted to the Village Board by the school district or others.
      (2)   It is recognized that the years, and the specific formula for the
dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein,
is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.

the units in a senior citizen multiple-family dwelling development may be
occupied by physically handicapped persons of any age.
            5.   For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning:

BUSINESS DISTRICTS
§ 157.050 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The business districts set forth herein are established to protect
public health, to promote public safety, comfort, convenience and the general
welfare and to protect the economic base of the village and the value of the
property.
      (2)   These general purposes include, among others, the following
objectives:
         (a)   To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a
well considered plan so that adequate space is provided in appropriate
locations for the various types of business uses, thereby protecting and
strengthening the economic base of the village;
         (b)   To place in separate districts those businesses which may create
noise, odors, hazards, unsightliness or which may generate excessive traffic;
         (c)   To permit selected business uses in districts adjacent to
residential areas where sufficient value or convenience to the residential area
offsets the disadvantages of the business use;
         (d)   To encourage the grouping in appropriate locations of compatible
business uses which will tend to draw trade that is mutually interchangeable
and so promote public convenience and business prosperity and contribute to the
alleviation of traffic and pedestrian congestion by encouraging the use of a
common ingress and egress;
         (e)   To promote the establishment of off-street parking facilities
permitted and required so as to alleviate traffic congestion and so promote
shopping convenience and business prosperity; and
         (f)   To promote design appearance, style and construction of
structures in the business districts which will be essentially compatible with
the residential character of the village.
   (B)   Business districts. The business districts described in this
subchapter include:
      (1)   B-1, downtown business district;
      (2)   B-2, community business district;
      (3)   B-3, service business district;
      (4)   B-4, automotive business district; and
      (5)   O-D, office district.
   (C)   Special uses.
      (1)   It is recognized that there are certain uses which, because of
their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified without
consideration of the impact, in each case, of these uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location.
      (2)   These uses fall into two categories:
         (a)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; or
         (b)   Private uses of such an unusual nature the their operation may
give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring
property.
      (3)   The special uses listed in each district may be permitted by the
adoption of a special use ordinance by the Village Board of Trustees upon
receiving the recommendation of the Plan Commission. The procedures for
requesting a special use permit are described in §§
157.190 through
157.192.
   (D)   Accessory uses.
      (1)   These uses include building or other structures customarily
incidental to and commonly associated with a permitted or special use. These
uses may be permitted provided they are operated and maintained under the same
ownership and on the same lot as the permitted or special use and do not
include structures or structural features inconsistent with these uses and do
not involve the conduct of any business, profession, trade or industry.
      (2)   A further discussion on, and the standards for accessory buildings
and uses, are described in §§
157.080 through
157.092.
   (E)   Lot and bulk provisions. With the exception of planned developments,
these regulations shall be as set forth under each specific business district
contained herein.
   (F)   Allowable use of land or buildings. 
      (1)   Allowable uses table. Permitted uses, special uses, accessory uses,
and temporary uses in the business districts shall be as indicated on the
following table. All other provisions of this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Building Inspector shall determine whether a proposed use
that is not specifically listed on the table is most similar to and compatible
with one or more permitted uses, special uses, accessory uses, temporary uses,
or prohibited uses and classify the use accordingly. Such determinations shall
be recorded in writing and maintained on file in the Village Clerk's office.

is classified as a special use hereby, it shall be considered to be a lawful
special use.
      (2)   Additions or alterations to existing buildings or land improvements
for expansion of lawful special uses may be made within the area of the lot
included in the ownership existing at the time of adoption of this chapter, and
they shall be subject to yard, floor area ratio and building height
requirements set forth in this chapter for permitted uses in the districts in
which they are located.

considered as yard space for another adjoining structure.
   (B)   No lot shall be reduced in area so that the yards or other open spaces
become less than required by this chapter.

buildings existing on lots or tracts having a frontage of 30% or more of the
total frontage on one side of that portion of any street lying between two
intersecting streets, or from an intersecting street and a corporate limits
line, no new building or portion thereof shall project beyond a straight line
drawn between the point closest to the street line of the residence upon either
side of the proposed structure, or if there be residences, but this one side,
then beyond the straight line projected from the front of the two nearest
residences, but this regulation, shall not be interpreted to require a front
yard of more than 125 feet, nor to permit a front yard of less depth than that
of the nearest building. Where the street is curved, the line shall follow the
curve of the street rather than to be a straight line.

street right-of-way line may be established as its front lot line, except that
where two or more through lots are contiguous and a front lot line has been

same street lot line shall thereafter be deemed to be the front lot line of all
contiguous lots. On a through lot, a front yard shall be provided along any lot
line abutting a street.

development regulations:
      (1)   Paving. Permission may be given for a crushed stone base or asphalt
shavings in lieu of permanent roadway or parking lot construction, provided

drainage requirements, pursuant to §
57.101(F).
      (3)   Parking lot lighting. Provided that no activity is scheduled or
planned to take place after dusk, the developer is not obligated to construct
parking lot lighting so long as the proposed use remains a temporary use as
allowed by the Village Board, pursuant to §
157.149.
      (4)   Parking lot landscaping. Permission may be given for waiver of the
requirement of parking lot landscaping, including placement of tree and

§ 157.224 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The development and execution of this chapter is based upon the
division of the village into districts, within which districts the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land are substantially uniform.
      (2)   It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which,
because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any
particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the
impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the
particular use of the particular location.
      (3)   The special uses fall into two categories:
         (a)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; or
         (b)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual
nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to
their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation. Any person having a freehold interest in land, a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest and
which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use the land for
one or more of the special uses provided for in this chapter in the zoning
district in which the land is located.
   (C)   Processing application for special use.
      (1)   The applicant shall provide an application for a special use with

proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth herein for special
uses.
      (2)   The village, at the applicant’s expense, shall give notices of the
public hearing as follows:
         (a)   To the persons to whom the current real estate tax bills are
sent, if any, as shown on the record of the local real estate tax assessor of
all properties lying within 250 feet of the property line of the property for
which the special use is sought.
         (b)   All notices shall be in writing and shall give the time, place
and purpose of the public hearing and shall be mailed not more than 30 days nor
less than 15 days in advance of the hearing. The notice shall be sent by First-
Class mail, properly addressed as shown on the tax assessor’s rolls and with
sufficient postage affixed thereon. The applicant shall file a sworn affidavit
with copies of the notices with the village showing the names and addresses of
all notices sent. The affidavit shall be conclusive presumption of giving of
the notices.
         (c)   The notice of the time and plane of the public hearing will be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the village at least 15 days
and no greater than 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall contain the
address or location of the property where the request is sought, as well as a
brief description of the nature of the request.
         (d)   The village, at the applicant's expense, shall post and maintain
on forms no smaller than 11 inches by 17 inches on a white background for a
period of not less than ten days prior to the hearing the notice thereof as
furnished by the village. The notice of the public hearing shall be posted on
the property for which the special use is sought as follows:
            1.   On an improved and/or unimproved lot: A visible sign not more
than 15 feet from the front lot line.
         (e)   Upon receipt in proper form of the application referred to
above, the Planning, Zoning, and Historic Commission shall hold at least one
public hearing on the proposed special use. However, the Planning, Zoning, and
Historic Commission may continue from time-to-time the hearing without further
notices being published.
      (3)   Within 45 days after the close of the public hearing, the Planning,
Zoning, and Historic Commission shall make written findings of fact, when
required, and shall submit same, together with its recommendations to the
Village President and Board of Trustees. The recommendation shall be consistent
with the purpose and intent of this chapter and shall specify, in a conclusion
or statement, any stipulations, restrictions or conditions, including but not
limited to the operation of the special use, which the Commission deems
necessary to assure compliance with this chapter and the protection of the
public health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare. The Planning, Zoning, and
Historic Commission shall not recommend that a special use be approved unless
it finds that the proposed special use conforms to the standards set forth both
in this chapter and, if any, in the district regulations.
      (4)   A concurring vote of a majority of those members present at the
meeting with a minimum of three concurring votes shall be required to recommend
granting or denying an application for a special use. The report to the Village
Board of the proceedings shall contain the number of Commissioners present and
names of those voting for or against the motion.
      (5)   The Planning, Zoning, and Historic Commission shall make special
use findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case with respect to the following:
         (a)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
         (b)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.

   (D)   The Planning, Zoning, and Historic Commission may recommend that there
be in part of the area of a planned development and for the duration of the
development, specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the
distract in which the development is located, provided that the Plan Commission
shall find that:
      (1)   The uses permitted by the exceptions are necessary or desirable and
are appropriate with respect to the primary propose of the development;
      (2)   The uses permitted by the exception are not of such a nature or so
located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood;
      (3)   Not more than 20% of the ground area or of the gross floor area of

   (E)   The Planning, Zoning, and Historic Commission may recommend that there
be in a planned development exceptions to the bulk regulations set forth herein
the district regulations applicable to the district in which the planned
development is located, provided that the Planning, Zoning, and Historic
Commission shall find:
      (1)   The exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting a
unified site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of the
development as well as the neighboring property than would be obtained by the
bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed on separate lots;
      (2)   The overall floor area ratio, when applicable, would not exceed by
more than 15% the floor area ratio regulation of this chapter for the district
in which it is located;

use by the residents of the dwellings served;
      (6)   The spacing between buildings shall be consistent with the
application of recognized site planning principles for securing a unified
development and due consideration is given to the openness normally afforded by
intervening streets and alleys; (Spacing between principal buildings within a
part of a planned development where subsequent transfer of ownership is
contemplated shall be equivalent to such spacing as would be required between
buildings by district regulations for the district in which it is located.)
      (7)   The yards along the periphery of the development shall be not less
in width or depth than required for permitted uses in the district regulations
applicable to the district in which the planned development is located.
   (F)   Action by the President and Board of Trustees.
      (1)   Prior to the granting of any special use, the President and Board
of Trustees shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special
use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the standards and requirements specified in this subchapter.
The Building Inspector or village police officer may issue violation notices
upon receiving competent evidence that a violation of the conditions of a
special use has occurred. In all cases in which special uses are granted, if
any of the conditions approved with the special use are alleged to have been
violated, the village may revoke the special use or order abatement of the
violation. All revocation proceedings will be administered through the
village's administrative adjudication procedure in accordance with the
provisions of
Chapter 36 of this code. The property owner and/or special use permit holder
shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, present witnesses, and offer
evidence relevant to the issue at the hearing. The administrative hearing
officer shall also hear evidence from the village relevant to the issue.
      (2)   The President and Board of Trustees may grant or deny any
application for a special use permit after receiving the recommendations of the
Planning, Zoning, and Historic Commission, including the stipulations of
additional conditions and guarantees, when they are deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest.
      (3)   No application for a special use which has been denied wholly or in
part by the President and Board of Trustees shall be resubmitted for a period
of six months from the date of the order or denial.
      (4)   In any case, where a special use permit has been granted and a
building permit has not been obtained within 18 months after the date of
granting thereof, then without further action by the Plan Commission and the
President and Board of Trustees, the special use permit approval shall
automatically be terminated and cancelled and be null and void. In the event
that an occupancy certificate is not issued within five years after the special
use permit has been granted, the special use permit shall automatically
terminate.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 157.240 PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Planned Unit Developments are unique and differ substantially from
conventional subdivisions and therefore require administrative processing as
"special uses" under this title. Planned Unit Developments are a complex type
of special use, potentially consisting of various land uses and design
elements, requiring the establishment of more specific procedures, standards
and exceptions from the strict application of the zoning district regulations
to guide the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
action of the Village Board.
      (2)   The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to provide for an
alternative zoning procedure under which land can be developed or redeveloped
with innovation, increased amenities and creative environmental and
architectural design than would be possible to achieve under the otherwise
standard zoning district regulations while being in general compliance with the
planning objectives and intent of the zoning ordinance. Under this procedure,
well planned residential, industrial/manufacturing, commercial and other types
of land uses, individually or in combination, may be developed with design
flexibility allowing for full utilization of the topographical and
environmental characteristics of the site.
      (3)   Planned Unit Developments must have an approved development plan
which provides for a unified design, contiguity between various elements and be
environmentally compatible with the surrounding area. There should be an
increased benefit upon the health, safety and general welfare of the public and
developments built in conformity with the underlying district regulations. If
building density is increased above densities allowable by the zoning district
in which the use would be permitted on a particular portion of a PUD; then the
amount of open space, retention of existing vegetation, buffer areas, new
landscape, public commons, community open space, and parks shall be evaluated
for proportionate increase for the remainder of the PUD.
   (B)   Intent. The Planned Unit Development is not intended to be a mechanism
solely used for the allowance of increased densities or as a means of
circumventing the bulk regulations or zoning standards under this title; rather
a Planned Unit Development shall generally provide attributes in excess of
conventional village zoning, building and other land use requirements such as,
but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Providing a maximum choice of the overall living environment
through a variety of type, design and layout of residential structures,
commercial and industrial buildings, office and research uses and public
facilities.
      (2)   Demonstrating excellence in environmental design and the mitigation
of land use factors or impacts.
      (3)   Promoting a more useful pattern of dedicated open space and
recreation areas incorporated as part of the development plan and that is
compatible with the immediate vicinity.
      (4)   Provide public access and pedestrian connectivity via bicycle/
recreational paths, sidewalks and/or alternative modes of transportation.
      (5)   Providing and or preserving substantial landscaping with emphasis
given to streetscape areas, buffer zones, and the provision of significant
landscaping (in terms of size of landscape areas and quantity and quality of
landscape materials) within the developed portions of the site.
      (6)   Incorporating a consistent architectural theme which is unique to
the specific site and surrounding community through the use of building
materials, signage and way-finding standards as well as design elements.
Generic corporate architecture and big box designs are strongly discouraged but
not prohibited. Uses should be designed according to the limitation of the site
rather than the removal of the limitations. Specific design details such as
roof parapets, architectural details, varying roof heights, pitches and
materials and building colors and materials should be addressed.
      (7)   Retain, utilize and incorporate historic features on the project
site into the overall project design, if physically and economically feasible;
and/or
      (8)   Promote and strengthen the economic vitality and enhance the
aesthetic qualities of unified large-scale commercial developments.
      (9)   Encourage high-quality planned industrial park environments and
well-designed business centers for single or multiple-tenant facilities.
      (10)   Provide/enhance regional public infrastructure such as roadways,
water/sanitary service, stormwater management objectives.

Developments. The Village Board shall have final decision to approve, approve
with modification, or deny applications for Planned Unit Developments.
   (B)   The procedures set forth in this chapter shall apply to all Planned
Unit Developments.
   (C)   Planned Unit Developments may be allowed in each of the zoning
districts in the Village of East Dundee only as a special use as prescribed in
§
157.086 and approved pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
157.224.
   (D)   Bulk regulations set forth in the zoning ordinance shall not apply to
Planned Unit Developments; provided, however, that the off-street parking and
loading regulations set forth in §§
157.120 through
157.150 of this title shall apply to all Planned Unit Developments.
(Ord. 14-27, passed 9-15-2014)
§ 157.242 DEFINITION AND SIZE LIMITATIONS.

all newly constructed buildings and sites within a Planned Unit Development.
Each proposed development will be evaluated on its compliance with the
established regulations/guidelines contained herein.
   (C)   Density. The density, minimum lot size and minimum setback dimension
for each use proposed within a PUD shall be determined by the conventional
zoning classification which would permit the proposed use unless a variance is
specifically requested as part of the special use request.
   (D)   Use regulations. Planned Unit Developments may be comprised of a
single-type of land use or a mixture of land uses when applicable and when
different intensity of land uses are appropriately buffered or separated.
      (1)   Uses proposed shall be consistent with those listed as allowable
uses in the respective zoning districts.
      (2)   Uses listed as special uses in the zoning district in which the
development is located may be allowed.
   (E)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village Board
may approve access to a dwelling by a driveway or pedestrian walk easement. Off
street parking facilities for such dwelling shall be located not more than 200
feet from the dwelling served.
   (F)   The Planning and Zoning Commission also may recommend and the Village
Board may approve yards of lesser widths or depths than required for permitted
uses in the zoning classification which the planned development is including,
provided:
      (1)   Those protective covenants are recorded with perpetual access
easements and off street parking spaces for use by the residents of the
dwellings served.
      (2)   That spacing between buildings shall be consistent with the
application of recognized site planning principles for securing a unified
development and that due consideration is given to the openness normally
afforded by intervening streets and alleys.
      (3)   The yards for principal buildings along the periphery of the
development shall be not less in width or depth than required for permitted
uses in the district in which the planned unit development is included and the
plan is developed to afford adequate protection to neighboring properties, i.e.
fire protection and sufficient area needed for utility easements, as
recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the Village
Board.

§ 158.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   These standards are established to create attractive and harmonious
landscape, screening and tree preservation standards for the development of
property in the village. The intent of the required plan review is to ensure
that the village remains attractive, safe and comfortable. This chapter shall
govern all developments except detached single and attached two-family
residential subdivisions.
   (B)   Parkway trees along all public streets shall be provided in all new
developments including detached single and attached two-family residential
subdivisions in accordance with the requirements set forth in the village
Forestry Standards and Specifications for the village.
   (C)   The goals of these landscaping standards are to minimize the harmful
impact of noise created by vehicular traffic in areas of new development, to
reduce the negative impact of wind which spreads dust and debris across non-
landscaped areas, to control the intrusion of excess artificial lighting at
night by lighting fixtures and automobile traffic, to reduce the excessive heat
generated by large areas of pavement, and to provide a portion of the
development with a pervious surface which will allow for a moderate amount of
percolation of storm water into the ground.
   (D)   In the event an interpretation of this chapter is necessary, the
Village Board shall make such interpretation and may secure professional advice
from an Illinois registered landscape architect.
(Ord. 05-02, passed 1-18-2005)
§ 158.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions noted below apply uniquely to this chapter.
   EXTERIOR PARKWAY. The unpaved portion of the public street right-of-way in
front of a property, located between the edge of pavement or back of curb and
the sidewalk (see Diagram 1 of the Appendix).
   FOUNDATION AREA. The ground area immediately adjacent to a building on all
sides thereof. Foundation areas extend a minimum of five feet in all directions
from the foundation of the building (see Diagram 2 of the Appendix).
   INTERIOR LANDSCAPE AREA. The open space area behind and between buildings on
a site with multiple structures, excluding the interior parkway, foundation
area and perimeter landscape area.
   INTERIOR PARKWAY. A landscaped open space area extending from the right-of-
way line to the closest site improvement, a minimum of ten feet from all street
rights-of-way (see Diagram 1 of the Appendix).
   LANDSCAPED OPEN SPACE. Land covered by trees, shrubs, turf grasses, or
ground cover impervious surfaces, such as buildings, parking lots, walkways, or
patios are not considered landscaped open space.
   PERIMETER LANDSCAPE AREA. An area around the periphery or outer perimeter of
a property which does not front on a public road (see Diagrams 1 and 2 of the
Appendix). The perimeter landscape area extends from the property line to the
nearest building face, parking area, or access drive, exclusive of the
foundation area and the interior parkway.
   PROTECTED TREE. An existing tree with a trunk diameter of six inches or
greater which will remain after construction representative examples of which
are listed in §
158.06, Table 3. The final determination of whether an existing tree is a
protected tree hereunder shall be subject to review by the village.
(Ord. 05-02, passed 1-18-2005)
§ 158.03 PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   The following shall establish the standards for the preparation and
submission of required plans for landscape, screening and tree preservation.
   (A)   Landscape plan required. A landscape plan approved by the village
staff on the basis of the standards set forth in this chapter shall be required
for all projects requiring site plan review and/or a special use permit.
   (B)   Content of landscape plan. All landscape plans shall be prepared by an
Illinois registered landscape architect and shall include or have attached
thereto the following information:
      (1)   North arrow, scale, name and address of preparer.
      (2)   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed buildings,
structures, parking lots and driveways, roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks,
bicycle paths, ground signs, refuse disposal areas, fences, free-standing
electrical equipment, light fixtures, other surface utility structures, and
other free-standing structural features, tot lots and other recreational or
amenity facilities, setbacks and easements. The landscape plan shall be drawn
at a scale not smaller than one inch equals 20 feet (1" = 20'). Street
plantings as required by the subdivision control ordinance can be drawn at the
scale of the engineering drawings.
      (3)   The location, quantity and size of all trees, shrubs and ground
cover with both the scientific and common names shall be listed. The height and
trunk diameter of existing trees and the height and coverage of existing shrubs
will be shown.
      (4)   Existing and proposed contours, including the location of all
proposed berming, at a one foot contour interval. Also included shall be the
location, extent and general elevations of all storm water detention or
retention areas and drainage ways.
      (5)   (a)   The designation, location, type and size of all existing
trees four inches and larger in diameter measured one foot above natural grade.
Any trees to be removed should be clearly identified with their replacement
shown. Trees measuring between two and one-half inches and four inches in
diameter which will be used to meet landscape requirements shall also be
indicated.
         (b)   Where existing trees are grouped in a dense cluster, an overall
tree mass may be measured for size and variety in tabular form without a
specific delineation of the location of individual trees. If this technique is
used, trees identified as "protected trees" must be tagged on-site and
identified on the plan in tabular form. The sum of all such protected trees may
then be used to meet site landscape requirements. The provisions to be
implemented for preserving existing trees should be specified on the landscape
plan. If required for reasons of clarity, this information may be placed on an
additional illustration or prepared as a tree protection plan.
      (6)   Details of all fences and walls proposed to be constructed on the
site.
      (7)   Elevations, cross-sections and other site construction details
determined to be necessary by the village. Maximum allowable finished lawn or
mowable slope for any landscaped area will be 3:1.
   (C)   Timing of landscape improvements.
      (1)   All required landscaping shall be installed prior to the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy. The best times for planting in this area are
early spring and early fall, normally between the dates of April 15 to June 15
and August 30 to October 30. Plants installed in the summer must provide for
adequate irrigation methods to reduce the risk of dehydration.
      (2)   If weather conditions or other circumstances beyond the owner's or
developer's control prevent installation of all or portions of the landscape
materials and all other requirements for the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy have been met, a letter of credit or a performance guarantee approved
by the Village Attorney to insure completion of the approved landscaping shall
be filed with the Village Treasurer. The amount of the performance guarantee
and the required completion date shall be approved by the Village Administrator
based on a cost estimate for the approved landscaping plan remaining to be
completed prepared by an Illinois registered landscape architect engaged by the
owner/developer. If such a letter of credit or performance guarantee has
already been submitted for the proposed landscape improvements, the Village
Board may permit the developer to extend the performance guarantee for an
additional period of time acceptable to the Village Board.
(Ord. 05-02, passed 1-18-2005)
§ 158.04 LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS.
   The following shall establish standards for the landscape improvements
required to be installed as part of the development of new buildings,
structures and uses of land governed by this chapter:
   (A)   General landscape standards. Every development shall provide
sufficient landscaping so that:
      (1)   Neighboring properties are shielded from the negative air
pollution, dust, debris, artificial light, noise and visual influence of that
development;
      (2)   The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent
uses.
      (3)   The appearance and desirability of the development contributes to
the overall attractiveness and economic health of the village.
   (B)   Minimum landscaped open space. For each parcel of land to be
developed, the minimum landscaped open space shall comply with standards
established in division (D) of this section. In zoning districts for which no
minimum landscaped open space requirements are specified, a minimum of 15% of
the total parcel shall be devoted to landscaped open space area. Division (D)
of this section details landscape requirements for various portions of the
total landscaped open space.
   (C)   Flexibility in the administration of required landscape standards. 
      (1)   To meet the objectives outlined in division (D) of this section,
the following landscape requirements are hereby established. These standards
provide specific requirements for site landscaping. However, the village
recognizes that, because of the wide variety of types of developments and the
relationships between them, some flexibility in applying standards set forth in
division (D) of this section are appropriate as long as the intent of specified
requirements are met. Any deviation from the requirements of any specific
chapter shall require a variation, which must be approved by the Village Board.
      (2)   Whenever the village allows or requires deviation from the
requirements set forth in this chapter, it shall enter on the face of the
landscape plan the reasons for allowing or requiring deviation from the
requirements set forth herein. The maximum amount of any deviation or variation
will be 20%.
   (D)   Types of landscaped areas. 
      (1)   This chapter regulates landscaping of five distinct areas of a
parcel as follows:
         (a)   Interior parkways;
         (b)   Perimeter areas;
         (c)   Foundation areas;
         (d)   Parking lots; and
         (e)   Site interiors.
      (2)   Diagrams 1, 2 and 3 of the Appendix provide graphic illustrations
of each area. Each area shall be landscaped in accordance with the following
criteria:
         (a)   Interior parkway landscaping.
            1.   All interior parkways shall be planted by the owner or
developer in all zoning districts as identified in the following table:
Table 1
Interior Parkway Requirements
Zoning Classification Minimum Interior Parkway (feet)
Table 1
Interior Parkway Requirements
Zoning Classification                      Minimum Interior Parkway (feet)
R-4 Attached Dwellings Exceeding Two Units 10
R-5 Multi-Family Residence                 10
B-1 Downtown Business                      Considered on case-to-case basis
B-2 Local Business                         10
B-3 Service Business                       10
B-4 Heavy Service Business                 30
O-D Office District                        30
M-1 Limited Manufacturing District         10
PUD Planned Unit Development               10 - 100
 
Note: Property zoned PUD shall meet or exceed perimeter screening required of
the most appropriate standard zoning district as determined by the Village
Administrator.
            2.   Except for access drives, interior parkways shall be
landscaped as follows:
               a.   One tree per 30 feet of street frontage shall be provided.
At least 50% of the required trees shall be large deciduous or evergreen trees
as identified in the recommended trees, shrubs and ground cover list in §
158.06, Table 3. Tree type may vary depending on design intent. However, as a
general rule, monoculture of an individual tree specie is discouraged. A
grouping of three to five trees of the same species alternating between
different specie groups will ensure the best protection from plant material
diseases.
               b.   In addition, shrub planting shall screen the parking area
from the roadway. This shrub planting shall be a minimum of three feet in
height and be located within the interior parkway. A maximum of 25% of the
parking lot frontage may be left unscreened to permit design flexibility (see
Diagram 4 in the Appendix). However, when the landscape plan indicates a single
row of shrubs, the entire parking lot frontage shall be screened. The remainder
of the interior parkway shall be planted with ground cover, flowers, or grass.
         (b)   Perimeter landscape area.
            1.   The appropriateness of proposed perimeter landscaping will
depend upon the relationship between the proposed use of the property and
adjacent properties. Three types of perimeter screening have been defined. The
particular type of screening that will be required shall depend upon the
relationship of the proposed land use and the adjacent land use. Type 1
screening shall generally be required between residential and nonresidential
uses. Type 2 perimeter landscape screening shall generally be required to
provide screening of parking areas between adjacent nonresidential uses. Type 3
perimeter landscape screening shall generally be required between low and high
density residential areas.
            2.   Tables 2A and 2B shall be used to determine the requirements
for perimeter screening between uses. Where the adjacent property has already
been developed, the required screening shall be governed by the existing use.
Table 2A details screening and buffering requirements where the adjacent
property has been developed. In cases where a mixed use development exists on
the adjacent parcel, the predominate use on that site shall determine the
required screening.
            3.   Table 2B shall be used to determine required screening where
the adjacent property is undeveloped. Current zoning shall determine the
appropriate screening treatment. The comprehensive plan shall be used to
determine the anticipated use and the resulting screening requirements for
adjoining properties not annexed to the village at the present time.

Screening (Diagram 4)
1. Type 1
2. Type 2
3. Type 3
4. No screening required
When a proposed use is adjacent to a property zoned PUD, the Village
Administrator shall determine appropriate screening required based on the
most appropriate standard zoning district.
 
            4.   Minimum perimeter landscape requirements shall be as follows:
               a.   Type 1 screening. Type 1 perimeter landscape requirements
are designed to provide a substantial buffer between uses. Where Type 1
screening is required on Table 2A or 2B, one of the following three buffering
alternatives shall be required. The property owner may select the buffering
alternative which best meets the configuration of the site and the proposed
development. All fences, walls and hedges shall comply with village
requirements before approval.
                  i.   Alternate A: The buffering area shall be a minimum of
eight feet in width. An opaque brick or other approved masonry wall six feet
high shall be constructed along the entire perimeter, excluding area within the
required front yard setback. The wall may be continued within the front yard
provided the height is reduced to three feet. If the proposed use is for a
mining operation or for related building or structure for screening, crushing,
mining, washing or storage, the required masonry wall shall be eight feet high.
In addition, four inch caliper deciduous trees in a quantity equal to one tree
per 50 feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Tree spacing shall be
determined by tree species and design considerations.
                  ii.   Alternate B: A minimum 12 foot buffer area shall be
required for this alternative. A fence of wood or other approved material six
feet high and at least 75% opaque shall be constructed along the entire
perimeter, excluding area within the required front yard setback. The fence may
be continued within the front yard provided the height is reduced to three
feet. If the proposed use is for a mining operation or for related building or
structure for screening, crushing, mining, washing or storage, the required
masonry wall shall be eight feet high. In addition, one shrub per ten feet long
of perimeter length shall be planted within the buffer area. Deciduous trees
with a three inch caliper shall be provided in a quantity equal to one tree per
40 feet of perimeter length. Tree location shall be determined by tree species
and design considerations.
                  iii.   Alternate C: A minimum 25 foot buffer area shall be
required. A berm at least three feet in height with undulating top and sides,
with a maximum three to one (3:1) slope, shall be constructed along the entire
perimeter. Breaks in the berm may be provided to accommodate drainage. The berm
shall be planted with one shrub per ten feet of perimeter length four feet or
greater in height to provide screening along at least 75% of the perimeter
length. Trees with a two and one-half inch caliper shall be provided in a
quantity equal to one tree per 40 feet of perimeter length. Tree spacing shall
be determined by tree species and design considerations. Up to 25% of the
required trees in this screening alternative may be small deciduous trees (crab
apples, service berries etc.) with a two inch caliper or six foot height.
               b.   Type 2 screening. Type 2 perimeter landscape screening is
generally required between adjacent non-residential uses to screen parking
areas from adjacent uses. Where a parking lot will be placed along a perimeter
such that parked cars will face the abutting property, shrubs and trees shall
be required. Shrubs shall be provided along at least 50% of the length of the
parking areas. Where parking will be placed adjacent to a residential use,
shrub screening shall be continuous along the entire parking area and a minimum
of six feet high. Shrubs shall be a minimum of three feet in height when
screening a parking lot from adjacent non-residential uses. Trees shall be
provided in a quantity equal to one large deciduous tree per 40 feet of parking
lot length. Tree spacing shall be determined by tree species and design
considerations. Up to 25% of the required trees in this screening shall be
continuous along the entire parking area and a minimum of six feet high. Shrubs
shall be a minimum of three feet in height when screening a parking lot from
adjacent non-residential uses. Up to 25% of the required trees in this
screening alternative may be small deciduous trees (Crab apples, etc.). If the
proposed use is for a mining operation or for related building or structure for
screening, crushing, mining, washing or storage, an eight foot high fence or
wall shall be provided along the perimeter in lieu of parking lot screening.
               c.   Type 3 screening. Type 3 perimeter landscape screening is
generally required between low and high density residential areas. Where a Type
3 screen is required according to Table 1, berming, trees and shrubs shall be
provided to create a visual separation between properties. Appropriate berm
height will depend on the width of the landscape area, with no berm having a
slope greater than three to one (3:1). A minimum of 60% of the length of the
perimeter shall be planted with two foot shrubs that will reach a height of at
least six feet. Trees shall be required in a quantity equal to one tree per 40
feet of lot line length. Tree spacing shall be determined by tree species and
design considerations. Up to 25% of the required trees in this screening
alternative may be small deciduous trees (crab apples, etc.).
         (c)   Foundation area landscaping. A minimum five foot wide landscape
area is required adjacent to all building walls (exclusive of driveways, access
walks, and service and delivery areas). Planting should emphasize ground plane
transitions and softening large expanses of building walls, when possible,
accenting building entrances and architectural features, and screening
mechanical equipment. Where extended roofs or canopies are used to provide a
covered walkway adjacent to a building, foundation plantings are not required.
However, landscaping is recommended to separate vehicular areas from buildings.
         (d)   Parking lot landscaping. Landscaping shall be required within
all parking lots containing 20 or more parking spaces to meet the following
standards:
            1.   There shall be a minimum seven foot wide (measured from back
of curb) curbed planting island at the end of every parking row. The depth of
the planting island shall be equal to the depth of the parking stalls.
            2.   To break up long expanses of parking rows, landscape islands
are required. One of the following three alternatives shall be used to divide
rows of ten or more parking spaces.
               a.   Alternative A. A continuous curbed landscape island between
rows may be provided in lieu of full stall planting islands between parking
bays. Where such a continuous island is provided, it shall be a minimum of
eight feet in width measured back to back of curbs and shall contain a minimum
of one tree for every ten parking spaces (see Diagram 6 in Appendix).
               b.   Alternative B. A maximum of ten parking spaces will be
permitted in any length of parking bay between planting islands. A curbed
island at least seven feet wide and as deep as the parking stalls shall be
provided to divide the bay length. There shall be a minimum of two large
deciduous trees per island. Tree branching shall start no less than six feet
above the pavement measured from pavement level.
               c.   Alternative C. Smaller curbed islands at the head of and
between parking stalls may be permitted. If smaller curbed planting islands are
appropriate, they shall be a minimum of six and one-half feet by six and one-
half feet, measured from back of curb to back of curb and shall be provided at
the rate of two small islands for every full size island required in
Alternative B. The parking stall width adjacent to the small islands shall be
increased to a minimum width of 11 feet. There shall be a minimum of one large
deciduous tree per island. Branching shall start no less than six feet above
the pavement measured from pavement level.
            3.   In addition to required trees, an appropriate planting of
shrubs, ground cover plants, flowers, sodded lawn and mulch shall be provided
within all landscape islands. To insure visibility, shrubs shall not exceed a
mature height of 30 inches above pavement on landscape islands at the end of
parking rows (see Diagrams 7 and 8 in the Appendix).
         (e)   Site interior landscaping.
            1.   On parcels with more than one structure, the open space
between buildings shall be appropriately landscaped to provide:
               a.   Screening of adjacent dwelling units.
               b.   Screening and shading to improve energy efficiency.
               c.   A visually appealing living environment.
            2.   The planting of trees is the most effective means of defining
and enhancing open space areas. As the appropriate quantity and location of
trees will be dependent upon the site and building configuration of individual
developments, each project will be evaluated independently. However, open space
areas within the interior of a site should generally contain a minimum of one
tree per 5,000 square feet of open space.
            3.   Other landscape features, including shrubs, flowers, ground
cover, grasses, and berming should be used as appropriate to enhance the
overall appearance and function of the open space area.
   (E)   Landscape design requirements. Functional activities within and
adjoining the development site must be considered in the design of landscape
improvements, including consideration of the following:
      (1)   Service area screening. All service areas shall be screened from
view through the use of evergreen plant materials, masonry walls or fences
compatible with the proposed building design.
         (a)   Trash dumpsters and other waste receptacles or equipment shall
be screened with three sided brick or other approved masonry walls being a
minimum of six feet in height and not less than one foot above the height of
the proposed trash containers and other storage devices with a solid,
attractive single or double access gate of the required height on the remaining
side as access to the trash facility. The trash enclosure shall be designed to
complement the architectural character and features of the principal building
on the site.
         (b)   All utility equipment (meters, transformers, boxes, pedestals,
etc.) shall be provided with appropriate planting screens. A note which
specifies that all equipment will be screened will be required when the
location of the equipment is not available. All dish antennas shall be screened
from view of adjoining properties and abutting streets by an opaque wall,
fence, hedge or berm.
         (c)   All garage doors and loading areas shall be screened so as not
to be visible from adjoining rights-of-way and property zoned for any
residential use.
         (d)   All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials, building
products and construction equipment within 500 feet of a residential district,
or within view of an adjacent roadway, shall be effectively screened and
enclosed by a solid wall or fence at least eight feet in height. If materials
to be stored outdoors are in excess of eight feet in height, then landscape
screening shall be provided in addition to the fence or wall installed along
the outside perimeter of the fence or wall, equal or exceeding the height of
the materials to be stored outdoors.
      (2)   Intersection visibility.
         (a)   Landscaping must be designed and installed to minimize potential
obstruction of critical sight lines.
         (b)   Landscape planting shall be so designed as to avoid obstruction
of a motorist's vision at the intersections of outlet access drives and ring
roads, access roads, or municipal streets.
         (c)   Unobstructed visibility between two feet and six feet above the
height of the paved surface of the access road must be maintained at all
intersections. To maintain this visibility, no shrubs or other landscape
material which will reach a mature height greater than two feet shall be
permitted within ten feet of the right-of-way of a primary thoroughfare, or
five feet from the right-of-way of a lesser roadway, for a distance of 40 feet
from the right-of-way intersection (see Diagram 9 in the Appendix). Trees are
allowed in these critical visibility areas if the lowest branching begins not
less than six feet above the pavement.
      (3)   Parking area island planters. All parking area island planters
should be over-excavated to a minimum depth of two feet for their entire width
and length, backfilled with an appropriate mix of topsoil, peat moss and
nutrients to replace the excavated material, and shall be compacted, leaving a
crowned or mounded top a minimum of six inches above the curb bordering the
planter island.
      (4)   Berming. Berming shall not exceed a maximum slope of three to one
(3:1) when mowing maintenance will be required.
      (5)   Mulching. Mulch materials shall be shredded bark or other organic
material best suited for the village. Lava rock or large diameter (1 ½ inch
diameter plus) bark chips ("chunk bark") are not acceptable. Gravel and stone
mulches are not permitted, unless specifically approved in writing by the
village. Mulch beds shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the center of a
shrub and/or tree.
      (6)   Wood fence requirements. All wood fences proposed to be used to
meet perimeter screening requirements shall be of red cedar, redwood, cypress,
or other approved decay-resistant treated wood, at least six feet high, and of
solid construction. Wood fences shall not be less than 75% opaque, with all
supporting posts exposed to the lot interior. Stockade-type fences are not
permitted.
(Ord. 05-02, passed 1-18-2005)
§ 158.05 TREE PRESERVATION.
   An existing tree survey is required in order to preserve specimen trees and
forested areas throughout the village:
   (A)   (1)   To encourage the preservation of existing trees, tree planting
requirements for new developments will be reduced based on the number and size
of existing trees that are so protected as to assure their survival. The
following table outlines a credit system whereby protected trees are credited
against the total number of trees required for a development:
 
   Existing Tree Diamet   Credit Applied to New Tree Planting Requirement
2 ½" or less             No credit
2 ½" - 4"                1.0
4 ½" - 7"                2.0
7 ¼"- 15 ¾"             3.0
16" or more               5.0
 
      (2)   Tree diameters shall be measured 12 inches above natural grade, the
total credit shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
      (3)   Existing multi-stemmed plant material will be reviewed by the
village on a case-by-case basis.
   (B)   Should any required tree designated for preservation in the landscape
plan die or be removed within 18 months of issuance of certificate of
occupancy, the owner or developer shall replace it with three inch minimum
caliper trees in proportion to the tree credit originally granted. (For
example, assume a 15 inch diameter tree was proposed for preservation and
credit was given to the property owner exempting the planting of three new
trees. If this tree should later die, then three inch caliper trees shall be
planted to replace the 15 inch tree.)
   (C)   Guide for protecting existing trees. To better ensure the survival of
existing trees, the developer should implement the following guidelines:
      (1)   Protect trees with a minimum three foot high construction fence
during the entire construction period. Fencing should be placed at or beyond
the dripline of protected trees. Where this is not feasible, fencing should be
a minimum of ten feet from the center of any given tree in all directions.
Bright colored plastic fencing is preferred.
      (2)   Do not permit the soil around existing trees to be compacted by
heavy equipment. Do not pile dirt or other materials beneath the crown of
trees.
      (3)   Keep fires or other sources of heat well clear of existing trees.
      (4)   Repair damaged roots and branches immediately. Exposed roots should
be covered with topsoil to a depth that matches soil coverage prior to
disturbance. Whenever roots are destroyed, a proportional amount of branches
must be pruned so the tree does not transpire more water than it takes in.
Injured trees must be thoroughly watered during the ensuing growing year.
      (5)   Prune all existing trees surrounded by paving to prevent
dehydration.
      (6)   The existing elevations around protected trees should be maintained
to the fullest extent possible. Where grade changes of four inches or more are
required within the dripline of a protected tree, low retaining walls or other
appropriate tree protection techniques should be used to insure the long-term
health of the tree.
(Ord. 05-02, passed 1-18-2005)
§ 158.06 GUIDE FOR LANDSCAPE PLAN REVIEW.
   The following guidelines shall be considered in reviewing the design and
implementation of landscape plans in conjunction with review of site plans and
special use permits.
   (A)   Standards for plant materials. Materials planted in any development
shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   The quality of plant material selected shall meet or exceed the
guidelines in the latest edition of the American Standard of Nursery Stock
published by the American Association of Nurserymen unless otherwise indicated.
      (2)   No artificial plants of any type shall be used to meet the
requirements of this chapter in any landscape area within the parcel.
      (3)   Minimum sizes for plant materials at time of installation for all
landscape areas shall be as follows:
         (a)   Deciduous trees shall be a minimum size of two and one-half
inches caliper when installed. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum six feet in
height when installed.
         (b)   Deciduous shrubs (other than dwarf varieties) shall be a minimum
of 36 inches in height at time of installation if used as a perimeter screen
planting, and 30 inches in height for all other installations. Dwarf varieties,
evergreen shrubs, and plants normally measured by spread shall be a minimum of
24 inches in both height and spread.
         (c)   Ground cover shall be planted at a minimum of 12 inches on
center to ensure that complete coverage can be obtained within two years after
date of installation.
         (d)   Flower beds are encouraged and shall be mass planted in
acceptable areas to create color, texture and interest.
      (4)   Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining all
landscaping shown on the approved landscape plan throughout the life of the
development. All dead plants shall be replaced with plants that meet the
original requirements. The plant replacement shall be completed in the next
horticulturally advisable planting season for the species being replaced after
the village staff has notified the owner that replacement is necessary. Annual
flower beds shall be replanted each year with flowers adapted to the village's
climatic conditions.
   (B)   Guide for planting trees. The trees recommended in division (D) of
this section have minimal maintenance requirements. However, all trees must
receive a certain degree of care, especially during and immediately after
planting. To protect an investment in new trees, the owner or developer should
ensure that proper horticultural techniques are followed. The following
recommendations are provided as a guide for tree planting based on current
horticultural practice.
      (1)   The best times for planting are early spring and early fall. Plants
planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration if not properly irrigated.
      (2)   Plant trees and shrubs at least three feet from the back of curb
along head-in parking spaces to prevent damage from car overhangs. Mulch, lawn
or planted ground cover shall be utilized in this three foot area. Aligning
trees with the stripes between parking stalls will further help avoid damage.
      (3)   Dig tree pits at least one foot wider than the root ball.
      (4)   Especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the
soil, the bottom of the pit should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or
shovel.
      (5)   After a pit is dug, observe subsurface drainage conditions. Where
poor drainage exists, special provisions should be made to ensure proper
drainage around the tree.
      (6)   Backfill should include a proper mix of soil, peat moss, and
nutrients. All roots must be completely covered. Backfill should be thoroughly
watered as it is placed around the roots.
      (7)   Plants should remain plumb and level. Newly planted trees may be
supported with stakes and ties to hold it firmly in place. Remove stakes and
ties after one year.
      (8)   Spread at least three inches of mulch over plant beds in order to
retain moisture and keep down weeds. A three inch saucer should be provided to
form a basin around the trunk of the tree. This saucer helps catch and retain
moisture.
      (9)   The lower trunks of new trees may be wrapped with burlap or paper
to prevent evaporation and sun scald. The wrapping should remain on the tree
for a least one year.
      (10)   Conscientious post-planting care, especially watering, pruning and
fertilizing, is a must for street and parking lot trees. Branches of new trees
may be reduced by as much as one-third to prevent excessive evaporation.
   (C)   Guide for planting shrubs. Shrubs planted for screening purposes
should be given a proper growing environment. Many of the guidelines for tree
planting listed in division (B) of this section also apply to shrubs. However,
because specific requirements vary considerably between shrub types, this
guideline does not attempt to specify the needs of all shrubs.
   (D)   Lists of recommended trees, shrubs and ground cover. The following
list indicates plantings which will meet the landscape requirements of the
village. The lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to
suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for these purposes.
Plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to four principal
criteria: general suitablility for the climate and soil conditions of this
area, ease of maintenance, tolerance of urban conditions, and availability from
area nurseries.

Impact Fee Ordinance" and may be cited herein as this chapter.
(Ord. 05-17, passed 8-15-2005)
§ 159.02 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is declared to be the policy of the village that the provision of
various public facilities and services required to serve new development is
subject to the control of the village in accordance with the comprehensive plan
of the village for the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical development
of the village.
   (B)   New developments cause and impose increased and excessive demands upon
public facilities and services that are specifically and uniquely attributable
to those new developments.
   (C)   Planning projections indicate that new development shall continue and
shall place ever-increasing demands on public facilities and services.
   (D)   Development potential and property values are influenced and affected
by village policy as expressed in the comprehensive plan and as implemented by
the village zoning ordinance.
   (E)   To the extent that new developments place demands upon public
facilities and services that are specifically and uniquely attributable to such
developments, those demands should be satisfied by requiring that the new
developments creating the demands pay the cost of meeting the demands.
   (F)   The Village Board of Trustees, after careful consideration, hereby
finds and declares that imposition of development impact fees upon new

§ 160.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Certain costs are necessarily incurred by the village in processing
building permits, petitions for annexation, disconnections, rezoning,
variances, planned unit developments, subdivisions, site plans and other land
use matters (the development petition), including, but not limited to, staff
costs and fees of planning consultants, engineers, attorneys, building
officials, environmental consultants, and other consultants, as well as other
expenses of the village related to the development petition such as mailing,
photocopying, telephone, publication, recording and other out of pocket costs
(collectively "development costs").
   (B)   The Village Board has determined that development costs should be
borne by the person filing a development petition ("petitioner") rather than
the taxpayers of the village.
(Ord. 17-50, passed 10-2-2017)
§ 160.02 TRUST AND AGENCY ACCOUNT.
   (A)   The village shall establish a trust and agency account (also known as
an escrow account):
      (1)   For the purpose of accounting for development costs and
reimbursement for such costs with sub-accounts for each separate petitioner;
and
      (2)   For the purpose of accounting for other deposits being held in
trust from time to time.
   (B)   Such trust and agency accounts shall be subject to audit as in the
case of all other accounts and funds of the village but shall not be part of
the budget process of the village.
(Ord. 17-50, passed 10-2-2017)
§ 160.03 DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Initial deposit. Whenever the village is asked to consider a
development petition and it is estimated by the Village Administrator or
designee that the development costs shall exceed $1,000, the Village
Administrator or designee shall prior to the time when the village incurs any
expense for staff or consultants establish the initial deposit and a minimum
balance in the trust and agency account of the village (the "initial deposit").
Before any expenses for consultant and out of pocket costs are incurred by the
village, the petitioner shall pay to the village's Finance Director the amount
of such initial deposit.
   (B)   Second and subsequent deposits. The petitioner is responsible for
maintaining the minimum balance in the trust and agency account as established
by the Village Administrator or designee at time of initial deposit.
   (C)   Failure to make deposits. In the event that the petitioner fails to
promptly make the required payments of the initial deposit, the second deposit
or any subsequent deposit, the village may advise all consultants to the
village to cease performing any services and incurring any costs relative to
the development petition, and the village may postpone or cancel any scheduled
hearings, meetings or considerations of the pending development petition.
   (D)   Waiving fees. The Village Administrator shall have the right to waive
staff cost or other costs if by doing so it benefits the village.
(Ord. 17-50, passed 10-2-2017)
§ 160.04 INVOICES.
   Copies of all invoices submitted to the village by its consultants shall be
provided to the petitioner. Any questions as to such invoices must be raised by
the petitioner within 14 days after transmittal of the invoices to the
petitioner, and in the absence of such questions within such time, the invoices
shall be conclusively deemed acceptable to the petitioner.
(Ord. 17-50, passed 10-2-2017)
§ 160.05 REFUNDS.
   Whenever it appears that there will not be further development costs
incurred relative to a petitioner, the balance in such petitioner's trust and
agency account will be refunded to the petitioner within 30 days.
(Ord. 17-50, passed 10-2-2017)
§ 160.06 COPY OF PROVISIONS TO PETITIONER.
   At the time that the amount of initial deposit is established, the
petitioner shall be provided with a copy of this chapter and shall deliver to
the village a signed statement acknowledging receipt of a copy of this chapter
and agreeing to make the required deposits.
