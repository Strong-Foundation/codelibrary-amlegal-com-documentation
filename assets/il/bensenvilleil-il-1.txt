      8.   Any other special ordinances not in conflict with the provisions of
this Code.
   B.   The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same in substance
as those of heretofore existing ordinances are continuations of such ordinances
and not new enactments. Any act done, offense committed, or right accruing or
acquired, or liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred prior hereto
shall not be affected, but may be enjoyed, asserted, enforced, prosecuted or
inflicted as fully and to the same extent as if the repeal had not been
effected. (1976 Code § 1.03; amd. 1981 Code)
1-2-2: ORDINANCES REPEALED NOT REENACTED:

amending such ordinance or ordinances in respect to such provisions only. (1981
Code)
1-2-4: COURT PROCEEDINGS:
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance,
whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense
committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising
under the former ordinance, or in any way whatsoever to affect any such offense
or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so
incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that proceedings thereafter shall conform to the ordinance in
force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new ordinance, such
provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied to any judgment
announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as abating any action now
pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the Village herein
repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code
shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same
provision; nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
Village under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this Village Code. (1981 Code)

Each section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause and provision of this

any reason, such decision shall not affect the remainder of this Code nor any

1-18-1: POLICY:
It is the policy of this ethics code to acknowledge and accomplish the
following:
   A.   The public judges its government by the way public officials and
employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or
appointed.
   B.   The public has a right to expect that every public official and
employee will conduct themselves in a manner that will tend to preserve public
confidence in and respect for the government represented.
   C.   Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public
official and employee, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or
appointed, will uniformly: 1) treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality,
fairness and equality under the law; and 2) avoid both actual and potential
conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.
   D.   The avoidance of such actual and potential conflicts between private
self-interest and the public interest can best be promoted if every public
official and employee, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or
appointed, will uniformly: 1) avoid the expenditure of public funds for
nonpublic purposes; that is, the expenditure of public funds by any and all
public officials and employees shall be for and in furtherance of only
recognized public purposes; and 2) avoid the expenditure of public funds
without supporting receipts therefor; that is, there shall be no expenditures
of public funds by any public official or employee without receipts accounting
for one hundred percent (100%) of such expenditures. Such obligations of honest
and truthful conduct and fair dealing are minimum requirements with which all
public officials and employees shall comply, and are in addition to any other
obligations required or imposed by law.
   E.   The best interests of the public require that any public official or
employee found to be in violation of this ethics policy shall be subject to
reprimand or other vote of no confidence, suspension, or discharge as provided
by applicable law, and, in addition thereto, the payment of a fine and, if
applicable, other reimbursement to the village in the event of such public
official's or employee's expenditure of public funds in violation of this
ethics policy.
   F.   The best interests of the public require that all public officials and
employees be obligated to report for investigation all alleged violations of
this ethics policy discovered in good faith. (Ord. 7-2003, 2-25-2003)

Commerce Commission, or such other appropriate governmental body or agency
having jurisdiction, and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the
electricity, and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or
partially nontaxable as a sale for resale.
            (1)   If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to
be an authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the
appropriate governmental body or agency for a resale number. Such person shall

additional information as the Village may reasonably require to demonstrate
that such person is not liable for the tax imposed by this Chapter on any
purchases of electricity. Upon receipt of such information, the Village shall
issue confirmation of such person's status as a reseller under this Chapter.
            (2)   The Village may revoke such person's status as a reseller
under this Chapter if the person fails to pay any tax payable under this
Chapter for electricity used or consumed by the person; if the number was
obtained through misrepresentation; and/or if the number is no longer necessary
because the person has discontinued making resales.
            (3)   If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or
consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed
pursuant to this Chapter directly to the Village as to the amount of
electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect and remit
said tax as to the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a
purchaser.
            (4)   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an
active resale number and complying with all other conditions of this Section
shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the
electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the
Village the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and such
other information that the Village may reasonably require. (Ord. 62-98, 9-8-

taxation by this State or any political subdivision thereof; nor shall any
persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing or
selling gas or electricity, or engaged in the business of transmitting messages
be subject to taxation under the provisions of this Section for such
transactions as are or may become subject to taxation under the provisions of

jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions hereof. (Ord. 62-98, 9-8-1998)
   C.   Such tax shall be in addition to the payment of money, or value of

compensation for the use of its streets, alleys or other public places, or
installation and maintenance therein, thereon or thereunder of poles, wires,
pipes or other equipment used in the operation of the taxpayer's business.

3-5-2: Compliance Required
3-5-3: License And Permit Required
3-5-4: Installation Regulations
3-5-5: Operation Regulations
3-5-6: Inspections
3-5-1: DEFINITION:
An "automatic dry cleaning machine", as the term is used herein, shall mean any
device or apparatus for the cleaning of clothes or fabrics, and designed to be
used or operated by any person but the owner, or an employee of the owner
thereof, which machine or device makes use of or contains perchlorethylene or
any other chemical solvent or substance which may cause harm to human beings by
reason of inhalation or contact. (1976 Code § 34.02)
3-5-2: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful to install, operate or maintain any automatic dry cleaning
machine except in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and the
regulations of the Illinois Department of Public Health relating thereto 1 .
(1976 Code § 34.01)
 
Notes
1 1. 65 ILCS 5/11-42-8.
3-5-3: LICENSE AND PERMIT REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful to install any automatic dry cleaning machine without
first having secured a permit therefor. Applications for such permits shall
contain full information as to the mechanical equipment of such machine and
provisions for ventilation for both the machine and the room in which the
machine will be located.
It shall be unlawful to engage in the business of maintaining any such machine
for use by the public upon payment of a fee without having first secured a
license therefor.
Permit and license fees are as set forth in Section
3-1-7 of this Title. (1976 Code § 34.03)
3-5-4: INSTALLATION REGULATIONS:
   A.   Each machine shall be completely enclosed by a cabinet and shall be
vented with the intake at the top and the outlet at or near the bottom of such
machine. Groups of machines may be entirely enclosed or supported on all open
sides by an enclosure topped with a hood vented as provided for each individual
machine.
   B.   The exhaust system must maintain a minimum flow of one hundred (100)
cubic feet per minute face velocity through the loading door whenever the door
is open.
Exhaust ventilation stacks from dry cleaning machines should be located as far
as possible from combustion air or drier air intakes.
   C.   The discharge stack for the machines and for the room in which the
machines are located shall extend at least two feet (2') above the level of any
window which can be opened located within fifty feet (50') of the outlet of the
stack, and shall be at least fifty feet (50') away from any fresh air intake
leading to any premises.
   D.   The machines must be so constructed as to prevent the loading door from
being opened during the normal cycle of operation. Each machine shall be
equipped with a transparent door or port to allow visual examination of the
status of the cleaning cycle.
   E.   Any connection of such machine with the water supply system must be
equipped with an air gap or vacuum breaker in the line upstream from the
condenser, with no control valves down stream from such gap or breaker. Waste
water shall be discharged through an air gap.
   F.   Each machine must be so designed and constructed as to prevent the
leakage of liquids, gas or vapors.
   G.   The solvent shall be stored in closed containers and should be
transferred from the containers in a line free of leaks. All storage facilities
for solvent, external from the equipment, must meet the requirements of the
Village fire inspectors.
Solvent control is to be such that under normal operation and use conditions no
solvent odor can be detected in the customer area.
Only the solvent specified by the equipment manufacturer shall be used.
   H.   Filter residue and other residues containing solvent shall be disposed
of so as not to create a health hazard or nuisance.
   I.   Respiratory protective equipment shall be provided for maintenance
personnel and must be kept in good repair and available for immediate use.
Chemical cartridge respirators are approved for light solvent concentrations
and the wearer should replace the cartridges immediately upon noting odor.
   J.   A utility fire extinguisher of either the carbon dioxide or dry
chemical type must be provided for use against electrical or oil fires.
   K.   Only the front or customer side of the dry cleaning machine should be
exposed in the customer area. The working or maintenance portion of the
equipment should be separated from the front of the machine by a solid
partition. As a means of minimizing any solvent build-up in the customer area
and also to control any minor solvent leakage, it is required that there be a
minimum flow rate from the customer area through the partition as follows:
 
No. Of Machines Minimum Flow Rate Per Machine (cfm)
1 - 3           500
4 - 8           400
9 - 16          375
17 or more      360
 
(Example: An 8 machine installation requires a minimum continuous exhaust flow
rate of 3,200 cfm.)
   L.   The exhaust ventilation as described above shall be provided on a
continuous basis while the store is open for business. The fan wiring shall be
such that the dry cleaning equipment cannot be operated unless the fan system
is in operation.
   M.   Where grille openings are to be installed in the partition to
facilitate air movement, they should be sized on the basis of about five
hundred (500) cfm per square foot of net grille area and should be placed as
close to the machines as possible. An example would be the use of a thirty inch
by six inch (30" x 6") grille located directly over a machine.
   N.   Access doors to the maintenance area shall be kept locked.
   O.   It is also required that a general ventilation fan be installed in the
back room or maintenance area to be used in case of serious solvent leakage.
This fan may be installed in the rear wall and when combined with the system
required in the minimum flow rate table above, should enable the exhausting of
a minimum of one thousand (1,000) cfm per machine.
   P.   A satisfactory means of preventing liquid leaks from escaping the
enclosure must be provided. This should include some method of "diking" the
floor of the enclosure or machine base to hold a liquid volume equal to the
maximum quantity of solvent which might possibly escape from the system. Some
means must be provided for draining solvent in the event of a leak and
containment. This can be done by gravity flow with the solvent transferred to a
standby holding tank. This tank should be vented to the outside.
   Q.   An interlock system must be provided on the machine to prevent the
loading door from being opened during the normal cycle. This system may be
either electrical and/or mechanical and so connected that in the event of a
power failure the machine fails safe.
   R.   A step by step instruction list must be posted in a conspicuous
location near the machine for customer use. Competent, trained maintenance
personnel must be available or on call as long as the premises are open for
business.
   S.   A solvent vapor sensing device within the tumbler is desirable to
control the drying cycle and to prevent the removal of solvent-laden garments.
   T.   The machine design must be such that essentially no solvent is retained
in the cleaned items upon completion of the dry cleaning cycle. A simple
performance test which must be satisfied is the lack of any solvent odor in a
closed automobile containing a newly cleaned load.
   U.   It is the responsibility of the proprietor to make certain that
clothing which cannot be properly cleaned and dried will not be placed in the
machines.
   V.   The machine should be checked daily and kept in good repair. All
maintenance personnel should be familiar with necessary machine repairs and
instructed as to the solvent hazards.
   W.   A supply of tempered (heated to 60° or 65° Fahrenheit) make-up air
equal to or greater than the total volume of air exhausted from the plant
should be provided in order to eliminate any negative pressure conditions which
might otherwise develop.
   X.   It is important that solvent-contaminated air even in very low
concentrations (5 - 20 ppm) be kept out of the air intakes of all combustion
equipment so as to minimize the thermal decomposition of the solvent. Break-
down products such as hydrochloric acid, free chloride and phosgene corrode
metal surfaces including flues and heater components and can seriously damage
cloth through acid burns or weakening of fibers. (1976 Code § 34.04)
3-5-5: OPERATION REGULATIONS:
   A.   No such automatic dry cleaning machine shall be operated unless all the
equipment described in the foregoing section is properly installed and in good
operating working condition.
   B.   No establishment for which a license is required under this Chapter
shall be open for business, and it shall be unlawful to admit the public or
customers into the room where such machines are located unless there is on duty
in the establishment at all times a competent person in charge of the
establishment, and in charge of the operation of such machines. There shall be
warning signs posted in places of easy observation warning of the dangers in
the event leakage of liquids, gas or vapor occurs. It shall be unlawful to
permit any residue containing solvent to flow into the sewer system of the
Village; tightly covered metal containers may be used for temporary storage of
such waste outside the building. Such containers shall bear labels indicating
the contents and dangers involved in handling, and shall be locked if in an
unenclosed place.
   C.   At least one legible sign shall be maintained in a place available to
customers giving the name, address and phone number of the owner of the
establishment, and of the service department or agency responsible for the
proper maintenance of the machines. (1976 Code § 34.05)
3-5-6: INSPECTIONS:
It shall be the duty of the Village President to cause such inspections to be
made as are necessary to see to the enforcement of the provisions of this
Chapter. (1976 Code § 34.06)

Only taxicabs in such numbers and of such kinds as are set forth on the
required metal sign may remain at a taxicab stand while waiting for employment,
and only in single file pointed in accordance with the traffic regulations. No
taxicab standing at the head of any such line shall refuse to carry any orderly
person applying for a taxicab who agrees to pay the proper fare, but this shall
not prevent any person from selecting any taxicab he may desire on the stand,

with passengers, those behind shall move up, and any taxicab seeking a space on
the stand shall approach the same only from the rear of the stand and shall

annually such inspection shall be performed and the meter sealed; provided,
however, that in the event complaint is made that any taximeter registers
improperly or inaccurately, it shall be the duty of the Chief of Police to
immediately have examined and inspected such taximeter. If such taximeter does

3-8-24-6: PROCEDURE FOR TESTING; DEMAND TESTS:

over a course of standard mile-in-length or by a mechanical test to prove the
accuracy of the register thereof. Either of the foregoing tests may be made at
the discretion of the Chief of Police.
In order to determine whether such taximeter correctly registers "waiting

with a light which shall be so reflected upon the dial of the taximeter as to
enable the passenger engaging and using such taxicab to read the figures
indicated thereon.
Every taximeter placed on a taxicab shall be so arranged that the dial thereof
is in plain view of the passenger while riding in such taxicab, or upon
alighting from the same. (1976 Code § 36.46)
3-8-24-10: FALSE SIGNALS:
No driver of a taxicab equipped with a taximeter, while carrying passengers or

fined not less than twenty five dollars ($25.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each offense. Conviction of a second violation during any
license period shall result in an automatic suspension of the pertinent license
for a period of thirty (30) days. The Board of Trustees, or any regularly
constituted board or commission appointed by the Board of Trustees, may, at a
public hearing during such thirty (30) day suspension period, permanently
revoke any license granted hereunder. The holding of such public hearing shall
be after not less than five (5) days' written notice to the licensee, and the
respondent in such hearing shall be afforded the opportunity to cross-examine
adverse witnesses and to present witnesses and evidence in his own behalf.

this Chapter, the nonexclusive right, privilege and franchise: to establish,
construct, operate, and maintain the system and system facilities in, upon,

the office of the Village Clerk. The company hereby agrees that the rates
contained in said Exhibit "1" which is on file in the office of the Village
Clerk will not be increased during a period of two (2) years after the system
is operational and cable television service is first offered to the residents
of the municipality. The system shall be deemed operational when seventy five
percent (75%) of street miles of cable have been installed in the municipality
and the system is able to provide audio and visual signals to subscribers.
   B.   The rates for all programming and services shall be nondiscriminatory
provided that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit reasonable
promotional rates which may, from time to time, be less than the standard rates

multiple occupancy structures, but no consumer shall pay more than the rates
set forth in Exhibit "1" adopted by reference and on file in the office of the
Village Clerk.
   C.   There shall be no charge for the connection or installation of basic
cable service or premium programming if ordered at one time within six (6)
months of the availability to an individual subscriber as determined by the
dated offer from the company to the individual subscriber. Any order for

performed without charge notwithstanding the actual date of installation. If an
individual subscriber shall not order installation within the said six (6)
month period, the company shall have the right to charge the installation fees
set on Exhibit "1" adopted by reference and on file in the office of the
Village Clerk.

may, without approval of the municipality, increase its rates for subscriber
services not more than once in any calendar year by such percentage as does not
exceed the increase in the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index

connection charges to the company at the time the installation is made
(subject, however, to the provisions of subsection
3-14-5C of this franchise).
   B.   Unless the company provides a longer time, subscribers shall pay
monthly in advance for systems services on or before the first day of the month
in which company is to provide services. (Ord. 38-82, 11-18-1982)

system for the report period.
   D.   Upon termination of the grant either at the expiration of its terms or
otherwise, the company shall continue to make semi-annual statements and
certifications and the annual report as provided in this Section until such
time as all payments of the municipality under this Chapter have been paid and
accounted for to the reasonable satisfaction of the municipality.

percent (5%) to any other municipality within Cook and/or DuPage Counties
(exclusive of the City of Chicago), under the same terms and conditions, the

The change in the percentage of franchise fee shall go into effect on the
effective date of the ordinance in the other municipality where the company
operates granting a franchise fee higher than five percent (5%).
To facilitate the implementation of this Section, the company shall, within
fifteen (15) days after their passage, send to the municipality notice of all

charge upon the property of the company its own equipment, including, but not

system facilities on or above public or private property, and an easement for

charges, upon the direction of the Village. The office shall have a listed
telephone and shall be open during reasonable business hours.

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

improper, the local tax administrator shall:

All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at
the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the vehicle, operated with the knowledge of the
owner, was used in commission of a violation of this section, the hearing
officer shall enter an order requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded
until the owner pays a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), plus
fees for the towing and storage of the vehicle. The penalty and fees shall be a
debt due and owing the village. However, if a cash bond has been posted, the
bond shall be applied to the penalty. If the hearing officer determines that
the vehicle was not knowingly used in such violation, the hearing officer shall
order the return of the vehicle or cash bond.

disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law. As used in this

4-8-12: AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM:
   A.   Violations: It shall be a violation of this chapter for a vehicle to
disregard a traffic control device or turn on red in violation of section 11-
306 of the Illinois vehicle code or a similar provision of the Bensenville
village code. An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law
enforcement system shall be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic
indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law
enforcement system.
   B.   Defenses: The following may be considered defenses by the hearing
officer for a violation of subsection A of this section:
      1.   That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of or in
the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;
      2.   That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when
the light was red either: a) in order to yield the right of way to an emergency
vehicle or b) as part of a funeral procession.
      To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were
stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or
possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit
proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates
was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
   C.   Notice Of Violation: When the automated traffic law enforcement system
records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in violation of subsection A
of this section, the village shall issue a written notice of violation to the
registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S.
mail within thirty (30) days after the Illinois secretary of state notifies the
village of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and
in no event later than ninety (90) days following the violation. The village
shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor
provides the lessee's name by an affidavit and a copy of the lease within sixty
(60) days of the notice's issuance. If the driver information is not provided
within sixty (60) days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. If any
notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a second notice shall be
sent to the last known address recorded in a United States post office approved
database of the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall
be made by first class mail, postage prepaid.
      A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation
shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the traffic
compliance administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the
motor vehicle was being operated in violation of subsection A of this section,
or whether one of the defenses enumerated in subsection B of this section is
visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image
captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall
be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above.
The traffic compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all violation
notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the
vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts
contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a
violation of the above noted statutory and local provisions and shall be prima
facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses
established in this section.
      The notice of violation shall include the following information:
      1.   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the secretary of state, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States post office approved database;
      2.   The make (only if discernable) and registration number of the motor
vehicle involved in the violation;
      3.   The violation charged;
      4.   The location where the violation occurred;
      5.   The date and time of the violation;
      6.   A copy of the recorded images; (Ord. 12-2008, 3-18-2008)
      7.   The amount of the civil penalty and the date by which the penalty
should be paid (14 days from the date of issuance), if a hearing is not
requested, and a statement that the payment of the fine shall operate as a
final disposition of the violation; (Ord. 45-2011, 7-19-2011)
      8.   A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date
noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or
lessee;
      9.   The amount of the late fee;
      10.   A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will
result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension
of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle;
      11. A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie evidence
of a violation;
      12. A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine
or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing; and
      13. A statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested. (Ord.
12-2008, 3-18-2008)
   D.   Hearing: The owner of a vehicle being operated in violation of
subsection A of this section may request a hearing by the "respond by" date on
the notice of violation (14 days from the date of the issuance), to challenge
the evidence or set forth an applicable defense. The notice of violation shall
constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in
any proceeding alleging a violation of subsection A of this section. The notice
of violation shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal
on the basis of the defenses established in subsection B of this section.
      The owner's failure to appear at the hearing will result in a finding of
liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a "findings, decision and
order" letter will be sent to the owner. The owner's failure to pay the amount
by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination.
(Ord. 12-2008, 3-18-2008; amd. Ord. 45-2011, 7-19-2011)
   E.   Nonresidents: Where the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle
is not a resident of the village but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged
violation, such person may contest the charges using the same available
defenses as stated above, but rather than attend the administrative hearing,
they may submit any and all documentary evidence to the traffic compliance
administrator no later than the hearing date, together with a written statement
reflecting that they are nonresidents of the village. The traffic compliance
administrator shall forward all timely submitted materials to the hearing
officer for review and determination.
   F.   Final Determination: A final determination of violation liability shall
occur following failure to pay the fine, a failure to request a hearing by the
respond by date, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability
and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review
procedures provided by the village code. Where a person fails to appear at a
hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a
prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination shall become final
upon failure to pay the amount owed on the date provided in the "findings,
decision and order" letter. Appeal may be made to the circuit court of DuPage
County on any final determination as provided for by the administrative review
act. (Ord. 12-2008, 3-18-2008)
   G.   Notice Of Determination Of Liability: If the registered owner fails to
pay or contest the notice of violation within fourteen (14) days, a notice of
determination of liability will be sent to the owner indicating that a fine in
the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is due to the village. The notice
will also state that the owner can petition the village to set aside the
determination of liability before it becomes final. If the owner does not pay
the one hundred dollars ($100.00) as specified in the notice or petition the
village to set aside the determination within thirty five (35) days, a notice
of final determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the owner has
exhausted all challenge options and the one hundred dollar ($100.00) fine is a
debt due and owing to the village and must be paid within fourteen (14) days.
The owner will also be notified that the failure to pay the one hundred dollar
($100.00) fine within fourteen (14) days will result in a late fee of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) added to the original fine. (Ord. 45-2011, 7-19-2011)
   H.   Notice Of Final Determination: A notice of final determination shall be
sent following the final determination of automated traffic law violation
liability and the conclusion of judicial review. The notice of final
determination shall include the following information:
      1.   A statement that the unpaid fine is a debt due and owing to the
village;
      2.   Warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the village
within fourteen (14) days may result in a petition to the circuit court of
DuPage County to have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment or may result in
the suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines or
penalties for five (5) or more violations of subsection A of this section.
   I.   Petitions To Set Aside Determination: A petition to set aside
determination of an automated traffic law violation must be filed with or
mailed to the traffic compliance administrator within fourteen (14) days of the
date of mailing of the notice of determination of liability. The grounds for
the petition are limited to:
      1.   The person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the
date the violation notice was issued;
      2.   The person having already paid the fine for the violation in
question.
      Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of
liability, the hearing officer shall review the petition to determine if cause
has been shown to set aside the determination. If cause has been shown, the
village shall forward the petitioner a new hearing date on which the petitioner
must appear to present his case. The village shall notify the petitioner of the
hearing officer's decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within
fourteen (14) days of the village's receipt.
   J.   Notice Of Impending Driver's License Suspension: A notice of impending
driver's license suspension shall be sent to the person liable for any fine or
penalty that remains due and owing on five (5) or more violations of subsection
A of this section. The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall
state the following information:
      1.   The failure to pay the fine owing within forty five (45) days of the
notice's date will result in the village notifying the secretary of state that
the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under section
6-306.5 of the Illinois vehicle code;
      2.   A statement that the person may obtain a copy of the original ticket
imposing a fine by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the village
along with a request for the copy.
      The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent by
first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the secretary
of state or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the
last known address recorded in a United States post office approved database.
(Ord. 12-2008, 3-18-2008)
   K.   Driver's License Suspension: The traffic compliance administrator, by
certified report, shall request that the secretary of state suspend the driving
privileges of an owner of a registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine
or penalty due and owing as a result of five (5) automated traffic violations.
The report shall be certified and contain the following: (Ord. 45-2011, 7-19-
2011)
      1.   The name, last known address as recorded with the secretary of
state, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or
as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent
under this chapter is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of
the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number of
any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;
      2.   The name of the municipality making the report pursuant to this
section; and
      3.   A statement that a notice of impending driver's license suspension
has been sent to the person named in the report at the address recorded with
the secretary of state or at the last address known to the lessor of the cited
vehicle at the time of the lease or, if any notice sent under this chapter is
returned as undeliverable at the last known address recorded at a United States
post office approved database; the date on which such notice was sent; and
address to which such notice was sent.
      The traffic compliance administrator shall notify the secretary of state
whenever a person named in the certified report has paid the previously
recorded fine or penalty or whenever the municipality determines that the
original report was in error. A certified copy of such notification shall also
be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein.
      Any person receiving notice from the secretary of state that their
driving privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period may
challenge the accuracy of the certified report prepared by the traffic
compliance administrator. The person shall, within seven (7) days after having
received notice from the secretary of state, request an opportunity to speak
with the traffic compliance administrator to challenge the accuracy of the
certified report. If the traffic compliance administrator determines that the
original report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the
report was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has
already paid their fine for the five (5) or more automated traffic violations,
the traffic compliance administrator shall immediately notify the secretary of
state of such error in a subsequent certified report.
   L.   Penalty: Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a uniform
traffic citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, any person
violating subsection A of this section shall be fined one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each offense if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated
traffic law enforcement system. Failure to pay the original fine within
fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the notice of final determination shall
result in an additional one hundred dollar ($100.00) late payment fine.
      A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section is
not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and
may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle. (Ord.

penalty of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) or incarceration for a period
not exceeding the maximum time allowed pursuant to Section 1-2-9 of the
Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-9).
   G.   As a substitute for any monetary penalty assessed pursuant to

garbage, from the campsite after the person was informed that the person was in
violation of this chapter.
   J.   A separate offense of this chapter shall be deemed committed on each

      2.   The Illinois vehicle code, 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/15-102
through 5/15-116, as amended from time to time setting forth the maximum limits
of vehicle size, weight and load and applicable violations and penalties shall
govern the maximum limits of vehicle size, weight and load of vehicles moving

strobe light or lights, mounted on the rear of the load and of sufficient
intensity to be visible at five hundred feet (500') in normal sunlight.
   F.   Enforcement: The village of Bensenville police department is directed

maintenance of which the village is responsible.

company or individual making the movement.

load to be moved by such vehicle or combination is composed of a single
nondivisible object that cannot reasonably be dismantled or disassembled.
      5.   For the purpose of over length movements, more than one object may
be carried side by side as long as the height, width, and weight laws are not
exceeded and the cause for the over length is not due to multiple objects.

provisions of this section shall be void at issue and any movement made

      11.   In any prosecution for a violation of this section, when the
authorization of an excess size or weight permit is at issue, it is the burden

nondivisible.
   H.   Special Permit Application:

for a village special permit in the form it prescribes that is signed by an

village of Bensenville police department or other designated representative and

along with the fee and the stipulated dimensions, weights, conditions and
restrictions authorized and this record shall be presumed correct in any case
of questions or dispute.

(2) axle single vehicle registered by the secretary of state with axle loads
not to exceed thirty five percent (35%), on a three (3) or four (4) axle
vehicle registered by the secretary of state with axle loads not to exceed
twenty percent (20%), and on a five (5) axle vehicle registered by the
secretary of state not to exceed ten percent (10%) above those provided in the

however, may not exceed the maximum gross weight of the registration class of
the vehicle allowed under the Illinois vehicle code section 3-815 or 3-818 as
amended from time to time.
   I.   Special Permit Issuance; Conditions; Violations And Penalties:
      1.   Every special permit shall be in written form and carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any village police or enforcement officer or authorized agent of
the village granting the permit and no person shall violate any of the terms or
conditions of such special permit.
      2.   Violation of the terms and conditions of the special permit shall
not be deemed a revocation of the permit; however, any vehicle and load found
to be off the route prescribed in the special permit shall be held to be
operating without a permit.
      3.   Any off route vehicle and load shall be required to obtain a new
permit or permits, as necessary, to authorize the movement back onto the
original permit routing.
      4.   Nothing provided in this section shall be construed to authorize any
village police officer or authorized agent of the village to remove the special
permit from the possession of the permittee unless the permittee is charged
with a fraudulent permit violation as provided in this subsection and the
Illinois vehicle code. However, upon arrest for an offense of violation of a
special permit, operating without a special permit when the vehicle is off
route, or any size or weight offense under this section when the permittee
plans to raise the issuance of the special permit as a defense, the permittee,
or his agent, must produce the special permit at any court hearing concerning
the alleged offense.
      5.   If the permit designates and includes a routing to a certified
scale, the permittee, while en route to the designated scale, shall be deemed
in compliance with the weight provisions of the permit provided the axle or
gross weights do not exceed any of the permitted limits by more than the
following amounts:
 
Single axle 2,000 pounds
Tandem axle 3,000 pounds
Gross       5,000 pounds
 
      6.   When escort vehicles are required, they shall meet the following
requirements:

properly licensed to operate the vehicle.
         b.   Vehicles escorting oversized loads more than twelve feet (12')
wide must be equipped with a rotating or flashing amber light mounted on top as
specified under the Illinois vehicle code section 12-215.
      7.   Violation of any rule, limitation or condition or provision of any
special permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this section shall
not render the entire permit null and void but the violator shall be deemed
guilty of violation of the special permit and guilty of exceeding any size,
weight or load limitations in excess of those authorized by the special permit.
      8.   The prescribed route or routes on the special permit are not mere
rules, limitations, conditions, or provisions of the special permit, but are
also the sole extent of the authorization granted by the special permit. If a
vehicle and load are found to be off the route or routes prescribed by any
special permit authorizing movement, the vehicle and load are operating without
a special permit. Any off route movement shall be subject to the size and
weight maximums, under the applicable provisions of this section.
      9.   Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made under a fraudulent
special permit it shall be void, and the person, firm, or corporation to whom
such permit was granted, the driver of such vehicle in addition to the person
who issued such permit and any accessory, shall be guilty of fraud and either
one or all persons may be prosecuted for such violation. Any person, firm, or
corporation committing such violation shall be guilty of a class 4 felony and
the village shall not issue special permits to the person, firm or corporation
convicted of such violation for a period of one year after the date of
conviction. Penalties for violations of this section shall be in addition to
any applicable penalties as provided in the Illinois vehicle code as amended
from time to time.
      10.   Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made in violation of a
special permit issued in accordance with this section, the person to whom such
permit was granted, or the driver of such vehicle, is guilty of such violation
and either, but not both, persons may be prosecuted for such violation. Any
person, firm or corporation convicted of such violation shall be guilty of a
petty offense and shall be fined for the first offense, not less than fifty
dollars ($50.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) and, for the
second offense by the same person, firm or corporation within a period of one
year, not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more than three hundred
dollars ($300.00) and, for the third offense by the same person, firm or
corporation within a period of one year after the date of the first offense,
not less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and the village shall not issue special permits to the
person, firm or corporation convicted of a third offense during a period of one
year after the date of conviction for such third offense.
      11.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the village,
with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may at its discretion
authorize the movement of a vehicle in violation of any size or weight

hearing officer determines that there is no such probable cause, the vehicle
shall be returned without penalty or other fees.

to this Section, the Village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt
requested, the owner of record of the date, time and location of a hearing that

persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If,
after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of
evidence that the vehicle, operated with the knowledge of the owner, was used
in commission of a violation of this Section, the hearing officer shall enter
an order requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays
a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), plus fees for the towing and
storage of the vehicle. The penalty and fees shall be a debt due and owing the
Village. However, if a cash bond has been posted, the bond shall be applied to
the penalty. If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not
knowingly used in such violation, the hearing officer shall order the return of
the vehicle or cash bond.

5-7-7: OPERATION OF TOW LIST:
If the owner or operator of a vehicle is present at the scene of the vehicle,
is not under arrest, and does not abandon his or her vehicle, and in the public
safety officer's opinion the vehicle is not impeding or obstructing traffic,
illegally parked, or posing a security or safety risk, the public safety
officer will allow the owner or operator of the vehicle to specify a tow
operator to relocate the vehicle. If the owner or operator chooses not to
specify a tow operator, the department shall select the tow operator from the
tow list. The department may call a tow operator not on the tow list if the tow
operator on said list is unavailable. In the event of an emergency, a public
safety officer or the department, taking into account the safety and location
of the situation, may obtain towing service from any source deemed appropriate.

5-7-9: REMOVAL FROM TOW LIST:
   A.   Removal From Tow List: The Police Chief or the Police Chief's designee
may remove any tow operator temporarily or permanently from the tow list when
he finds:
      1.   Placement on the tow list was secured by fraud or concealment of a
material fact, which if known would have caused disapproval of the application;
      2.   The tow operator has violated any one or more of the provisions of
this chapter or State Statute related to towing services or operation of its
business;
      3.   The service provided by the tow operator has been substantially
inadequate, which shall include, but not be limited to, failing to be available
for or not accepting calls, slow response time, excessive damage claims,
repeated complaints from citizens, or unsafe or inadequate towing equipment; or
      4.   The tow operator is in violation of any term or condition of the
written agreement described in section
5-7-3 of this chapter or said agreement has expired or has been otherwise
terminated.
   B.   Temporary Removal: If the removal of the tow operator from the tow list
is temporary, such temporary removal shall not be for more than thirty (30)
days at any one time.
   C.   Pending Removal: If the Police Chief determines the alleged offense
does not constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the
public, the Police Chief shall provide the tow operator with written notice at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the temporary or
permanent removal by delivering said notice to the tow operator's place of
business on record with the Village. Said written notice shall include: 1) the
effective date of the removal; 2) whether the removal is temporary or
permanent; 3) the allegations which form the basis of the removal; 4) the
actions, if any, the tow operator may take to prevent the removal from
occurring; and 5) the procedure which the tow operator must follow to request a
hearing to appeal the removal. If a hearing is requested, the Village Manager,
or the Village Manager's designee, shall act as the Hearing Officer. The
hearing shall be informal and provide both sides with the opportunity to
present all evidence relevant to the removal. The Hearing Officer shall issue a
written decision based upon a preponderance of the presented evidence within
seven (7) business days of the hearing. The written decision will be sent to
the tow operator's business address on record with the Village, with a copy
retained in the tow operator's application file at the department. The Village
or the tow operator may contest the decision of the Hearing Officer in any
manner provided by law.
   D.   Immediate Removal: If the Police Chief determines that a tow operator
presents an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the community,
or if the tow operator has not provided proof of valid insurance in the amounts
required by ordinance, the Police Chief may, in his sole and absolute
discretion, remove the tow operator from the tow list prior to any hearing. If
the Police Chief finds just cause, he shall provide written notification to the
tow operator that the tow operator is being removed from the tow list
immediately. Said written notice shall be delivered to the tow operator's place
of business on record with the Village on the first day the removal is
effective, and shall state: 1) that the removal is effective immediately; 2)
whether the removal is temporary or permanent; 3) the allegations forming the
basis of the removal; and 4) the procedure which the tow operator must follow
to request a hearing to appeal the removal. If a hearing is requested, the
Village Manager, or the Village Manager's designee, shall act as the Hearing
Officer. The hearing shall be informal and provide both sides with the
opportunity to present all evidence relevant to the removal. The Hearing
Officer shall issue a written decision based upon a preponderance of the
presented evidence within seven (7) business days of the hearing. The written
decision shall be sent to the tow operator's business address on record with
the Village, with a copy retained in the tow operator's application file at the
department. If the decision reverses the removal, the Hearing Officer shall
notify the department so that towing privileges may be reinstated as soon as
possible. The Village or the tow operator may contest the decision of the
Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
   E.   Method Of Requesting Hearing: A tow operator shall request a hearing by
filing a written request for hearing with the Office of the Village Manager
within ten (10) business days of receiving a notice of removal. Upon receipt of
a written request for hearing, the Village Manager shall afford the tow
operator such hearing, which hearing shall commence at a date and time within
three (3) Village business days of the date of the Village Manager's receipt of
the written request for hearing. If the tow operator is unavailable at the time
provided by the Village, the Village shall not be bound by the three (3)
Village business day time period, and the removal will not be stayed. If the
Village is unable to provide a hearing time within the applicable time period,
all action on the removal shall be stayed until the hearing.
   F.   Tow Operator Removed: In the event a tow operator is removed from the
tow list for a reason other than expiration of the above mentioned written
agreement with the Village, the Police Chief in his discretion shall either
select a new qualified tow operator for inclusion on the tow list from the
applications previously submitted during the application period described in
section 5-7-2 of this chapter or seek new applications for a qualified tow
operator during a special application period. The tow list established under
this subsection shall be in effect until July 31 unless sooner terminated under
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 30-2019, 4-17-2019)

been requested by the department or the owner or operator, the public safety
officer, unless acting under 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-1431, shall

of-way where oil or grease has been deposited by the disabled vehicle being
serviced.
   B.   No tow operator or driver of a tow truck shall respond to a call for
service while under the influence of intoxicants.
   C.   Towed vehicles shall be taken to such location designated by the
vehicle owner, driver or agent, should such person not wish to store the
vehicle at the tow operator's facility; provided, however, that vehicles towed
upon the direction of the department shall be towed to such a place as
designated by the public safety officer in charge at the scene.
   D.   Once notified of a tow, the tow operator will provide the department an
approximate time it will take to arrive at the scene of the tow. If a tow

twenty four inches (24") must be maintained around all vehicles towed through
use of the tow list. (Ord. 30-2019, 4-17-2019)

et seq., or of any offense listed in 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/4-203.5,
shall be approved as a tow operator to be placed on the tow list, nor shall any
tow operator knowingly permit such a person to operate a vehicle on tow list
calls.
Each tow operator shall furnish to the department a complete and current list
of all drivers who may respond to tow list calls. No driver shall be permitted
to respond to any tow list call unless his name, date of birth and driver's

department.
   C.   Notice: Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a

officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by
the village. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer
shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle, or any
person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, of the fact of the impoundment, and of the vehicle owner's right to

   D.   Preliminary Hearing: If the owner of record of a vehicle impounded
pursuant to this section desires to appeal the impoundment, said owner must
make a request for hearing within twenty four (24) hours of the impoundment.
Said request shall be in writing and filed with the chief of police, or his
designee, who shall conduct such preliminary hearing within twenty four (24)
hours after receipt of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or village

heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of
evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible
only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in
the conduct of their affairs. If after the hearing, the chief of police, or his
designee, determines there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is
subject to impoundment pursuant to this section, he shall order the continued
impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the
vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and pays the tower any applicable towing and storage fees. If
the chief of police or his designee determines that there is no such probable
cause, the vehicle will be returned without penalty or other fees. (Ord. 66-

   E.   Hearing: Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is impounded pursuant to

The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the village
manager. The owner will appear at the plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty
or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, the cause will be disposed of at
that time. If the owner pleads not guilty, a hearing shall be scheduled and
held, unless continued by the hearing officer, no later than forty five (45)
days after the vehicle was impounded. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the
hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct
witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of
evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent

the evidence, that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set
forth in this section, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for an
administrative fee in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and
requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the
administrative fee to the village plus fees to the tower for the towing and
storage of the vehicle. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing,
the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village. If the
hearing officer finds no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall
order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees.
   F.   Administrative Fee: If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to
this section, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing the village. If a
cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied
to the fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a fee is imposed, the
village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment
against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this
section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the fee is paid to the
village and any applicable towing fees are paid to the tower, in which case
possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled
to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to
satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative
fee and other applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after an
administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by
failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and
applicable fee are not paid within thirty (30) days after the expiration of
time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may
be sought, or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking administrative
review has been resolved in favor of the village, whichever is applicable, the
vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois
vehicle code.
   G.   Vehicle Possession:
      1.   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien
holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a
vehicle impounded under this section until the administrative fee and fees
applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person with a
lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure
proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or
she agrees in writing to refund the village the amount of the net proceeds of
any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of
record, not to exceed the administrative fee, plus the applicable fees.
      2.   For purposes of this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle is
the record titleholder as registered with the secretary of state of the state
of Illinois.
   H.   Administrative Review: Any owner, lien holder or other person with a
legal interest in the vehicle, who is not satisfied with the decision of the
hearing officer, shall have the right to appeal the decision to the circuit
court, pursuant to the administrative review act, as set forth fully in 735
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq. (Ord. 66-2006, 12-18-2006)

6-6-6: POTENTIAL AIR POLLUTING EQUIPMENT:
   A.   Installation Permit: No person shall construct, install or alter any
fuel burning, combustion, or process equipment or any equipment pertaining
thereto for use within the incorporated areas of the Village until an
application, including suitable plans and specifications of the equipment and
structures or buildings used in connection therewith has been filed in
duplicate by the person or his agent in the office of, and has been approved
by, the pollution control officer and an installation permit has been issued by
the building inspector for such construction, installation or alteration.
   B.   Plans And Specifications: The abovementioned plans and specifications
shall show the form and dimension of the fuel burning, combustion or process
equipment, more particularly the proposed boiler, furnace, fuel burner, stack,
ducts, drains and sewer connections, together with the description and
dimensions of the building or part thereof in which such equipment is to be
located. The character of the fuel to be used, the maximum quantity of such
fuel to be burned per hour, the character and concentration of liquid wastes,
the operating requirements, and the use to be made of the equipment shall be
stated.
   C.   Examination Of Application For Permit: Whenever an application is filed
with the pollution control officer, he shall thereupon examine and either
approve or reject same; and in the event of approval, he shall notify the
building inspector to issue the permit.
   D.   Exceptions: An installation permit is not required:
      1.   In the case of routine maintenance work or minor alterations or
repairs which do not adversely affect the production, emission or discharge of
smoke, dust, fly-ash, soot, fumes, solid or gaseous products of combustion,
solid or liquid waste products; or
      2.   In the case of an emergency repair where serious consequences would
otherwise result, provided that application for the necessary installation
permit is filed otherwise in accordance with this Section on the first business
day following commencement of the repair work.
   E.   Proof Of Responsibility; Bond: If the proposed plans and specifications
submitted pursuant to this Section are not sufficiently complete, in the
judgment of the pollution control officer, to show that the equipment or device
for which such plans and specifications were submitted can consistently comply
with and can be operated within the provisions of this Chapter, either because
the design or process is unconventional or untried, or because the person has
elected to omit confidential details, or because there is insufficient data on
which to estimate the air pollution potential, the pollution control officer is
authorized to require as a condition precedent to the issuance of an
installation permit or certificate of operation, proof of financial
responsibility and of ability to make any changes that may be required after
construction to insure compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. Such
proof, in the discretion of the pollution control officer, may be a written
statement to such effect, signed by the owner or a responsible officer of a
financially sound organization, or a written guarantee of performance signed by
a responsible supplier or contractor or other responsible person. The
responsibility of any such person or soundness of any such organization shall
be a matter within the judgment of the pollution control officer, subject to
the right of appeal.
In the event that he is not given adequate proof of financial responsibility
and of ability to make any changes that may be required, the pollution control
officer may require any such person, as owner, lessee, operator, supplier,
contractor, vendor or other person, to file with the pollution control officer
a surety bond running to the Village in the sum of not to exceed fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000.00), executed by such person, as principal, and two (2) or
more sureties, or a surety company authorized to do business in this State.
   F.   Commencement Of Work: If construction, installation or alteration is
not started within one year of the date of the installation permit, the permit
shall become void and all fees shall be forfeited. An extension not to exceed
six (6) months may be granted by the Board of Trustees through appeal
procedures upon proper application.
   G.   Operating Permit: After any work of erecting, constructing,
reconstructing, installing, altering or repairing any fuel burning equipment is
completed, the pollution control officer shall inspect the same, and, if such
work conforms to the application, plans and specifications filed in respect
thereof and to the provisions of this Chapter, he shall authorize the issuance
of a permit known as an operating permit, to the person to whom the necessary
installation permit was issued, upon payment of the prescribed fee. The
operating permit shall be posted in a conspicuous position adjacent to the
equipment.
   H.   Subsequent Violation: The authorization of the issuance by the
pollution control officer of any installation permit or operating permit shall
not be held to exempt the person to whom the permit has been issued or who is
in possession of the same, from prosecution for violation of this Chapter.
   I.   Annual Inspections; Notice To Correct Defects: Equipment installed
under this Section shall be inspected annually by the pollution control
officer. If, at the time of the annual inspection, it is found that the
equipment is in such condition that it cannot be operated within the provisions
of this Chapter, the pollution control officer is authorized to give notice in
writing to the person owning, operating or in charge of such equipment of the
defects found and an order to correct, repair or replace the defective
equipment. Failure to comply with this order within thirty (30) days from its
date shall be a violation of this Section and the pollution control officer is
hereby authorized to seal the equipment. No person shall violate the seal on
any equipment that has been sealed at the direction of the pollution control
officer unless authorized by him in writing to do so.
   J.   Variances: The Village Board of Trustees is hereby given authority for
the granting of individual variances for any fuel burning, combustion or
process equipment or device, beyond the limitations prescribed in this Chapter
whenever it is found, upon the presentation of adequate proof, that compliance
with any provision of this Chapter, or any rule, regulation, requirement or
order of the pollution control officer will result in an arbitrary and
unreasonable taking of property or in the practical closing and elimination of
any lawful business, occupation or activity, in either case without a
sufficient corresponding benefit or advantage to the people in the reduction of
pollution; in such case, there shall be prescribed other and different
requirements, not more onerous, applicable to plants or equipment involved.
   K.   Period Of Grace: In the event any person is compelled to, or deems it
advisable to, install any new equipment, processes or devices, appliances,
means or methods, including needed pollution control equipment, in order to
comply with any provisions of this Chapter, such person may obtain a period of
grace in order to effect such compliance in accordance with the following
procedure. To obtain such period of grace, a written request shall be filed
with the pollution control officer by any such person, and shall set forth
that, following normal good operating procedures, it is impossible in the
operation of any plant, fuel burning, combustion or process equipment or
devices, or apparatus, to operate the same in compliance with the requirements
of this Chapter. The request shall also state evidence satisfactory to the
pollution control officer that such person has taken, or will take, all steps
necessary to provide for future compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.
The pollution control officer shall be assured that the acquisition and
installation of the proper equipment, processes, devices or appliances or
control equipment will be effected within the period of time specified. (1976
Code § 15.05)
6-6-7: AIR POLLUTION EMISSION STANDARDS:
   A.   Established: Air quality standards are ambient air quality goals
established for the purpose of protecting public health and welfare. The levels
of air quality designated by the standards are designed to protect against
injury to human, plant or animal life; they are further intended to allow
maximum enjoyment of property consistent with the intent of this Chapter.
      The first use of air resources is to sustain life. Air entering the
respiratory tract must not menace health. Therefore, the air quality standards
set must, as a minimum, provide air which will not adversely affect, through
acute or chronic symptoms, the health of the community.
      The air quality standards set here will provide a basis for planning to
achieve cleaner air. Even though in certain areas of the Village the quality of
the air may be lower than the standards, they are not a license allowing
unnecessary degradation of the air, going against the intent of the act which
requires a maintenance of the purity of the air resources of the State.
      The standards have also been designed for use as a basis for the
development of implementation plans for the abatement and control of pollutants
emissions from existing sources including development of air contaminant
emission limitations and the setting of long- and short-range objectives for
reduction of total emission of air contaminants as determined by emission
inventories. And they will be used in the determination of air pollution
control emission limitations for future installations to insure that urban and
economic growth trends do not add to community air pollution problems.
   B.   Burning Restrictions:
      1.   Open Burning: No person shall cause, suffer, allow or permit open
burning of refuse or other matter. (1976 Code § 15.06)
      2.   Bonfires: No person shall kindle or maintain any bonfire or
authorize any such fire to be kindled on any private land unless a permit is
issued by the pollution control officer or by the fire inspector of the
Village. Exempt from the provisions of this subsection are fires used in the
preparation of foods. (Ord. 25-91, 9-17-1991)
   C.   Air Contaminants Prohibited; Ringelmann Test: A person shall not
discharge into the atmosphere from any single source of emission any air
contaminants for a period or periods aggregating more than three (3) minutes in
any one hour which is:
      1.   As dark or darker in shade as that designated as No. 1 on the
Ringelmann Chart; or
      2.   Of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal
to or greater than does smoke described in subsection C1 of this Section.
   D.   Nuisance, Air Contaminants: A person shall not discharge from any
source such quantities of air contaminants or other material which cause
injury, detriment, nuisance or annoyance to any other person or to the public
or which endanger the comfort, repose, health or safety of any such persons or
the public or which cause or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage
to business or property. (1976 Code § 15.06)
6-6-8: SULFUR DIOXIDE LIMITATION:
   A.   No person shall cause or permit the use of, or if intended for use in
the Village, the purchase, sale, offer for sale, storage or transportation of
fuel which, as determined by the methods of the American Society for Testing
and Materials, contains more than the following percentages of sulfur by
weight:
      For a period of two (2) years, beginning April 5, 1971: fuel 2.5%.
      For a period of eighteen (18) months, beginning April 5, 1973: fuel 2.0%.
      After October 5, 1974: fuel 1.5%.
   B.   Upon the application of any person engaged in the operation of fuel
burning equipment, the pollution control officer, with the approval of the
Board of Trustees, may issue a certificate of operation in those cases wherein
the applicant shall establish that the fuel burning equipment is operated in
such a manner or is equipped with such control apparatus, as to continually
prevent the emission of any sulfur compound or compounds in amounts greater
than those that would be emitted from the burning (in the same fuel burning
equipment without such control apparatus) of fuel containing any amount of
sulfur by weight not in excess of the maximum amount permitted at the
applicable time by this Section. (1976 Code § 15.07)
6-6-9: TOXICS:
No activity or operation shall cause, at any time, the discharge of toxic
matter into the atmosphere in such concentrations as to be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety or welfare, or cause injury or damage to
property or business or be needlessly destructive of any insect, plant or
animal life which contributes to the general welfare. (1976 Code § 15.11)
6-6-10: TESTS:
   A.   If the pollution control officer has reasonable cause to believe that
any equipment or fuel is in violation of this Chapter, the pollution control
officer may order the owner or lessee of the equipment or fuel, or his agent to
conduct and pay for such tests as are necessary in the opinion of the pollution
control officer to determine whether the equipment or fuel is in violation of
this Chapter and to submit the test results to the pollution control officer
within ten (10) days after the tests are completed.
   B.   Such tests shall be conducted in a manner approved by the pollution
control officer. If any part of the test is conducted at a place other than the
site where the equipment or fuel is located, that part of the test shall be
certified by a responsible laboratory.
   C.   The owner or lessee, or his agent, shall notify the pollution control
officer of the time and place of a test at least seven (7) days before the
commencement of a test. Reasonable facilities shall be made available for the
pollution control officer to witness the test. (1976 Code § 15.12)
6-6-11: FEES:
Fees required for permits, certificates and inspection of equipment and other
sources of emission shall be established by resolution of the Village President
and Board of Trustees. All fees shall be collected by the Village Clerk for
deposit with the Village Treasurer. (1976 Code § 15.13)
6-6-12: PERSONS LIABLE:
All persons owning, operating or in charge or control of any equipment who
violate or cause, suffer or allow any violation of this Chapter, either as
owners, occupants, managers or agents, shall be jointly and severally liable to
the penalties imposed by this Chapter. (1976 Code § 15.14)
6-6-13: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates any of the provisions of or who fails to perform any
duty imposed by this Chapter, or who violates any terms or orders of the
pollution control officer promulgated pursuant to this Chapter, shall be liable

constructing a new wastewater source and connecting it the POTW of the village.
All review, inspection and connection fees shall be based upon current fees
identified in Section 8-8-6-17 of this chapter and
8-7-6 of the village code and shall be reviewed and updated annually.
   A.   A review and connection fee for sewer permit shall be paid to the
village at the time the residential application is filed. Non-residential,
commercial and industrial fees, will be based on an individual case basis
measured by the impact on the current facility and current POTW capacity. A
minimum sewer connection fee shall be established for any non-residential -
commercial and industrial users based on water line size or for additions at 4
population equivalents (PE). The first inspection that is required for a
service is covered by the review fee.
   B.   An inspection fee shall be paid for any additional inspections. This
includes but is not limited to inspections of sampling manholes, common
interceptors, flow metering or sampling equipment, garbage grinders, grease,
oil and sand interceptors, and grease interceptors. A separate review fee may
be charged based on the cost and expense to review equalization and/or
pretreatment facilities required at a non-residential user.
   C.   Connection Fees Involving Extra Strength Wastewater:
      1.   PE Determination:
         a.   The director of public works may require non-residential
commercial and industrial sewer users to report to the director of public works
concentrations and flow rates of waste water discharged to the village
collection system. Flow rate averages will be calculated based on the number of
actual days discharged. For wastewater the strength of which exceeds normal
residential wastewater for any constituent, as defined in Section
8-6-18 of this chapter, the fees shall be based as follows.
            (1)   In the event that the wastewater exhibits a ratio of COD to
BOD that is greater than 3.0, the BOD PE will be calculated on the basis of
0.33 of the COD value.
            (2)   A permit connection fee then will be charged on the basis of
the impact on a treatment works as the equivalent of the highest PE of the
three (3) parameters: Flow, BOD or TSS. Upon payment, any increase in PE will
be added to the baseline PE of the property.
         b.   When the volume and strength of the wastewater to be discharged
to the public sanitary sewers is not known at the time of the connection, the
fee shall be estimated and adjusted to reflect actual conditions during the
billing period after a full year of operation of all equipment.
         c.   The volume and strength of the wastewater for fee purposes shall
be based on the maximum actual daily discharge of constituents.
         d.   When a connection is made based on the applicant's statement that
the strength of the wastewater does not exceed normal domestic wastewater in
any constituent, and normally at the end of the billing period after a full
year of operation of all equipment, it is determined that the wastewater does
exceed domestic wastewater in strength, the director of public works and
director of community and economic development may accept or reject the wastes
and back-charge the applicant for fees plus applicable penalties for the extra
strength waste or have the service disconnected and the premises closed.
         e.   The director of public works may review non-residential users
flow and loadings on an intermittent frequency, normally every two (2) years,
to identify increases to the baseline PE. The director of public works and
director of community and economic development may bill the non-residential
user, for increases to the baseline, a connection fee as defined in Section
8-7-6 of the village code. On payment of the fee, the property baseline shall
be adjusted to the newly established PE.
   D.   Properties Outside Corporate Limits: The connection fees for any user
not located within the corporate limits of the village are listed in Section
8-7-6 of the village code. On payment of the fee, the property baseline shall
be adjusted to the newly established PE. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-3-5: USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   A.   It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged to any
facility served by the village, without having first complied with the terms of
this chapter. At minimum, all users are subject to the prohibited discharge
standards in Section
8-6-5-2, change notification in Section
8-6-9-6 and hazardous waste notification in Section
8-6-9-9 if applicable. Spill prevention containment and countermeasures / slug
control planning may also be necessary for some non-residential users as
identified in Section
8-6-6-5.

foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected
directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-3-6: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   An inspection fee as provided in Section
8-6-3-4 shall be paid to the village prior to issuance of the permit should it
be determined that the user is required to install any of the following
structures:
      1.   Sampling Manhole Requirements: All users located in areas zoned
industrial and/or business park and such other users as required by the
director of public works, except residential users, are required to install a
monitoring manhole for each separate discharge in the building sewer in
accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the director of
community and economic development. Each manhole shall be situated on the
user's premises in an easement dedicated to the village.
      The sampling manhole shall be located on the sewer connection pipe at a
point where there are no changes in grade or alignment for at least fifteen
(15) pipe diameters upstream and downstream from the manhole. The grade (slope)
of the pipe shall not exceed one percent (1%) (one foot per one hundred feet
(100')) through the manhole and for a distance of fifteen (15) pipe diameters
upstream and downstream from the manhole.
      There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The manhole shall be
installed and maintained by the owner/user at his sole expense so as to be safe
and accessible to the village at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to
claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
         a.   Where such a manhole location would be impractical or cause
extreme hardship on the user, the director of public works may concur with the
manhole being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that
the manhole is located so that it shall not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles. In those cases where a sampling manhole must be in a parking
lot, a permanent barricade, such as a vertical pipe shall be placed around the
manhole to prevent vehicles from driving or parking over the manhole cover.
         b.   The director of public works and director of community and
economic development may postpone the installation of the sampling manhole when
specific circumstances prevent the installation of a manhole.
         c.   A postponement for a sampling manhole will be handled on a case-
by-case basis by the director of public works and director of community and
economic development when it is determined that the discharge is solely from a
residential source and the site is not in a zoned business park/industrial
area.
         d.   When a postponement for a sampling manhole installation is
granted by the village, an affidavit will be signed by the property owner to
install the manhole at a later date should business practices change at the
location where the manhole installation was postponed.
         e.   The director of public works may determine sub-classes of
business that need not install monitoring manholes and will advise the director
of community and economic development of such sub-classes. Monitoring manholes
will always be required in zoned business or industrial parks.
      2.   Liquid Quantity Measurements: All significant industrial users may
be required to install an open channel flow measuring device in said sampling
manhole. When required, the sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus or
Parshall flume or equivalent, unless a weir or similar device is approved by
the village.
      The village may, at its option, based on the water usage and/or waste
loadings, require the user to install a device with a recording and totalizing
register for measurement of the liquid quantity. The device shall include a
circular chart recorder, suitable to record seven (7) calendar days of flow.
The equipment required to indicate, record and totalize the flow shall be
located in a warm dry location and be accessible to the village for reading.
This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at his sole
expense. Should the requirement be made, the user shall complete installation
of the flume and secondary flow measuring device based on the installation
schedule approved for such device by the village.
      The user shall be required to calibrate and maintain the flow metering
equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures and
frequencies. Users who operate flow measuring devices will submit the procedure
for operation and maintenance (O & M) to the village. The user shall further
document O & M in a log which shall be available for inspection by village
personnel. At minimum, the user shall submit a semi-annual calibration report
performed by an outside representative by the deadline defined in the user's
discharge permit. The user may be required to submit flow records to the
pretreatment coordinator monthly.
      3.   Sampling Equipment: The village may, at its option, based on water
usage and/or waste loadings or when the waste loads cannot be accurately
evaluated by time composite samples, require the user to install sampling
equipment. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at his
sole expense.
   Users shall submit the procedure for operation and maintenance to the
village. The user shall further document O & M in a log which shall be
available for inspection by village personnel. At minimum, the user shall
submit an annual report confirming the accurate operation of the equipment
performed by an outside representative by the deadline defined in the discharge
permit. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)

fee will be required at the time of the filing as defined in Section
8-6-17 of this chapter. Waiver requests are not considered to be filed until
the request has been reviewed and determined complete. If the director of
public works fails to act on a completed waiver request within forty five (45)
calendar days, a request for waiver shall be deemed to be denied. While waivers
may result in an alteration of the grease interceptor requirements, it does not
waive the requirement to prevent prohibitive discharges through alternate
technologies and best management plan practices.
      1.   Existing External Food Service Establishment Grease Interceptor
Installation Waiver: The requirement to install and to properly operate and
maintain a grease interceptor is conditionally stayed, that is, delayed in its
implementation by the director of public works. Terms and conditions for
application of a stay to a food service establishment shall be set forth in a
permit. The terms may include the requirement to install grease interceptor(s)
inside the facility, alternate technology and the use of best management
practices. The waiver will not apply to any existing facility that has not
operated as a food service establishments for the last twelve (12) consecutive
months prior to the adoption of this chapter. Such facilities will be required
to install a grease interceptor in order to operate a food service
establishment in the village sanitary sewer service area.
      2.   Common Grease Interceptor Waiver: Common grease interceptor means
one or more interceptors receiving fats, oils and grease laden wastewater from
more than one establishment. Common interceptors may be used in lieu of an
individual grease interceptor at each food service establishment provided a
waiver has been granted by the director of public works. A common grease
interceptor may be located at shopping centers, malls, entertainment complexes,
sporting arenas, hotels, multi-tenant "flex" spaces, mixed use spaces, and
other sites where multiple establishments are connected to a single grease
interceptor. The owner of the property on which the common grease interceptor
is located shall be responsible for operating and maintenance of the common
interceptor including program documentation, upkeep, and repair. In such cases,
a general permit will be issued to the property owner for the common grease
interceptor and separate general permits will also be required at each food
service establishment connected to the common grease interceptor for best
management practices requirements.
      3.   Limited Food Preparation Establishments Grease Interceptor
Installation Waiver: Waivers for installations at food service establishments
only serving beverages and snack bars with no food preparation other than food
warming will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the director of public works
and are deemed to be limited food preparation establishments.
      4.   Constraint Waivers At Existing Food Service Establishments: Where
the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent
alternative pretreatment can be installed, a waiver from the installation of
the grease interceptor requirement may be granted. The director of public works
determination to grant the waiver will be based upon, but not limited to,
evaluation of the following conditions:
         a.   There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of
a grease interceptor;
         b.   There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between the kitchen
plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease
interceptor and the private collection lines or public sewer; or
         c.   A waiver from grease interceptor installation cannot be granted
to allow alternative pretreatment technology that is, at least, equally
effective in controlling the fats, oils and grease discharge in lieu of a
grease interceptor.
      If a constraint waiver is granted, the director of public works will
institute the grease disposal mitigation fee as defined in Section
8-6-17 of this chapter.
      5.   Alternate Technology Waiver: The use of automatic grease removal
systems is permissible only upon the written approval of the director of public
works and the lead plumbing inspector of the village. Approval of the device
shall be based on demonstrated (proven) removal efficiencies and reliability of
operation. The village may approve these types of devices dependent on
manufacturer's specifications on a case by case basis. Any user operating an
alternative technology may be subject to additional operational requirements.
Any user with this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that
attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the
unit's outlet, is consistent achieved as required by the director of public
works. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-3-9: SEWER LINE MAINTENANCE/REPLACEMENT:
   A.   The residential property owner is responsible for the maintenance of
the private sewer line from their structure to the public sanitary sewer
connection. It shall be the responsibility of the village to repair a broken or
collapsed building sanitary sewer service line from the private property line
to the point of connection with the public sanitary sewer. Evidence (via
videotape) of a broken/collapsed building sanitary service must be provided to
the village to justify a repair in the public right-of-way. Root infiltration
is not considered a broken or collapsed service. The final determination of a
break or collapse in the sewer service will be given by the director of public
works (or his/her designee).
   B.   The non-residential property owner is responsible for the maintenance
and repair of the private sewer line from their structure to the sanitary sewer
connection.
   C.   In the event the property owner finds it necessary to excavate the
private sewer line for maintenance or replacement, that shall be the property
owner's responsibility.
   D.   In those instances when property owners have had to excavate and as a
result the sidewalk, curb and street have been dug out, the property owner will
be responsible for the restoration of the street (surface and sub-surface),
curb and sidewalk.
   E.   In those instances where Subsection D. is involved, it is recommended
tunneling under the curb and sidewalk whenever practical. Sidewalk and curb
must be cut when removal is required.
   F.   All work, as it is related to the replacement and/or repair of the
private sewer line, shall be in conformance with the village standard
construction specifications and will be inspected by a duly authorized agent of
the village during the repair and replacement.
   G.   The village may, in case of emergency, repair or order the repair of
any sanitary sewer service from the village main to the premises served
thereby, and if it does so, the cost of such repair work located on private
property shall be repaid to the village by the owner or occupant (who are
jointly and severally liable). These costs shall be treated and collected in
the same manner and with the same remedies as for the collection of charges for
water and sewer service. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)

year in a manner secured and coordinated by the pretreatment coordinator.
Additionally, any property involved in the repair or servicing of automobiles,
trucks, or engine-powered equipment shall install a triple basin oil separator
in the sanitary line (per State of Illinois plumbing codes) servicing the
repair area of the building. This system shall be cleaned, serviced and
inspected at least four (4) times per year by the owner at his expense. The
property may petition the pretreatment coordinator to reduce the cleaning and
servicing of the triple basin oil separator to two (2) times per year upon
demonstration that the amount removed quarterly is significantly less than
twenty five percent (25%) rule for the basin capacity and the discharge does
not exceed the oil and grease local limit. Conversely, the system may be
required by the pretreatment coordinator to be cleaned at a more frequent rate
if the property cannot meet the requirements.
   B.   When property use involves automotive repair or handling, sale and
dispensing of petroleum products and/or automotive fluids, there shall be a
separate drainage system constructed to collect all fluids from the areas
associated with pump islands and under pump canopies. This separate drainage

POTW to be in violation of its NPDES permit(s), or to cause the village's POTW
to violate receiving stream water quality and/or general effluent discharge
standards;
      27.   Any wastewater causing the POTW effluent to fail a toxicity test;
or
      28.   Any substance which may cause the village's POTW effluents or bio-
solids, to be unsuitable for reclamation and re-use, or interfere with the
reclamation processes. In no case shall a substance discharged to the village's
POTW cause the village to be in noncompliance with any bio-solids use or
disposal regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; or any regulations
affecting bio-solids use or disposal developed pursuant to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, Solids Waste Disposal Act, Toxic Substance
Control Act, or any state or local Standards applicable to any bio-solid
management methods either being used, or considered by the village.
      29.   Any waste containing items that could clog or damage the village's
sanitary sewers, pump stations or POTW operation including but not limited to
the following items: disposable wipes, personal care wipes and products,
antibacterial wipes, feminine care products, diapers, baby wipes, wet/dry
cleaning cloths, rags, paper towels, napkins, string, zip ties, laundry dryer
sheets, and any plastic products.
   D.   Wastes prohibited in this section shall not be processed or stored in
such manner that they could be discharged or introduced to the POTW. All users
with prohibited wastes described in this section or those that have hazardous
wastes as defined in Section
8-6-9-9 shall develop and implement a spill prevention/slug control containment
and countermeasures plan consistent with the requirements in Section
8-6-6-5. The pretreatment coordinator may also determine spill prevention/slug
control is required of liquids and solids not previously described on either
list based on an evaluation of a site potential to cause spills or slug loads
to be introduced to the POTW. Notice requirements shall be permanently posted
as provided in Sections
8-6-6-5 and
8-6-9-7.
   E.   Requirements Of Polluted Discharges - Discharge Locations:
      1.   Discharge Of Polluting Substances From Fixtures Into Storm Sewers
Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person or user to connect or cause to
be connected, any drain carrying, or to carry, any toilet, sink, basement,
septic tank, cesspool, industrial waste, or any fixture or device discharging
polluting substances, to any storm sewer or storm water drainage system within
the corporate limits of the village.
      2.   Discharge Of Sanitary And Industrial Waste Into Storm Drainage
Systems Prohibited, Nuisance Declared. For reasons of the protection of the
health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the village, is the declared
policy of the village to prohibit sanitary and industrial waste from entering
into the storm water drainage system, and any such connection to the storm
water drainage system is determined to be injurious to the public health and
welfare and is hereby declared a public nuisance.
      3.   Prohibited Discharges Into Natural Outlets. It shall be unlawful to
discharge into any natural outlet within the village or in any area under the
jurisdiction of the village, any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes or other
polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in
accordance with subsequent provisions of this chapter and the required permits
have been obtained and is in compliance with the Clean Water Act.
   F.   Requirements Of Unpolluted Discharges:
      1.   Discharge Of Sump Pumps: A sump pump or sump pumps must discharge
into a storm sewer system; or with the prior written permission of the director
of public works may discharge outside a building in an area first approved by
the director of public works. A shut-off value or similar device which can
divert the unpolluted discharge from the sump pump into the sanitary sewer
system, rather than into the storm system, or vice versa, shall not be
constructed or installed, and any construction or installation of same shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter. It shall be prima facie evidence of a
violation of this chapter if any person or user has on his premises or under
his control a sump pump, or any other pump, fixture, or gravity drain connected
to the sanitary sewer system which would allow the flow of unpolluted water
into the sanitary sewer system.
      2.   Discharge Of Unpolluted Drainage Into Storm Sewers Or Natural
Outlets: Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural
outlet approved by the director of public works. Industrial cooling waters or
unpolluted process waters may be discharged, upon approval by the director of
public works and the IEPA if appropriate, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
Discharges are required to be in compliance with the Clean Water Act.
      3.   Discharge Of Unpolluted Discharges Upon Adjacent Property Or Public
Streets Or Ways Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person or user to
discharge any stormwater, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, or
subsurface drainage, including the use of a sump pump for such purpose in such
manner as to cause waters to overflow onto adjacent property or to be
discharged upon any public street or public way. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-3: NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
These pretreatment requirements shall apply to all non-residential users
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, promulgated by the
USEPA in accordance with Section 307(b) and (c) of the Act, currently
discharging or scheduled to discharge to the village. The national categorical
pretreatment standards, found in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405 -
471 are hereby incorporated into this chapter. Limits in categorical
pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from the process regulated
by the standard or as otherwise specified by the standard. Compliance with
national categorical pretreatment standards is mandatory.
   A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with paragraphs B. and F. below and 40 CFR 403.6(c) unless
specifically restricted by the categorical pretreatment standard. These
equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements
are deemed pretreatment standards. Users shall be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived. An alternative pretreatment
limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical
detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants.
   B.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production, the pretreatment
coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either
as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes
of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users (see 40 CFR
403.6(c)(2)).
      The village calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall
calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the
user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be
based not upon the designed production capacity, but rather upon a reasonable
measure of the user's actual long-term daily production during a representative
year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected
production.
      The village calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall
calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average
daily flow rate of the user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily
flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-
term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the
representative year.
   C.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the pretreatment
coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters
to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance
of an alternative limit.
   D.   A user may request a variance from categorical pretreatment standards
from USEPA based on fundamentally different factors. The request must comply
with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
   E.   A user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   F.   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the village convert the
limits to equivalent mass limits (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(4)). The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
pretreatment coordinator. The village may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 1.a. through 1.e.
below.
      1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must:
         a.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its
individual wastewater discharge permit;
         b.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         c.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
         d.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to
control the discharge; and
         e.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for
equivalent mass limits.
      2.   A user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         a.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         b.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         c.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more
than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
subsection 1.c. of this section. Upon notification of a revised production
rate, the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and
revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility;
and
         d.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 1.a. of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      3.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the pretreatment
coordinator:
         a.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         b.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
         c.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
8-6-5-2.B. The user must be in compliance with Section
8-6-16-3 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   G.   The pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment
coordinator.
   H.   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived. Note: see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7).
   I.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four (4)-day average, limitations.
Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure
shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent
limitations. Note: see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8).
   J.   Any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the pretreatment coordinator with two (2) business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the pretreatment
coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate. Note: see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9).
All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are
required to file reports as required in this chapter, signed by an authorized
representative per Sections
8-6-9-2 and
8-6-9-3. These reports shall include all information that the village deems
necessary to make compliance determinations. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-4: STATE LIMITS:
   A.   All users are subject to state standards and requirements as defined in
35 Ill Adm. Code (IAC) 307. Specifically, the standard for discharge of mercury
is as follows:
      1.   Mercury (35 IAC 307.1102)
         a.   Except as provided below, no person shall cause or allow the
concentration of mercury in any discharge to a publicly owned or publicly
regulated sewer system to exceed the following level, subject to the averaging
rule contained in 35 IAC 304.104(a):
 
CONSTITUENT STORET NUMBER CONCENTRATION mg/1
Mercury     71900         0.0005
 
         b.   It shall be an exception to subsection a. if the discharge is to
a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which is required to meet a
limitation less stringent than the 0.0005 mg/l mercury concentration in which
case the discharge limitation shall be the same as that applicable to the
publicly owned or regulated sewer system to which it discharges.
         c.   It shall be an exception to subsection a. if all the following
conditions are met:
            (1)   The discharger does not use mercury; or, the discharger uses
mercury and this use cannot be eliminated; or, the discharger uses mercury only
in chemical analysis or in laboratory or other equipment and takes reasonable
care to avoid contamination of wastewater; and,
            (2)   The discharge mercury concentration is less than 0.003 mg/l,
as determined by application of the averaging rules of 35 IAC 304.104(a); and,
            (3)   The discharger is providing the best degree of treatment
consistent with technological feasibility, economic reasonableness and sound
engineering judgment. This may include no treatment for mercury; and,
            (4)   The discharger has an inspection and maintenance program
likely to reduce or to prevent an increase in the level of mercury discharges.
         d.   The discharge of wastes from medicinal or therapeutic use of
mercury, exclusive of laboratory use, shall be exempt from the limitations of
subsection a. if all the following conditions are met:
            (1)   The total discharge is less than 227 g (one half pound) as
mercury (Hg) in any year;
            (2)   This discharge is to a public sewer system; and
            (3)   The discharge does not, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, causes the effluent from the sewer system or treatment plant to exceed
0.0005 mg/l of mercury.
         e.   No person shall cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a
publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which, alone or in
combination with other sources, causes a violation by the sewer treatment plant
discharge of the water quality standard of 35 IAC 302 for mercury applicable in
the receiving stream.
         f.   For purposes of permit issuance the IEPA may consider application
of the exception of subsection b. or c. to determine compliance with this
section. The IEPA may impose permit conditions necessary or required to assure
continued application of the exception. When subsection b. or c. applies, the
IEPA may impose an effluent limitation in the permit which allows the discharge
of a concentration of mercury greater than 0.0005 mg/l but not more than 0.003
mg/l. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-5: LOCAL LIMITS:
The following pollutant limits are established to protect against potential
problems, interference and pass through.
   A.   Non-Toxic Pollutants:
 
POLLUTANT                       CONCENTRATION
(Total unless otherwise listed) Instantaneous Daily Maximum (mg/l)
Oil and Grease                  200
 
   B.   Toxic Pollutants: No user shall discharge any wastewater containing
concentrations greater than the daily maximum local limits as set forth below
into any sewers that connect either directly or indirectly to the POTW.
POLLUTANT CONCENTRATION (mg/L)
          Instantaneous Daily Maximum
POLLUTANT             CONCENTRATION (mg/L)
                      Instantaneous Daily Maximum
Arsenic                             2.0
Cadmium                            0.5
Chromium                           15.5

Cyanide               0.5            
Lead                               2.0
Mercury (see Section               0.0005
8-6-5-4)
Nickel                             0.6
Silver                             3.9
Zinc                               2.1
 
   C.   In the event that a suitable sampling manhole does not exist as per
Section
8-6-5-7 and no end-of-process discharge location exists, the "sampling
facility" shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
   D.   Food Service Establishment Twenty Five Percent (25%) Requirement. The
last section of an external grease interceptor at an food service establishment
shall be measured to determine that the total volume of the grease interceptor
being used for any food-derived solids to settle or accumulate plus the
floatable grease-derived materials that rise and accumulate, identified as a
solids blanket and grease cap respectively, is less than twenty five percent
(25%) of the total design hydraulic depth as measured from the effluent
discharge pipe to the bottom ("Twenty Five Percent (25%) Requirement").
      1.   The village will apply the twenty five percent (25%) requirement
above normally at the discharge side of the external grease interceptor if
multiple compartments exist, prior to mixing with any other wastewater from the
contributing food service establishment's property.
      2.   The village reserves the right to apply the action level for
discharge at an end-of-pipe discharge location that connects to the public
sewer system in the event that a unique sampling location in the end
compartment of the grease interceptor is not available or there is no external
grease interceptor.
      3.   The village also reserves the right to apply said action level to
the discharge in the next sanitary sewer manhole downstream of the facility in
the event that there is neither a grease interceptor sampling location nor a
sampling manhole at the site.
      4.   The village may also apply the twenty five percent (25%) requirement
for external grease interceptor that are used in non-food service establishment
locations such as an automobile service, repair and dispensing properties.
   E.   The village will apply the local limits found in Sections
8-6-5-5 A. and B. above normally at the end-of-pipe point where the non-
residential waste is discharged to the municipal sewer system. The village
reserves the right to apply said local limits at an end-of process discharge
location that connects to the POTW sewer system in the event that a unique
sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is not available to sample or the sample is
being taken from a batch discharge so that it is more representative of the
impact the discharge will cause to the POTW.
   F.   The village reserves the right to establish requirements, by ordinance
or in a wastewater discharge permit or general permit, to require control over
the quantities and rates of discharge from any user.
   G.   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in a
wastewater discharge permit, mass limitations rather than concentration
limitations on discharges particularly if users are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   H.   The village reserves The right to set specific limits for those
pollutants not identified in Sections
8-6-5-5 A. or B. on a case by case basis for impacts caused to the POTW
including but not limited to interference, potential problems, pass through and
prevention of beneficial bio-solid re-use. Those limits shall be set forth in a
wastewater discharge permit per Section
8-6-8 of this chapter.
      1.   Local limits for additional pollutants not identified in Sections
8-6-5-5 A. or B. will be noticed to the permit holder a minimum of thirty (30)
days prior to the effective date of the wastewater discharge permit. In the
event that the village receives written comment on said limit during the
comment period, the limit will take effect within sixty (60) days of the public
notice date to allow review and comment by the village.
   I.   The village may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
local limits and the requirements of Sections
8-6-5-2 and
8-6-5-3 or to implement other provisions of this code.
   J.   Any user discharging pollutants such as but not limited to: oils and
grease, BOD or TSS to the village's facilities That cause the village to alter
its method of wastewater treatment or bio-solid disposal to a more costly
method shall be assessed the differential cost between the more costly method
of treatment and the less costly method of treatment. Such costs shall only be
assessed upon approval of the village board.
   K.   Any user, whose discharge is pretreated by the village pursuant to the
village's determination that such pretreatment is more effective and which
discharges pollutants into the village's facilities so as to necessitate the
village's alteration of its method of wastewater treatment or bio-solid
disposal to a more costly method, shall be assessed the differential cost
between the more costly method of treatment and the less costly method of
treatment. Such costs shall only be assessed upon approval of the village
board.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020; amd. Ord. 26-2025, 6-24-2025, eff. 5-1-2025)
8-6-5-6: RIGHT OF REVISION:
   A.   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits or general permits, more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter. The specific limitations on discharge listed in Section
8-6-5-5 are derived from the maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL)
calculation. The maximum allowable industrial loadings are allocated only to
those industrial users, at the village's discretion, that contribute the
regulated pollutant and all remaining industrial users are held to either the
background concentration or slightly higher than background but lower than the
specific discharge limit. In no case shall the total of all allocations exceed
the maximum allowable industrial loading.
   B.   The village will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks
pollutant loading for each pollutant for new industries or increase with
existing industries. The village will recalculate the maximum concentrations
from time to time using site specific data taking into consideration revisions
to state and federal regulations that may impact the calculations. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-7: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   Sampling Manhole Applicability:
      1.   All non-residential users are required to install a sampling manhole
for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with the plans
and specifications approved by the village and Section
8-6-3-6.
         a.   When required by the village, a significant industrial user or
non-significant regulated user that does not have a unique sampling chamber at
end-of-pipe, shall install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use as
the regulation location of local limits in the building sewer in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by the village. This sampling chamber
may be required to be installed within the building.
         b.   When required by the village, a categorical industrial user shall
install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use as the regulation
location of the categorically regulated discharge in the building sewer in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village. This sampling
chamber may be required to be installed within the building and may be in
addition to an end-of-pipe manhole.
      2.   The village reserves the right to apply said local limits in Section
8-6-5-5 at an end-of process discharge location that connects to the POTW sewer
system in the event that:
         a.   A unique sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is not available;
         b.   A more representative sample can be taken of a process batch
discharge even though an end-of-pipe manhole exists;
         c.   A more representative sample can be taken at the end-of-process
location than the end-of-pipe location as a result of impacts from dilute
wastestreams;
         d.   An end-of process location is used because the industrial user is
unable to provide adequate flow documentation to use a combined wastestream
formula.
      3.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist, the
"sampling manhole" shall be considered to be either the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected or the point of process wastewater discharge if accessible by the
village.
   B.   Wastewater Monitoring And/Or Flow Measurement Facility Operation and
Maintenance:
      1.   Such facilities will be installed and maintained at all times at the
user's expense. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that the sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge. Installation will be consistent
with the requirements of Section
8-6-3-6.
      2.   The manhole or chamber located on a building sewer discharge located
in dedicated easements shall be easily accessible to representatives of the
village twenty four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.
      3.   The manhole or chamber at a discharge location within the building
shall be accessible to representatives of the village during normal user
operating hours.
      4.   Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if it
is substantiated to the village that the metered water supply and wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
village is made in the metered water supply to determine wastewater flow which
is documented through the use of sub-meters and/or production records. In the
event that the wastewater flow cannot be substantiated at any regulated
location, the user will be required to install flow monitoring consistent with
Section
8-6-3-6.
      5.   The sampling chamber, flow metering device, sampling equipment and
documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analysis of
samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection by the village.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-8: MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: At minimum, all significant industrial users including
categorical industrial users as well as non-significant regulated users are
required to sample based on the village monitoring frequency as stated in the
wastewater discharge permit. Other users are required to sample upon the
request of the village. The users shall pay the costs of sampling of its
discharge and the costs of analyses of its samples, whether or not the sampling
and analyses are done by the user or by the POTW.
   B.   Frequency:
      1.   All significant industrial users including categorical industrial
users with wastewater discharge permits must sample their effluent consistent
with the permit requirements and report the results to the POTW at least twice
yearly. The village may specify more frequent reporting, quarterly or monthly,
dependent of the frequency for those parameters specified in the user's permit
and the village monitoring frequency defined in the village enforcement
response plan. The significant industrial user may have the village conduct
routine monitoring using an independent laboratory. Sampling visits of this
type will normally be unannounced.
      2.   Any non-significant regulated user with an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall sample their effluent and report the results
to the POTW consistent with the requirements of the Wastewater discharge permit
and the village monitoring frequency. The non-significant regulated user may
have the village conduct routine monitoring using an independent laboratory.
Sampling visits of this type will normally be unannounced.
      3.   Hauled waste and batch discharges that have been approved by the
pretreatment coordinator will have sampling and analysis performed as defined
by the pretreatment coordinator.
      4.   The village shall have the right to perform its own sampling at any
time at any location. Village data will be used for all surcharge evaluations.
      5.   The village may initiate sampling and analyses at a greater
frequency as a result of a violation of any discharge permit limit, including
cases where sanitary sewer area of concern maintenance issues or blockage to
the sanitary sewer system has occurred. Cost of additional sampling and
analyses for any monitoring event will be invoiced to the applicable user
through the village water and sewer invoice system.
      6.   The village may resample a food service establishment within thirty
(30) calendar days when a violation of the twenty five percent (25%)
requirement as defined in Section
8-6-5-5 D. is identified.
   C.   Sample Collection:
      1.   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the entire sampling and reporting period as defined
in the wastewater discharge permit.
      2.   Except as indicated in Subsections C.3. and C.5. below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques.
      3.   In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
pretreatment coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling at
minimum collecting samples every fifteen (15) minutes during a twenty four
(24)-hour workday; or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. A proportional number of samples shall be collected for
wastewater discharges less than twenty four (24) hours.
      4.   Single grab samples may be required in the event of an infrequent
batch discharge or to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      5.   Samples for fats, oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
hexavalent chromium, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be
obtained using the number of grab samples necessary To assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Multiple
grab samples are required for reports identified in Sections
8-6-9-2.A and
8-6-9-2.C as defined. Multiple grab samples that are individually preserved as
specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate USEPA guidance that are collected
during a twenty four (24)-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis,
as follows:
         a.   For, cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, and sulfides:
multiple grab samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
         b.   For volatile organics and oil and grease: multiple grab samples
may only be composited in the laboratory.
      6.   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
village, as appropriate.
   D.   Cost: The cost of village sampling and analyses for any monitoring will
be invoiced to the applicable user. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-9: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part
of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the pretreatment coordinator or other parties approved by USEPA. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-5-10: PROTECTION OF VILLAGE SAMPLING AND FLOW METERING EQUIPMENT FROM
DAMAGE:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which
is owned or contracted by the village. Any person violating this provision
shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. (Ord.
4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-6: GENERAL DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE:
8-6-6-1: APPLICABILITY:
Each user that discharges non-residential source waste shall provide wastewater
treatment and best management practices as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section
8-6-5 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by USEPA, the
state, or the pretreatment coordinator, whichever is more stringent. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-6-2: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
   A.   Any pretreatment facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment
coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the pretreatment coordinator
before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
village under the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements.
Users shall obtain all necessary construction-operating permits from the IEPA
prior to the village connection and/or Discharge permit(s) being issued. IEPA
will make the determination of actual permitting requirements based on changes
in the wastewater volume or characteristics generated at the user site. The
village will track and parallel this IEPA permitting process. No sources of
non-residential wastewater will be allowed to discharge to village POTW until
all permitting requirements have been satisfied. Such pretreatment facilities
shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater
operator.
   C.   Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to the village and IEPA prior to the user's
initiation of the changes. Users shall obtain all additional construction-
operating permits from IEPA and the village for the changes prior to discharge.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-6-3: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
At minimum, the village may require the additional pretreatment measures
defined below. The village reserves the right to make unannounced inspections
of any additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours whether
the user has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
or not.
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the pretreatment coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may require any person or user discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow.
The village may issue an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
solely for flow equalization.
   C.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   D.   Grease Interceptor Maintenance: A grease interceptor located inside an
food service establishment will be inspected and cleaned weekly. A grease
interceptor located outside an food service establishment on its property shall
be inspected and the grease cap and solids blanket minimally cleaned every
three (3) months; the entire contents of the trap cleaned annually; and the
grease interceptor repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense.
Logs of inspection and cleaning are to be posted in a readily accessible
location of the facility. It shall be the responsibility of the food service
establishment to inspect its grease interceptor during the pumping procedure to
ensure the trap is properly cleaned out and that all fittings and fixtures
inside the trap are in working condition and functioning properly. In the event
that actual operations of the grease interceptor fail to produce results that
consistently prevent prohibitive discharges, as defined in Section
8-6-5-2, or fail to meet local limits, as defined in Section
8-6-5-5, the owner of the food service establishment will be required by the
director of public works to have the grease interceptor cleaned at a more
frequent rate or install or modify pretreatment as necessary.
   E.   Grease Interceptor Cleaning Cycle Waiver: The grease interceptor owner
or operator may petition the pretreatment coordinator to reduce the cleaning
and servicing of the grease interceptor from every three (3) months to a
maximum of every six (6) months upon demonstration that the amount removed
every three (3) months is significantly less than the twenty five percent (25%)
requirement for the basin capacity, as defined in Section
8-6-5-5 D., and that the discharge does not exceed the oil and grease action
level at a downstream sampling location. The grease interceptor owner or
operator will be required to submit data sufficient to document to the
pretreatment coordinator that the twenty five percent (25%) requirement can be
maintained using a longer cleaning cycle. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-6-4: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP) PLAN:

prevent adverse impacts and confirm that said procedures are being performed on
a regular basis. At minimum, logs are required to verify valves in containment
structures, if present, are closed.
   C.   Review of such plans and operating procedures by the village shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility or spill
plan as necessary to meet all requirements of this chapter. Review by the
village does not constitute an approval of a spill plan and the village and its
designee(s) are not to be construed as responsible for the actions of the user
and any impacts the user may cause as a result of a spill or slug load.
   D.   At least once every two (2) years the pretreatment coordinator shall
evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a revision to its spill
plan. The pretreatment coordinator may require any user to submit at a
frequency less than two (2) years such spill plan or require modification of an
existing spill plan based on changes that have occurred at the site or in
response to an incident that had the potential to impact the POTW.
   In alternate years, the pretreatment coordinator shall evaluate whether each
non-significant regulated user is required to file a revision to its spill plan
based on changes that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident
that had the potential to impact the POTW. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-6-6: CLOSURE PLAN:

      1.   Authority: Pursuant to 40 CFR Part 403.12(e)(2)(v) and (vi), the
village may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user.
This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are derived
from mass standards or production based standards. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         b.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
         c.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      2.   Application Requirements:
         a.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         b.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with Section
8-6-7-6, and include the certification statement in Section
8-6-7-6.
         c.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      3.   Documentation And Record Retention For Categorical Industrial User
Monitoring Waivers:
         a.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the pretreatment

   A.   If another municipality, or user located within another municipality,
contributes wastewater to the POTW service area, the village shall enter into
an intergovernmental agreement with the contributing municipality.
   B.   An intergovernmental agreement, as required by subsection A., above,
shall contain the following conditions:
      1.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt the village
sewer use and pretreatment ordinance (SUPO), including local limits and
amendments as required by USEPA. This agreement shall authorize the village to
enforce the village's sewer use and pretreatment ordinance against users in its
service area. The village shall have the power and authority to do within the
service area whatever the village is empowered to do within the village limits
pursuant to sewer use and pretreatment ordinance and enforcement response plan
(ERP).
      2.   The requirement shall specify that such ordinance and local limits
must be revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the village's sewer use
and pretreatment ordinance or local limits. After review and approval by USEPA,
followed by public notice as required, the village shall adopt such revisions
or additions as needed to the sewer use and pretreatment ordinance. Said local
limits will be applied to industrial users located in the village and in its
service area. Whenever the village revises its sewer use and pretreatment
ordinance, it will forward a copy of the revisions to the affected municipality
through the director of public works.
   C.   The intergovernmental agreement shall identify that the Village of
Bensenville shall perform technical and administrative duties necessary to
implement and enforce its sewer use and pretreatment ordinance consistent with
its program and enforcement response plan approved by USEPA within the village
limits and its service area and shall share any information or records
concerning industrial users outside the village limits with the appropriate
municipality when requested. At minimum, the village shall:
      1.   Annually update the industrial waste survey;
      2.   Require submittal of information and reports,
      3.   Review and sign-off on any IEPA permit completed by industrial users
in the service area;
      4.   Issue or deny, discharge or zero discharge permits (as appropriate)
to all industrial users required to obtain a permit;
      5.   Conduct inspections, sampling, and analysis;
      6.   Take all appropriate enforcement actions as outlined in its EPA
approved enforcement response plan; and
      7.    Perform any other technical or administrative duties as required by
its wastewater and bio-solids permits.
   D.   In addition, the intergovernmental agreement will provide that the
Village of Bensenville may take emergency action to stop or prevent any
discharge within the village and its service area and shall share any
industrial user information or records in the service area with the appropriate
municipality when requested, which presents or may present an imminent danger
to the health or welfare of humans, which reasonably appears to threaten the
environment, or which threatens to cause interference, pass-through, potential
problems or bio-solids contamination.
   E.   The intergovernmental agreement will require that any municipality in
the service area shall provide water use records to the village on an agreed
frequency. If said municipality inspects or otherwise enforces pretreatment
regulations against any industrial user in the village service area, it shall
convey such information and reports to the village. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
Each user of the POTW and facilities of the village shall provide reports as
necessary to comply with this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit.
Reporting requirements may apply to users that are not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-1: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USERS:
Should the village find that a non-residential user does not meet pretreatment
standards and requirements applicable to its discharge, causes or contributes
to potential problems at the POTW, or when analysis of waste or observation of
the effect of such wastes on the POTW indicate that said wastes cannot be
treated satisfactorily at such works, or that said wastes are injurious to the
POTW, or to the treatment processes, or pollute the natural waters within the
village, its service areas or the waters of the State of Illinois additional
pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required by the village
to meet pretreatment standards and requirements. Such facilities as the village
may deem necessary for pretreatment of the wastes shall be furnished by and at
the expense of the user as a condition of the discharge of said wastes into the
POTW or to any natural water within the village service area.
   A.   Pretreatment Review: The pretreatment coordinator will require the user
to initiate a pretreatment review through a telephone call, letter or certified
letter to the authorized representative of the user.
   B.   Pretreatment Initiation Meeting: A pretreatment initiation meeting will
be held between the pretreatment coordinator and the user to discuss the
problem and the solution to said problem. If it determined that changes in
operation and maintenance, plant modifications, and/or the installation of
pretreatment equipment shall occur to resolve noncompliance, a schedule shall
be established with events and completion deadlines agreeable to both parties
to resolve the noncompliance. If appropriate, a compliance agreement defining
the agreed upon schedule will be sent from the village to the user shortly
after the meeting. If a schedule for compliance acceptable to the pretreatment
coordinator cannot be established, the matter will be referred for further
enforcement action consistent with the provisions of Section
8-6-13 of this chapter as appropriate.
   C.   Progress Reports: Progress reports will be filed by the user on a
schedule agreed to by the pretreatment coordinator and the user concerning the
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an
engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation); the user shall identify whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.
   D.   Final Report: A final report will be filed with the pretreatment
coordinator by the user normally required within ninety (90) calendar days from
the end of the schedule deadline to verify the success or failure or the
schedule objective chosen by the user. The final report will if appropriate
identify the steps being taken by the user to resolve noncompliance. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-2: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL USERS:
In the event that either the village, EPA or a user determines that the user is
regulated as a categorical industrial user by standards and requirements
promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with Section 307 (b) and (c) of the Act,
the following reports are required to be filed by the user with both the
village and USEPA.
   A.   Baseline Monitoring Reports: Within either one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard,
or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR
403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users
currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to
the pretreatment coordinator a report which contains the information listed
below. At least ninety (90) calendar days prior to commencement of their
discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall
submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report which contains the information
listed below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends
to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give
estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
      1.   Identifying Information: The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.
      2.   Environmental Permits: A list of any environmental control permits
held by or for the facility.
      3.   Description Of Operations: A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production, (including each product produced by type, amount,
processes, and rate of production), and standard industrial classifications of
the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a
schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from
the regulated processes.
      4.   Flow Measurement: Information showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).

applicable to each regulated process and any new categorically regulated
processes for existing sources;
         b.   The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the
standard or by the pretreatment coordinator, of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-
term average concentration, (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the standard
requires a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the
user shall submit documentation as required by the pretreatment coordinator or
the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard;
         c.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. A

oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds;
         d.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow the use of the combined wastestream formula
of 40 CFR Part 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority;
         e.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out
in Section
8-6-5-8 and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in Section
8-6-5-9;
         f.   The pretreatment coordinator may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures; and
         g.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the village.
      6.   Compliance Certification: A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative of the categorical industrial user (as defined in
Section
8-6-1-6), and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required for the categorical industrial user to meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.
      7.   Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or operation and
maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or
operation and maintenance. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in Section
8-6-9-2.B.
      8.   Signature And Report Certification: All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with Section
8-6-7-6.
   B.   Compliance Schedule Progress Reports: The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by Section 8-6-9-2 A.7.:
      1.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      2.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) calendar
months;
      3.   The user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment
coordinator no later than fourteen (14) calendar days following each date in
the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether
or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay,
and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the
established schedule;
      4.   In no event shall more than nine (9) calendar months elapse between
such progress reports to the pretreatment coordinator; and
      5.   All compliance schedule progress reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section
8-6-7-6.
   C.   Reports On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline:
Within ninety (90) calendar days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the pretreatment coordinator a report containing the information described in
Section
8-6-9-2 A. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c) and Section
8-6-5-3, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section
8-6-7-6. All sampling will be done in conformance with Section

issue an attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the
village will perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum.
      4.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must
submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      5.   Where the village itself collects all the information required for
the report, the significant non-categorical industrial user will not be
required to submit the report.
   B.   Categorical Industrial Users:
      1.   All industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
(categorical industrial users) shall, at a frequency determined by the
pretreatment coordinator but in no case less than twice per year on dates
specified by the village (normally in July and January), submit a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the discretion of the village
and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the village may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are to be submitted. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with Section
8-6-7-6.
      2.   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge and comply with the
requirements of Sections
8-6-5-8 and
8-6-5-9.
      3.   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu
of categorical industrial user. In such cases, the village will issue an
attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the village will
perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum.
      4.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the pretreatment
coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in Sections
8-6-5-8 and
8-6-5-9, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
      5.   Where the village has imposed mass limitations on users as provided
for by 40 CFR Part 403.6(d), the report required by subsection B.1. of this
section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the pretreatment
standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
      6.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the village in accordance with the procedures in Section
8-6-5-3.F, the report required by subsection B.1. above shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), the report required by subsection B.1. shall include the user's
actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      7.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      8.   Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for pollutants found to be not
present and revision of the user's permit by the pretreatment coordinator, the
user must certify on each periodic report with the statement in Section
8-6-7-6, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the user with the following statement:
   "Based on my inquiry of the Person or Persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______(specify
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard part(s)), I certify that,
to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level
of the _________(list the categorically regulated pollutant(s)) in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic report."
      9.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of Section
8-6-9-3 B.1. or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
pretreatment coordinator, and notify the pretreatment coordinator.
   C.   Non-Significant Categorical Users (NSCIU):
      1.   Non-significant categorical industrial users as defined in Section
8-6-1-6 shall, at a frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator but no
less frequently than annually (on dates specified by the village) submit a
report which contains the certification statement contained in Section
8-6-9-3 C.2. below.
      2.   Certification Statement:
   "Based on my inquiry of the Person or Persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
___, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the
period from _____________,________ to _____________,________ (months, days,
year):
         a.   The facility described as _________________________________
(facility name) met the definition of a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial
User as described by Section
8-6-1-6;
         b.   The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards
and Requirements during this reporting period; and
         c.   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
   This compliance certification is based on the following information:
__________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________"
   The report is required to be signed by an authorized representative of the
user.
   D.   Other Non-Significant Regulated Users:
      1.   Categorical zero process dischargers, non-categorical zero process
dischargers, batch dischargers, food service establishments and any firms
regulated by individual or general permit requirements including but not
limited to best management practices shall, at a frequency determined by the
pretreatment coordinator, submit a periodic report at a frequency defined in
their wastewater discharge permit.
      2.   The reports may require sampling and analyses or some other measure
to determine compliance with permit pretreatment standards and requirements.
The user must submit documentation necessary to determine the compliance status
of user as defined by the pretreatment coordinator and identified in the
wastewater discharge permit.
      3.   All food service establishments with grease interceptors must
maintain cleaning logs. These logs shall be immediately available at the time
of an inspection and are required to contain the following information:
         a.   Person and company that performed the cleaning;
b.    Measurement of the depth of solids blanket and grease cap prior to
cleaning in each trap or interceptor;
         c.   Volume of material removed from each trap or interceptor; and
         d.   Location where waste will be disposed.
         e.   A copy of the cleaning log may be required to be submitted to the
village by a date specified in a request issued by the pretreatment
coordinator. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-4: REPORTS FROM NON-PERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the pretreatment coordinator as required. These reports
include but are not limited to surveys of business activities, water usage,
wastes discharged, spill and slug loading potential, pretreatment equipment,
waste hauling and facility layout. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-5: AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE CHANGE NOTIFICATION:
Any significant industrial user that changes the authorized representative of
its company as defined in Section
8-6-1-6 shall file a change notice with the village within thirty (30) calendar
days. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-6: REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS:
Each user must notify the pretreatment coordinator of any planned substantial
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) calendar days before
the change that for example results in an increase or addition or planned
shutdown or deletion of products. Immediate shutdowns or deletions of products
are required to be noticed within five (5) working days of determination.
   A.   The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
Section
8-6-7-5.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may issue or modify an existing individual
or general wastewater discharge permit under Sections
8-6-8-2 and
8-6-8-4 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   C.   For purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, the addition
or deletion of a shift, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants
including changes to the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which
the user has submitted initial notification under Section
8-6-9-9, introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring waiver had been
obtained, the addition of a new process regardless of waste discharge or lack
of discharge, shutdown of a process, or addition or deletion of a product.
   D.   Significant industrial users and categorical industrial users are
required to immediately notify the pretreatment coordinator of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-
2020)
8-6-9-7: REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
   A.   Initial Notification: In the case of any discharge, including, but not
limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic
nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, any user shall immediately telephone (within
fifteen (15) minutes), and notify the pretreatment coordinator of the incident.
If this notification cannot be made to the POTW staff during routine business
hours, the user shall notify the village police department. This notification
shall include the name of the caller, location of the discharge, physical state
of discharge, chemical composition, concentration and volume, if known, and
date and time of discharge as well as duration of the discharge, and corrective
actions taken by the user. The notification shall include what federal, state
and local entities have also been notified by the user.
   B.   The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   C.   Written Notification: Within five (5) calendar days following such
discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the pretreatment coordinator,
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and
the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
   D.   Such notifications shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   E.   A notice/sign shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees in English and the language of
common use whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection A.
above. Employers shall ensure through documentation that all employees, who may
cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification
procedure. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-8: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
pretreatment coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within thirty
(30) calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not
required to resample if the pretreatment coordinator monitors at the user's
facility at least once a month, or if the pretreatment coordinator samples
between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of
this sampling. If the village performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of
the user, the village will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it
notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
sampling and analysis. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-9: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Pursuant to 40 CFR 40 3.12 (p) any user who commences the discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the USEPA regional waste management
division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the
user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than
one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must
be submitted under Section
8-6-9-6. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections
8-6-9-2 A.,
8-6-9-2 C., and
8-6-9-3 B.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection A., above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the
user must notify the pretreatment coordinator, the USEPA regional waste
management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of
the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) calendar days of the
effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
   E.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-9-10: REPORT SUBMITTAL DUE DATES:
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.
For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern. In order to meet deadlines, reports may be faxed or emailed on
the due date to the village. The original of the fax or email is required to be
mailed to the village postmarked within one (1) working day of the
transmission. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-10: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
8-6-10-1: RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The pretreatment coordinator and his designee(s), duly authorized agents of the
village, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as above named entities,
shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the
user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual or
general wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the above named entities ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, analyses,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the above named entities will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The village shall have the right to set up on the user's property or
require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated twice yearly (at six (6)-month intervals) to ensure their
accuracy. The user shall submit these calibration reports semi-annually to the
village with the periodic compliance reports required in Section
8-6-9-3.
   D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the pretreatment coordinator and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the pretreatment coordinator and his
designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   F.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist, as per
section
8-6-3-6, the "sampling facility" shall be considered to be either the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected or the point of process wastewater discharge within the building.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-10-2: RECORD KEEPING:
   A.   Users: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities Undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established under
Section
8-6-8-2. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the village, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the pretreatment coordinator.
   B.   Village: The village will maintain documentation of any monitoring
waiver issued per Section
8-6-7-5.D for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the waiver.
The documentation will include the reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver. (Ord. 4-2020,
1-28-2020)
8-6-10-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the pretreatment coordinator has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the pretreatment coordinator may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of DuPage County. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-11: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual or general wastewater discharge
permits, and monitoring programs, and the pretreatment coordinator inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator and village attorney, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-12: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The pretreatment coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous
twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements including instantaneous limits. The
term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant
industrial users and categorical industrial users (or any other user that
violates subsections C., D., or H. of this section) and shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter during a six-(6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits as defined in Section
8-6-5.
   B.   Technical review criteria violations, defined here as those in which
thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six (6)-month period equals or exceeds the product
of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous
limits, as defined by Section
8-6-5 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by Section
8-6-5 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the pretreatment coordinator has determined caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of potw personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the pretreatment
coordinator exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within forty-five (45) calendar days after the due
date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, that the pretreatment coordinator determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-13: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
8-6-13-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
   A.   When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. A notice of violation will be sent to the industry after
all sampling results have been received from the sampling period. For the first
and second violation counts, the notice of violation will be sent within thirty
(30) working days of completion of a sampling cycle data receipt. For the third
and subsequent violations, the notice of violation will be sent once per month
during the village's ticket writing period. Industries will need to provide
within ten (10) working days of the receipt of this notice or by the deadline
defined (usually within twenty (20) village business days of issuance excluding
holidays), an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the pretreatment coordinator. Submission of this
plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may initiate a pretreatment review meeting
for any violation issued under Section
8-6-13-1 A. but most likely for the first violation of any parameter. The
village shall schedule a pretreatment review meeting, normally within thirty
(30) calendar days of the determination that a meeting is required.
As a result of a pretreatment review meeting, the village may issue a
compliance directive stating that the user is in a "corrective action" status.
A plan for correction and compliance schedule illustrating milestones may be
issued by the village to the user. This plan for correction and compliance
schedule may become part of the user's permit. The user is responsible for
meeting the permit limits at all times. The plan for correction, compliance
schedule and revised permit does not relieve the user of meeting the permit
limits and/or ordinance requirements. The user shall take whatever actions are
necessary to meet the permit limits and permit conditions.
   C.   As a result of a violation, the village may continue to sample the user
and inspect the user's progress towards meeting milestones as needed to
determine if the user is complying with the conditions of the plan of action,
compliance schedule and/or permit. In the event the village detects and
documents any violation; a notice of violation will be issued to the user.
   D.   Each detected violation of the plan of action, compliance schedule, and
permit, will result in a notice of violation being issued to the user. When
notice of violation #3 (total of three notices of violation) is issued, a
"ticket" shall be issued to the user, authorized representative per Title 13,
Chapter 1 of the Bensenville Administrative Code. The ticket is a legal notice
requiring the user to appear in court, either DuPage Circuit Court or the
village adjudication court per Section
8-6-14-2. The village may charge assessments to the user as provided for in the
code.
   E.   When the user has met the conditions of the plan of action, compliance
schedule, and permit, the village will notify the user in writing that the
conditions have been satisfied and they are no longer under a "corrective
action" status if such a status was formally issued.
   F.   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the pretreatment
coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 4-2020,
1-28-2020)
8-6-13-2: COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS:
The pretreatment coordinator may enter into compliance agreements, i.e. consent
orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
8-6-13-4 and
8-6-13-5 and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-13-3: SHOW CAUSE ORDER:
The pretreatment coordinator may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear at a specified date and time to show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten (10) working days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-13-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
pretreatment coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-13-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the pretreatment
coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-
2020)
8-6-13-6: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The pretreatment coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
pretreatment coordinator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment
coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The pretreatment
coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Section
8-6-13-7 are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment coordinator prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections
8-6-13-3 or
8-6-13-7.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-13-7: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in Section
8-6-8-6, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
   A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
8-6-5 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
8-6-13-3 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the pretreatment coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-14: PENALTIES AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
8-6-14-1: RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED:
   Any entity or user violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or who
causes damage to or impairs the village's POTW shall be liable to the village
for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The
village may invoice the costs, including but not limited to, sampling and
analyses associated with the investigation, costs of mitigating impact to the
POTW, costs of preparing the administrative enforcement actions such as notices
and orders; investigative and/or correction actions, and review of response(s)
from the user. In the event of damage, losses or impairments, the village shall
bill the user for the costs incurred by the village for any cleaning, repair,
replacement or other investigative and/or corrective action(s) as a response to
the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute
a violation of this chapter enforceable under the provisions of 8-6-13 of this
chapter.
   Recovery of costs incurred also includes but is not limited to the following
provisions specific to food service establishments:
   A.   Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee: Food service establishments that
operate without a grease interceptor may be required to pay an annual grease
disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of increase maintenance of
the sewer system as a result of the food service establishment's inability to
adequately remove fats, oils and grease from its wastewater discharge. This
section shall not be interpreted to allow the new construction of, or existing
food service establishment undergoing remodeling to operate without an approved
grease interceptor.
      1.   The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be established in Section
8-6-17 of this chapter and shall be based on the estimated annual increased
cost of maintaining the sewer system for inspection and removal of fats, oils
and grease and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the food
service establishment resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor or grease
control device.
      2.   Sewer System Overflows, Public Nuisance, Abatement And Cleanup
Costs: Notwithstanding the waiver of grease interceptor installation for
existing food service establishment established in Section
8-6-3-8, food service establishments found to have contributed to a sewer
blockage, sewer system overflows or any sewer system interferences resulting
from the discharge of wastewater or waste containing fats, oils or grease may
be subject to costs incurred by the village established in Section
8-6-17 of this chapter. Sewer system overflows may cause threat and injury to
public health, safety, and welfare of life and property and are hereby declared
public nuisances. Furthermore, sewer lateral failures and sewer system
overflows caused by food service establishment alone or collectively, are the
responsibility of the private property owner or food service establishment, and
individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the food service
establishment. If the village must act immediately to contain and clean up a
sewer system overflow caused by blockage of a private or public sewer lateral
or system serving a food service establishment, or at the request of the
property owner or operator of the food service establishment, or because of the
failure of the property owner or food service establishment to abate the
condition causing immediate threat of injury to the health, safety, welfare, or
property of the public, the village's costs for such abatement may be entirely
borne by the property owner or operator of the food service establishment, and
the individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the food service
establishment(s) and may constitute a debt to the village and become due and
payable upon the village's request for reimbursement of such costs. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-14-2: ALTERNATIVE ADJUDICATION HEARING PROCESS:
The pretreatment coordinator in conjunction with the village attorney as
defined by Title 13, Chapter 1 of the Bensenville Municipal Code shall have the
discretion to direct any process involving civil fines and penalties set forth
in this subchapter to the administrative adjudication hearing process described
in Title 13 Chapter 1 of the Bensenville Municipal Code. Upon filing of any
action before the administrative adjudication hearing officer, he or she shall
have plenary powers to levy all civil fines and penalties, to decide and
continue cases and to take all other quasi-judicial steps which are consistent
with the grant of powers given in said Title 13, Chapter 1. However, consistent
with the limitations on the grants of powers that can be devolved onto such
hearing officers, the administrative adjudication hearing officer shall have no
jurisdiction to levy any criminal fine or to issue any form of injunction,
restraining order or other extraordinary remedy. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-14-3: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition the Circuit Court of
DuPage County through the village attorney for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual or general wastewater discharge permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The
pretreatment coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord.
4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-14-4: CIVIL PENALTIES:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition
the Circuit Court of DuPage County through the village attorney for civil
penalties as follows:
   A.   Any user shall be subject to the imposition of a civil penalty in at
least the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) a day for each violation.
In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may recover costs, including but not
limited to, filing fees, witness fees, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
village.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by
the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-
2020)
8-6-14-5: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The pretreatment
coordinator may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the village's enforcement response plan. However, the
pretreatment coordinator may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the pretreatment coordinator is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 4-
2020, 1-28-2020)

(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-15-2: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The pretreatment coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, a previous individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to
the village, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the pretreatment
coordinator to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-
28-2020)
8-6-15-3: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The pretreatment coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, a previous individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused
by its discharge. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-15-4: PAYMENT FOR OUTSTANDING FEES AND PENALTIES:
The pretreatment coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any
outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of
this chapter, a previous individual or general wastewater discharge permit or

including reimbursing the village for any costs incurred in removing, abating,
or remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-15-7: CONTRACTOR LISTING:
Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements are hereby declared to be non-responsible users and therefore
are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or
services to the village. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services
to the village held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of
the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-16: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS;
8-6-16-1: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "Upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection C., below, are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment
coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written report must be provided within
five (5) working days):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-16-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Sections
8-6-5-2 A. and B. or the specific prohibitions in Sections
8-6-5-2 C.1. through C.26. (excluding subsections C.2., C.10. and C.17.) if it
can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference or that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the village was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable bio-solids use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-16-3: BYPASS :
   A.   For the purposes of this section,
      1.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user's treatment or pretreatment facility.
      2.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections C. and D. of this section.
   C.   Bypass Notifications:
      1.   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten (10)
working days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      2.   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment
coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) working
days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
   D.   POTW Actions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C. of
this section.
      2.   The pretreatment coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the pretreatment coordinator
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection D.1. of
this section. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-17: MISCELLANEOUS FEES:
8-6-17-1: PRETREATMENT FUNDING, CHARGES AND FEES:
   A.   Pretreatment Program General Funding: It is The intent of the village
to pass all general costs of the pretreatment program to all non residential
users. The pretreatment regulations require ordinance compliance evaluations
for all non residential users and the fees are based on water usage per billing
period combined with water line size. The general industrial pretreatment
charges shall apply to non-residential users and may be found in Title 8,
Section 7-7 of the village code.
   B.   The village may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the village's pretreatment program unique to a
specific user. These fees will be invoiced quarterly along with surcharge fees
and may include:
      1.   Categorical pretreatment standard determination, establishment and
documentation for wastewater discharge permit;
      2.   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
      3.   Fees for establishing and reviewing best management practices plans
and requirements;
      4.   Fees for Reviewing plans or construction relating to spill
prevention containment and countermeasures / slug load plans as defined in
Section
8-6-6-5;

coordinator to address user noncompliance;
      9.   Fees to install a sewer plug; and
      10.   Other fees as the village may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties
chargeable by the village.
(Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-17-2: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
   A.   In addition to remedies available to the village set forth elsewhere in
this chapter, if the POTW is fined by the state or USEPA for violation of the
POTW NPDES permit or violation of water quality standards as the result of
discharge of pollutants by a user or group of users, then the fine, including
all legal, sampling, analytical testing costs and any other related costs
incurred by the village shall be charged to the responsible user or group of
users. Such charges shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies the village may have under this chapter, statutes, regulations, at law
or in equity.
   B.   If the discharge from any non-residential user causes a deposit,
obstruction or damage to any portion of the POTW, the POTW shall cause the
deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to be
promptly repaired. The cost for such work, including materials, labor and
supervision, shall be borne by the person or non-residential user causing such
deposit, obstruction, or damage. (Ord. 4-2020, 1-28-2020)
8-6-18: USER CHARGE AND SURCHARGE INDUSTRIAL WASTE COST RECOVERY:
8-6-18-1: USER AND SURCHARGE RATES:
   A.   The wastewater service charges for the use of and for the service
supplied by the POTW of the village shall consist of a fixed user charge to pay
fixed expenses of the cost of operation, maintenance and replacement of the
system; a basic user rate to pay variable expenses of said operation and
maintenance expense and debt service charge to pay principal and interest of
outstanding revenue bonds issued for sewer construction purposes. There shall
be and there is hereby established a fixed user charge to each unit served
(single user or multiple user) of the POTW of the village. Actual rates are
included in Title 8-7 of the village code.
      1.   The fixed user charge shall be computed by allocating administrative
expenses (administrative salaries and employee insurance) and the infiltration-
inflow volume equally among all users. This allocation shall be made by
dividing the total annual amount of such administrative costs and the cost of
treating infiltration-inflow by the number of connections or units served by
the system and thereafter dividing such annual user charge by twelve (12) to
define the monthly rate based on water line size.
      2.   The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual
cost of debt service of revenue bonds outstanding applicable to the
construction of sewerage system improvements by the number of connections or
units served by the system and dividing the annual rate by twelve (12) to
determine the monthly rate based on water line size. The adequacy of the
wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public
accountants to the village in their annual audit report. The wastewater service
charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a
change in the number of users and in operation and maintenance costs including
equipment replacement costs. The purpose of annual review is to assure that
each user through the wastewater service charge pays a proportionate share of
the cost of operation and maintenance, including debt service, and to maintain
proportionality of the user charge system. Currently the debt service charge is
contained in the fixed rate.
   B.   The basic user rate shall be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters for the purpose of paying the remaining or variable cost associated with
operation, maintenance and replacement and capital of the system. The
wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period shall be multiplied by
the rates. Actual rates are included in Title 8-7 of the village Code.
      1.   The basic user rate will be applicable for wastes having the
following average strength waste characteristics:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree (20°) C. biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
         b.   A total suspended solids (TSS) content of two hundred twenty
milligrams per liter (220 mg/l).
         c.   An ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) content of fifteen milligrams per
Liter (15 mg/l).
      2.   The basic user rate shall consist of operation and maintenance costs
plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:
         a.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the POTW including an equipment replacement fund for the year, for all
works categories.
         b.   Proportion the estimated costs to POTW categories by volume, SS,
BOD and ammonia-nitrogen.
         c.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD and
pounds of ammonia-nitrogen to be treated
         d.   Compute costs per thousand gallons for average strength waste.
         e.   Compute the unit costs per thousand gallons and per pound of BOD,
SS and NH3-N based on average strength waste.
   C.      A surcharge in addition to the basic User charge will be levied to
all non-residential users quarterly where those discharges exceed the domestic
BOD, SS and NH3-N concentrations outlined above in Section
8-6-18-1.B.1. The surcharge will be based on metered sewage flow for all wastes
which exceed these concentrations. Following are the specifics for the
procedure to compute a surcharge rate:

8-7-2: CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL:
   A.   State And Local Standards: All plumbing installed within the village
shall be installed in accordance with the Illinois plumbing code, 77 Illinois
administrative code 890. If in accordance with the Illinois plumbing code or in
the judgment of the water division supervisor, an approved backflow prevention
device is necessary for the safety of the public water supply system, the water
division supervisor will give notice to the water customer to install such an
approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner in accordance
with the Illinois plumbing code, Illinois environmental protection agency and
all applicable local regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made of
such approved devices upon installation and annually thereafter, at a minimum.
The owner of the premises shall maintain records to document that testing,
servicing and repairs are conducted as required.

permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection
whereby a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular
public water supply of the village enter the supply or distribution system of
said municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and
the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
water division supervisor and the Illinois environmental protection agency.
   C.   Surveys And Investigations: It shall be the duty of the water division
supervisor to cause surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and
other properties served by the public water supply to determine whether actual
or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and
investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated at
least every two (2) years, or as often as the water division supervisor shall
deem necessary. Records of such surveys shall be maintained and available for
review for a period of at least five (5) years.
   D.   Cross Connection Control Device Inspections: The approved cross
connection control device inspector shall have the right to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the village for the purpose of verifying the presence
or absence of cross connections, and that the water division supervisor or his
authorized agent shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system of the village for the purpose of verifying information submitted by the
customer regarding the required cross connection control inspection. On demand,
the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
water division supervisor any information which he may request regarding the
piping system or systems or water use on such property. The refusal of such
information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the water division
supervisor, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper connections as
provided in this section.

necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply
distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored until
such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the
provisions of this section, and until a reconnection fee of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) is paid to the village. Immediate disconnection with verbal
notice can be effected when the water division supervisor is assured that
imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system
exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of the cause of
disconnection. Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be
effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the water
division supervisor or the Illinois environmental protection agency, such
action is required to prevent actual or potential contamination or pollution of
the public water supply. Neither the public water supply, the water division
supervisor, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to any customer for any
injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from termination of said
customer's water supply in accordance with the terms of this section, whether
or not said termination was with or without notice.

8-7-8: BILLING PROCEDURE, NONPAYMENT OF BILLS, WATER SHUTOFF:
The rates or charges for water and sewer services shall be due and payable as
indicated on the bill for services. The owner of the premises, the occupant
thereof, the user of the water and/or sewer service, and the person or other
entity in possession of the water meter installed on the premises shall be
jointly and severally liable to pay for the service on such premises, and
service is furnished to the premises by the Village only upon the condition
that the owner of the premises, the occupant thereof, the user of the service,
and the person or other entity in possession of the water meter installed on
the premises are jointly and severally liable therefor to the Village. The
owner of any premises to which water and/or sewer service is furnished is
liable to pay for such service and such service is to be furnished by the
Village, regardless of any separate private agreements that the owner may
maintain with a third-party for liability. The owner of the premises is at all
times required to notify the Village of the billing address and such other
information required by the Village regardless of any sale or transfer of the
premises, or change in occupancy or user of water and/or sewer service at the
premises. (Ord. 1-93, 1-5-1993; amd. Ord. 9-2008, 2-19-2008)
All bills for services shall be payable by the close of business on the
twentieth day after the rendition of the bill or by the due date as provided in
the bill, whichever occurs last. If payment of the full amount of the bill is
not made within such period, then a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
outstanding amount of the bill shall be added thereto. In the event the charge
for service is not paid within forty five (45) days after the rendition of the
bill, such charge shall be deemed and is hereby declared delinquent, and
thereafter such delinquency shall constitute a lien upon the real estate for
which such service is supplied, and the Village Clerk is hereby authorized and
directed to file sworn statements showing such delinquency in the Office of the
Recorder of Deeds of DuPage or Cook Counties, Illinois in accordance with 65
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-139-8, and the filing of such statements in
such offices shall be deemed notice of the lien for the payment of such charges
for such services. The Village Attorney is authorized to institute foreclosure
proceedings in the name of the Village against any property against which a
lien has been recorded in a like manner and with like effect as set forth under
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-139-8.
If the charge for such service is not paid within forty five (45) days after
rendition of the bill, such service may be terminated, and shall not be
reinstated until all past due bills, including the penalties thereon, are paid
in full together with the payment of fifty dollars ($50.00) if water service is
turned on from seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to three o'clock (3:00) P.M. Monday
through Friday and seventy five dollars ($75.00) if turned on during all other
hours including holidays, either in U.S. currency or by a certified negotiable
instrument. The Village shall give the owner of the premises, the occupant
thereof and the account holder at least ten (10) days' notice of intent to shut
off such service, the reason for the shutoff, the past due amount, and an
opportunity to request and obtain a hearing with respect to such unpaid charges
before the Finance Director, or such designee. The Village shall notify the
owner of the premises and the account holder of the past due billing by mailing
a written notice of termination to the billing address and to the owner of
record, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number. For all
buildings other than buildings with three (3) or more residential apartments,
the Village shall notify the occupant of the premises by either mailing a
written notice of termination to the premises or by posting a notice at the
premises warning that the service will be shut off. For buildings with three
(3) or more residential apartments, the Village shall notify each tenant of the
premises by either mailing a written notice of termination to the premises or
by posting a notice at the premises warning that the service will be shut off.
If the Finance Director, or such designee, confirms the shutoff after a
hearing, if requested, the owner, occupant and account holder shall be allowed
a reasonable period of time, not less than five (5) days, to pay the delinquent
charges prior to the shutoff of services. (Ord. 1-93, 1-5-1993)
It shall be the duty of the Finance Director to enforce the provisions of this
section whenever delinquency shall occur. Therefore, ten (10) days after such
notice of termination is effectuated or five (5) days after the hearing with
the Finance Director, or such designee, wherein service shutoff was confirmed,
service shall be terminated.
The Village may also enforce collection of delinquent water and sewer bills by
filing civil proceedings in the Circuit Court. Such proceeding may be against
the owner of the premises for which the water and/or sewer service was supplied
or any tenant, lessee, occupant or user who contracted for such water and/or
sewer service or against both of them. The defendant(s) in such proceeding
shall be liable for the amount of the delinquent bill, together with all
penalties provided in this chapter, reasonable attorney fees and costs.
Any change of ownership or occupancy shall not affect the application of this
section. At no time shall the nonreceipt of a bill exempt the owner of the
premises, the occupant thereof, the user of the water and/or sewer service to
such premises and the person or other entity in possession of the water meter
installed on the premises from any responsibility or liability imposed in this
chapter.
Whenever the Village Manager or Finance Director determines that a given
party's water or sewer account is in arrears, the Village Manager or Finance
Director is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with such party to
avoid termination of service.
   A.   Such agreement may create payment plans designed to allow such party to
pay over time past due amounts for service received. The Village Manager and
Finance Director shall be authorized to establish rules, regulations and terms
for such agreement and payment plans. The Village Manager or Finance Director
is authorized to waive outstanding penalties accrued on such party's account
for those parties who enter into an agreement. At a minimum, such agreement
must provide that all bills for future service will be paid in full on time and
that the agreed amount will be paid in full. Such agreement shall provide terms
for the repayment of the agreed amount in installments for a specified period,
require a minimum good faith down payment of the outstanding balance and
provide for a mechanism to enforce the collection of unpaid balances, including
the recording of a lien on the real estate in question.
   B.   In the event a party fails to abide by the terms of such agreement, the
outstanding balance and all penalties shall become due and the Village Manager
or Finance Director shall terminate service ten (10) days after notice of
termination is effectuated.
Notwithstanding anything in this Code to the contrary, no building permits,
occupancy permits, zoning certificates, business licenses, or any other village
issued permit or license of any kind or type shall be issued to any applicant
therefor if such applicant is indebted to the village for any overdue bill or
fee, including, but not limited to, any overdue bill for water and sewer
services. (Ord. 65-2008, 8-18-2008; amd. Ord. 41-2020, 8-25-2020)
8-7-9: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT APPROVAL:
In order to effectuate a change in water and sewer service upon the transfer of
a one-family dwelling, a one-family dwelling attached, a condominium dwelling
or a structure used as a one- family dwelling or a two-family dwelling, the
community development department must grant its approval in writing. If the
community development department has not previously granted their approval, the
department of management services shall terminate service to the premises until
the community development department has granted its approval. (Ord. 35-93, 12-
7-1993; amd. Ord. 21-94, 5-3-1994)
8-7-10: DEPOSIT OF FUNDS:
The village treasurer shall receive all such revenue from the combined
waterworks and sewerage system and all other funds and monies incident to the
operation of such system as the same may be delivered to him, and deposit the
same in a separate fund designated as the village of Bensenville waterworks and
sewerage fund. Said treasurer shall administer such fund in every respect and
in the manner provided by the statutes of the state 1 . (Ord. 1-93, 1-5-1993)
Said treasurer shall receive all unincorporated system connection fees paid
pursuant to the provisions of subsection

same in the said separate fund designated hereunder as the village of
Bensenville waterworks and sewerage fund.
Said treasurer shall receive all unincorporated connection surcharges paid
pursuant to the provisions of subsection

8-7-12: WATER METERS:
   A.   Meters Required: All water consumers supplied by the village shall be
supplied through meters only, and shall pay for the water at the rates and in
the manner specified in this chapter.
   B.   Placement, Care Of Meters And Meter Interface Units (MIU): A meter and
MIU shall be placed in the building under the direction and supervision of the
water supervisor, and shall be located as near as possible to where the service
pipe enters the building or structure, and so as to afford easy access for
examining and reading. A quick connect, surface mount jack assembly (4-wire)
shall be installed within five feet (5') of the meter and MIU. The jack
assembly shall be wired into the building's telephone service wiring to
facilitate remote meter reading. An active phone line shall be in place and the
number on file with the village before the supply of water will be provided.
After the meter and MIU are placed, only members or employees of the water
division shall be allowed to repair, remove or in any manner interfere with the
same. A stopcock or valve shall be placed on each side of the meter. At the
time a permit is issued to connect to the water main or when water service is
altered so as to require a new meter and MIU, said new meter and MIU
customarily used by the village must be purchased from the village. An
additional charge of twenty five percent (25%) of the cost of the meter and MIU
will be charged for installing same. The owner or user of said meter and MIU
shall at all times be responsible for any damage done to the meter and MIU,
including damage done by freezing, hot water or breakage, and also for the
theft thereof. It shall be unlawful for any person to injure, deface, mar,
destroy or in any manner interfere with any such meter and MIU. It shall be the
duty of such owner of or user of said meter and MIU to promptly notify the
division of all defects in any meter and MIU or of its failure to properly
register the quantity of water.
   C.   Fire Protection Service Line: In addition to the requirements above,
any commercial or industrial building having a water, fire protection service
line, shall have said line equipped and maintained with a detector meter and
MIU, the cost and maintenance of the same to be the responsibility of the owner
of the premises or the user of the water service.
   D.   Meter Failing To Operate: Whenever any meter or MIU, by reason of its
being out of repair or for any cause, fails to promptly register the water
passing through the same, the consumer shall be charged at the rate shown for
the corresponding time of the previous year under like conditions. If no record
of the previous year exists, then it shall be the duty of the supervisor to
estimate or determine so far as he can, the amount of water consumed during the
time such meter or MIU fails to operate, and the consumer shall pay the amount
so estimated by said supervisor. (Ord. 1-93, 1-5-1993)
   E.   Village Request For Meter Reading: In the event the village is unable
to read a water meter by telephone, in a given month, the village will estimate
the amount of water consumed and will submit the bill to the user accordingly.
After two (2) consecutive calendar months of estimated billing, a manual
reading by water division staff will be performed and a seventy five dollar
($75.00) fee will be added to the water billing for the third consecutive
month. Manual readings will be taken for the fourth and fifth consecutive
months if the meter still cannot be read by telephone for any reason, including
lack of telephone service, and the seventy five dollar ($75.00) fees added to
the respective monthly billings. If after six (6) consecutive months the meter
cannot be read by telephone for whatever reason, the village shall have the
right to discontinue water service to the premises until the ability to read
the meters automatically is established. If the installation of an outside
meter reading device is required, a onetime fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00)
shall be charged. The village may waive the automatic metering requirement if
prior arrangements are made which are acceptable to the village. (Ord. 21-97,

8-7-13: VILLAGE LIABILITY:
All connections and water supplied for hereunder and all the water used shall
be upon the express condition that the village shall not be liable, nor shall
any claim be made against it for damages or injury caused by reason of the
breaking of any main, branches, service pipes, apparatus or appurtenances
connected with said system or plant, or any part or portion of said plant, or
for any interruption of the supply by reason of the breakage of machinery or by
reason of stoppage, alterations, extensions or renewals. (Ord. 1-93, 1-5-1993)
8-7-14: ACCESS TO PREMISES:
The water supervisor and every person authorized by him or the division, and
all meter and MIU inspectors, shall have ready access to the premises, places

planting, pruning, removal, construction, accidents/vandalism, and natural
disasters. This plan also is to provide for the proper parkway and right-of-way
standards and establishment of new trees, the protection and maintenance of
existing trees and timely removal of hazardous or infectious diseased trees on
both public and private lands. The Village's trees, landscape, and parks are
critical infrastructure to the Village, residents, wildlife, and planet, and
must be protected and cared for responsibly.

through the filtering effect of trees on air pollutants, reduce noise within
the village through the baffle and barrier effect of trees on the spread of
noise, reduce topsoil erosion through the soil retention effect of tree roots,
reduce energy consumption through windbreak and shade effects, provide nesting
areas for birds and other wildlife which in turn assist in the control of
insects, reduce storm-water runoff and the costs associated therewith,
replenish groundwater supplies and protect as well as increase property values.
   C.   The Director of the Public Works Department and/or their designee,
hereinafter referred to as the "Director", shall have full authority and
responsibility to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees and woody plants
growing in or upon all municipal streets, rights-of ways, city parks, and other
public property. This shall include the removal of trees that may threaten
electrical, telephone, gas, or any municipal water or sewer line, or any tree
that is affected by fungus, insect, or other pest disease. All city departments
will coordinate as necessary with the Director and will provide services as
required to ensure compliance with this chapter as it relates to streets,
alleys, rights-of-way, drainage, easements, and other public properties not
under direct jurisdiction of the Director. No person shall hinder, prevent,
delay, or interfere with the Director or his agents while engaged in carrying
out the execution or enforcement.

   A.   Tree Pruning Program: The Board of Trustees hereby creates and sets up
an annual tree pruning program for the maintenance and care of all public
trees. The Village has been divided into six (6) pruning zones; each zone shall
be trimmed once every four (4) years. (See Pruning Zones Map in section
8-10-12 of this chapter.)
   B.   Standards: All Village-owned trees shall be pruned in accordance with
the most current edition of the "American National Standard for Tree Care
Operations" ANSI A300 Pruning (part 1). This work will be accomplished within
the following specifications:
      1.   Crown cleaning and thinning.
      2.   Removing under branches to permit clearance of approximately fifteen
feet (15') where practical to allow motor vehicles to pass and approximately
eight feet (8') on the sidewalk side for pedestrian use. Lowest branches shall
not start lower than six feet (6') above ground when practical.
      3.   Remove trunk suckers and water sprouts, especially where they are
present at the base of the trunk.
      4.   Limbs shall be removed which overhang houses with the objective to
raise the trees aesthetically to maintain clearance. Exceptions to this
requirement may be made when the removal of a sound limb will greatly detract
from the overall appearance of the tree. In those cases where determinations
cannot be easily made, the Director of Public Works or their designee (Village
forester, horticulturalist, etc.) shall be consulted.
      5.   Smaller limbs shall be removed within three feet (3') of overhead
utility services from the house to the public utility pole or line or as
necessary for proper clearance.
      6.   Remove all dead, dying, diseased, interfering, objectionable and
weak branches and stubs greater than two inches (2") in diameter from all
trees.
      7.   Remove one of two (2) or more crossed and/or rubbing branches from
the trees where practical.
      8.   All cuts to be made sufficiently close to parent limb, without
cutting into the branch collar or leaving a protruding stub, so that closure
can readily start under normal conditions.
      9.   Rope down all branches where damage could be incurred by the gouging
of a sodded area and/or damage to public walks. Use caution where there is the
possibility of damaging adjacent privately owned shrubs, trees, or flowers.
      10.   Precut all limbs being removed whenever there is a possibility of
stripping the bark.
   C.   Footwear: No person (whether Village employee or contractor) working in
trees shall use shoes with spikes or any other footwear, which will, in the
Village's opinion, injure the trees while work is being performed. At no time
shall any person working in trees for pruning purposes wear spurs or climbing
irons.
   D.   Streetlights And Traffic Control Devices: Clear all streetlight and
traffic control devices including non-illuminated signage to allow adequate
lighting and sign visibility for the length of the trim cycle.
   E.   Safety: The Village requires the use of all safety devices and
procedures which will conform to the most current editions of American National
Standards Institute, ANSI standard Z133.1 (for pruning, repairing, maintaining
and removing trees and cutting brush and for arboricultural operations - safety
requirements).
   F.   Pruning, Right-Of-Way Clearance Of Private Trees: Every owner of any
privately owned tree overhanging any street or right-of- way within the Village
shall prune the branches so that such branches shall not obstruct the view of
any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet
(8') above the surface of the sidewalk and fifteen feet (15') above the street.
Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous privately owned trees
or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the
public. The Village, in accordance with the law, shall have the right to prune
any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread
of light along the street from a streetlight or interferes with visibility of
any traffic control device or sign.
   G.   Interference: It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent, delay or
interfere with the Village or any of its agents, while engaging in and about
the planting, cultivating, mulching, pruning, spraying, or removing of any
street trees, park trees, or dead, nuisance, or diseased trees on private
grounds.
   H.   Pruning, Village Owned Trees: No homeowner, contractor or anyone else
besides Village employees or Village contractors shall prune any Village owned
tree, shrub, perennial, etc., without approval from the Director of Public
Works or their designee (Village forester, horticulturalist, etc.).
   I.   Violations Of Pruning Regulations: Whoever violates this section, in
addition to any other fines, or fees, shall be subject to the following
provisions:
      1.   Fines: First offense, five hundred dollars ($500.00); second
offense, one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); third and subsequent offense, two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00).
      2.   Appraised Value: If catastrophic injury is incurred or the
aesthetics of the tree are deemed poor from improper pruning, then the
appraised value fine will be put into effect.
      3.   Lien: If the entity or person cannot pay the fines and fees, a lien
shall be placed against their property. (Ord. 32-2019, 5-28-2019)
8-10-6: REMOVALS:
   A.   Removal: Any Village owned tree, shrub, perennial, turf, etc., deemed
diseased, infected, in general decline, or pose a risk and deemed necessary for
removal by the Director of Public Works or their designee (Village forester,
horticulturalist, etc.) will be done by Village employees or contractors of the
Village only.
   B.   Permit: No person shall remove or cut down any tree, shrub, perennial,
turf, etc., in any parkway, right-of-way or other Village-owned property
without first securing a parkway tree removal permit from the Department of
Public Works. Any permit authorizing removal will be subject to such conditions
as the Director of Public Works or their designee (Village forester,
horticulturalist, etc.) may deem necessary or appropriate to minimize damage to
other trees or vegetation on a site and may include the installation of
protective fencing.
   C.   Healthy Trees: The Village does not remove trees deemed healthy by
qualified Village staff.
   D.   Tree Removal Permit: Steps to obtain a tree removal permit for a deemed
healthy tree, shrub, perennial, turf, etc:
      1.   Call 1-630-350-3435, email or visit the Village of Bensenville
Public Works Department at 717 East Jefferson Street to schedule an inspection
of the site with the Director of Public Works or their designee (Village
forester, horticulturalist, etc.).
      2.   If no alterations can be made after an inspection, a tree appraisal
will be done. Tree appraisals consist of the following: tree size, removal/
clean-up/restoration costs, benefits cost, location rating and condition.
(Example: A 15 inch Norway maple has a removal/clean-up cost of $360.00,
benefits cost of $141.00, locations rating of 69 [rating scale of 50, 57, 63,
69, 75] and condition of 4 [scale of 1 - 4] would have an appraised value of
$16,568.74.)
      3.   If after the tree appraisal is completed and the requesting party
still wants the tree removed, the requesting party must pay the appraised value
of the tree to the Village to be used in the landscape budget for future use.
      4.   Once the transaction is completed, the Director of Public Works or
their designee (Village forester, horticulturalist, etc.) will schedule
removal.
   E.   Violations Of Removal Regulations: Whoever violates this section, in
addition to any other fines, or fees, shall be subject to the following
provisions:
      1.   The responsible party must pay the Village's appraised value of the
removed tree to the Village to be used in the landscape budget for future use.
      2.   If the entity or person cannot pay the fines and fees, a lien shall
be placed against their property. (Ord. 32-2019, 5-28-2019)
8-10-7: NUISANCE TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY:
The Village, in accordance with the law, shall have the right to cause the
removal of any dead or diseased trees, or trees that are deemed a nuisance on
private property within the Village, when such trees constitute a hazard to
life and property or harbor insects or disease which constitutes a potential
threat to other trees within the Village. The Village will notify in writing
the owners of such trees. Removal is the responsibility of said owners and
shall be done by the owners at their own expense within sixty (60) days after
the date of service of notice or such other time as may be agreed upon by the
Village and the property owner. In the event of failure of owners to comply
with such provisions, the Village shall have the authority to remove such trees
and file a lien against the property for the amount of the costs of removal.
   A.   Identified nuisances:
      1.   Dutch Elm Disease (DED):
         a.   Nuisance: Any tree or part thereof, which living or dead,

         d.   Abatement By The Village: In case the owner, occupant or agent of
the parcel of land on which a diseased elm tree is located cannot be found or
if found and notified as aforesaid, neglects or refuses to abate the nuisance,
the Village may abate the same by the removal and destruction of the diseased
elm tree, and the owner, occupant, and agent or any of them, shall be charged
with those expenses which may be incurred by the Village in the removal of the
diseased elm tree, which expense shall be collected by the Village by suit, or
otherwise.
         e.   Lien For Removal Cost: The cost of removal and destruction of a
diseased elm tree is a lien upon the real estate affected, superior to all
other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens; provided; that notice has been
given as hereinafter described; and further provided, that within sixty (60)
days after such cost and expense is incurred, the Village, or person performing
the service by authority of the Village, in his own name, files notice of lien

   D.   Root Zone Protection - Ten Inches Or Less: Trees ten inches (10") or
less in diameter must have root zone protection of a minimum of five feet (5')
from the center of the tree. Establish tree diameter at a point of four and a
half feet (4.5') above ground.
   E.   Root Zone Protection - Eleven Inches To Nineteen Inches: Trees between
eleven inches (11") and nineteen inches (19") in diameter must have root zone
protection of a minimum of ten feet (10') from the center of the tree.
Establish tree diameter at a point of four and a half feet (4.5') above ground.
   F.   Root Zone Protection - Greater Than Twenty Inches: Trees greater than
twenty inches (20") in diameter must have root zone protection of a minimum of
fifteen feet (15') from the center of the tree. Establish tree diameter at a
point of four and a half feet (4.5') above ground.
   G.   Crossing Outside The Root Protection Zone: When construction equipment
is permitted to cross the parkway or right-of-way outside the root protection
zone, including dumpster delivery on private property, the parkway must be
protected with a maintained six inch (6") layer of wood chips or mulch, or one
inch (1") layer of plywood or similar approved material sufficient to protect
the entire parkway where equipment crosses. Before any equipment crosses the
parkway, an inspection of the protective layer will be done by the Director of
Public Works or their designee (Village forester, horticulturalist, etc.).
   H.   Final Inspection: Prior to removal of the root zone protection or prior
to any required parkway landscape restoration, a final inspection of the
parkway is required by the Director of Public Works or their designee (Village
forester, horticulturalist, etc.).
   I.   Proper Root Pruning: If construction activity is to occur within the
root zone of existing parkway or right-of-way trees, root pruning and/or
special care will be required. A certified arborist from the Village must
administer, supervise or sign off on any treatments. All required root pruning
must be completed prior to delivery of any materials or equipment, excavation
or actual work begins.
      1.   An approved root pruning mechanical device that cuts to a minimum
depth of eighteen inches (18") is mandatory for any excavation that occurs in
the parkway or right-of-way within the drip line of a Village-owned tree.
      2.   Root pruning must occur no more than six inches (6") outside the
limits of excavation and be continuous within the drip line of the tree. For
excavations bisecting the parkway or right-of- way such as utility connections,
the root pruning cut also must bisect the parkway corresponding to the length
of the excavation.
      3.   Root pruning must be to the depth of four inches (4") below the
lowest point of excavation up to a maximum depth of twenty four inches (24").
      4.   Once excavation begins, if any roots greater than one inch (1") in
diameter are encountered below twenty four inches (24") depth, the root must be
trimmed flush with a sharp saw to eliminate any ragged edges.
      5.   Root pruning can occur no earlier than one month prior to excavation
beginning.

8-10-10: NATURAL DISASTER:
Natural disasters (micro-bursts, tornados, wind storms, snow storms, etc.)
occur and sometimes without much warning. Clean-up and appropriate disaster
response will follow the Village's Emergency Disaster Plan. (Ord. 32-2019, 5-
28-2019)
8-10-11: TREE APPRAISALS:
   A.   The Village utilizes Purdue University Extension Tree Appraisal Formula
when calculating the appraised value of a tree.
   B.   The formula used in this process is: Value = (Basic Tree Cost) x
(Species Rating %) x (Condition Rating %) x (Location Rating %).
      1.   Basic tree cost is calculated by multiplying the cost per square
inch of replacing a tree and the cross sectional area of the removed tree.
         a.   The cost to replace the tree is the sum of the purchase and
installation costs of a new two inch (2") tree divided by the cross sectional
area of a newly planted two inch (2") tree. At the time of publication of this
chapter, the value is ($230 purchase + $100 installation)/3.1 sq. in. = $105/
sq. in. The Village reserves the right to modify this number based on actual
costs and/or industry standards at the time of determination.
         b.   The cross sectional area of the removed tree shall be measured at
the diameter breast height (dbh) of the removed tree.
      2.   Species rating percent is the factor assigned to a given tree
species, based on the Illinois Arborist Association (www.illinoisarborist.org).
This subjective rating is based on individual qualities and traits, which may
vary geographically within the State because of local climate and environmental
influences.
      3.   Condition rating percent is the rating determined by establishing
the overall health and structural integrity of the tree. An assessment of the
condition includes roots, trunk, and canopy. The Village Arborist shall
determine the condition rating on a scale of 1 to 4. For the purpose of the
appraisal calculation the following shall be used: 1 = poor (use 0.25), 2 =
fair (use 0.50), 3 = good (use 0.75), and 4 = excellent (use 1.0).
      4.   Location rating percent is a value determined by the tree's
placement in the landscape and the overall area in which property is located.
The Village has created a map depicting the different location ratings. Ratings
are established as follows: cul-de- sacs/dead ends (use 0.50), parks (use
0.57), secondary roadways (use 0.63), primary roads (use 0.69), and Village
Center (use 0.75).

purpose of making an inspection to determine whether the dwelling or structure
is in compliance with all of the provisions of this code.
An owner, occupant, or other person in charge of a dwelling or structure
subject to the provisions of this code, who is presented with an administrative
warrant obtained pursuant to this section, shall not refuse, impede, inhibit,

structure or premises where an inspection authorized by the administrative
warrant is sought to be made.
An administrative warrant sought pursuant to this section shall be sought in a
court of competent jurisdiction, which court may consider any of the following
factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as
to whether a warrant shall issue:
   A.   Eyewitness account of violations;

   J.   Documented violations on similar properties in the area;
   K.   Passage of time since last inspection;
   L.   Previous violations on the property.
Cause for issuance of a warrant shall be deemed to exist in light of reasonable
legislative and administrative standards which show that there is a reason to
believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to a particular
property in violation of any provisions of this code. (Ord. 84-2010, 11-9-2010)
9-15-8: INSPECTION POLICY AND RECORDKEEPING:
Where admission to premises to be inspected under the provisions of this
chapter is refused by the occupant or person in charge thereof, the village
shall apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an administrative search
warrant to inspect the premises. The administrative warrant shall be for the
purpose of making an inspection to determine whether the dwelling or structure
is in compliance with all of the provisions of this code.
An owner, occupant, or other person in charge of a dwelling or structure
subject to the provisions of this code, who is presented with an administrative
warrant obtained pursuant to this section, shall not refuse, impede, inhibit,
interfere with, restrict, or obstruct entry and free access to any part of the
structure or premises where an inspection authorized by the administrative
warrant is sought to be made.
An administrative warrant sought pursuant to this section shall be sought in a
court of competent jurisdiction, which court may consider any of the following
factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as

legislative and administrative standards which show that there is a reason to
believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to a particular
property in violation of any provisions of this code. (Ord. 84-2010, 11-9-2010)
9-15-9: CERTIFICATES OF INSPECTION:
   A.   Dwellings subject to this chapter shall not be occupied unless a
certificate of inspection has been issued by the village. The rental

as provided in subsection D of this section. The certificate of inspection
shall be issued within fifteen (15) days after written application therefor if
the dwelling at the date of application is entitled thereto.
   B.   Upon finding that there is no condition that would constitute a hazard
to the health and safety of the occupants, and the premises are otherwise fit
for occupancy, the certificate shall be issued. If the finding is of a
condition that would constitute a hazard to health or safety, no certificate of
inspection shall be issued, and an order to comply with this chapter shall be
issued immediately and served upon the owner. On reinspection and evidence of
compliance, the order shall be rescinded and a certificate of inspection
issued.
   C.   A certificate of inspection shall be issued on condition that the
premises remain in a safe, healthful and fit condition for occupancy. If upon
reinspection the village determines that conditions exist which constitute a
hazard to the health or safety of the occupants, the certificate of inspection
may be immediately suspended and a notice shall be served upon the owner to
correct such violations.
   D.   An owner or owner's authorized agent shall apply for a certificate of
inspection. Inspection and issuance of a certificate of inspection shall be in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter and with procedures
established by the village. The village may authorize the issuance of a
temporary certificate of inspection without inspection for those premises in
which there are no violations of record as of the effective date of this
chapter, and shall issue such temporary certificates of inspection upon
applications in cases where inspections are not made within a reasonable time.
Temporary certificates of inspection may also be issued for premises with
violations of record when the owner can show proof of action taken to correct
such conditions.
   E.   It shall be required, and the responsibility of the owner to maintain
the certificate of inspection, either temporary or permanent, as they are
issued, at the premises for which they are issued. The certificate of
inspection shall be displayed on request of a code enforcement officer. Failure
to have the certificate of inspection, or display the certificate of inspection
on request, shall constitute a separate offense for which the owner and/or
occupant are liable.
   F.   Buildings having more than two (2) dwelling units shall post the
building certificate of inspection which shall list all dwelling units in said
building in addition to their permitted occupancy loads. The building
certificate of inspection shall be visible at all times.
   G.   Dwelling units which are part of a building that contains three (3) or
more dwelling units shall receive a certificate of inspection issued to each
specific unit in addition to the building. The building shall not receive a
certificate of inspection until all dwelling units are in compliance with
village codes. (Ord. 84-2010, 11-9-2010)
9-15-10: VIOLATIONS:
   A.   If, upon inspection, the premises or any part thereof are found to be
in violation of any provision of this code to include, but not be limited to,
regulations set forth in titles 6 through 10 of this code, the violation(s)
shall be recorded by the code enforcement officer and retained in the
applicable owner and premises files.
   B.   The owner and lessor or occupant shall be informed of the existence of
the violation(s). The owner and occupant/tenant are responsible for abatement
of violations. The notice shall state the date, name of the code enforcement
officer, the specific details of the violation and the time within which the
correction shall be completed.
   C.   A violation which is determined to constitute a hazard to the health or
safety of the occupants as defined in this chapter, under circumstances where
the premises cannot be vacated, shall be ordered corrected within the shortest
reasonable time. All other violations shall be corrected within a reasonable
time as determined by the village.
   D.   If a violation of any village ordinance is found to exist on the
premises and the violation(s) is not abated, the village may revoke the
certificate of inspection issued. If a certificate of inspection is revoked, a
certificate of inspection shall not be reinstated or issued until all
violations are abated. (Ord. 84-2010, 11-9-2010)
9-15-11: REVOCATION OF RENTAL REGISTRATION:
   A.   A rental registration may be revoked at any time during the occupancy
of the rental unit for which the certificate of inspection has been issued,
should the code enforcement official determine, following a reasonable
investigation, that the unit no longer complies with the provisions of this
code. Prior to the revocation of a rental registration, the code enforcement
division shall provide the owner, agent or manager and the tenant with a
written report stating the defects noted during the investigation and providing
a reasonable time for the correction of said defects, except when the
conditions of the unit pose an immediate threat to the life and safety of the
occupants, in which case the director of community development shall issue a
notice of revocation to the owner, agent or manager and the tenants immediately
and shall then cause the unit to be vacated without delay.
   B.   If a dwelling unit in a multi-family building is found to be in
violation of an ordinance of the village, the village may revoke or suspend the
building rental registration issued to that building as well as the one issued
to the specific unit. The registrations shall remain revoked or suspended until
said violation is abated. (Ord. 56-2014, 11-18-2014; amd. Ord. 5-2025, 1-28-
2025)

Any person whose application for a certificate of inspection has been denied or
revoked or any person who is unable to comply with the provisions of this
chapter with regard to obtaining a certificate of inspection prior to the
issuance of a certificate of inspection shall be granted an appeal to the
community development commission. Such notice of appeal shall be filed within
ten (10) days from the date of requirement to comply or denial or revocation of
a certificate of inspection. The community development commission may grant a
variance from the requirements of this chapter only when the owner or manager
of a residential rental unit can prove that compliance with the requirements of
this chapter will place an extreme hardship on the owner or manager of a rental
property or where physical conditions make compliance impossible. (Ord. 84-
2010, 11-9-2010)
9-15-13: PENALTY:
Any person violating the terms and conditions of this chapter shall be subject
to a penalty not exceeding seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) with each and

being deemed a complete and separate offense. In addition, the appropriate
authorities of the village may take such other action as they deem proper to
enforce the terms and conditions of this chapter including, without limitation,
an action in equity to compel compliance with its terms. That any person
violating the terms of this chapter shall be subject, in addition to the
foregoing penalties, to the payment of court costs and reasonable attorney
fees. (Ord. 84-2010, 11-9-2010)

for public safety, police, fire, emergency management, and other emergency
related activities. (Ord. 13-2014, 2-25-2014)
9-17-2: DEFINITIONS:
For this section, the following definitions shall apply:
ADEQUATE RADIO COVERAGE: Coverage under which a minimum of ninety percent (90%)
of each floor of a building shall be able to receive a minimum signal strength
of one microvolt when transmitted from village communication networks and which
also is specifically able to accommodate village two-way wireless
communications from such locations within a building to a location outside of
said building. The frequency range must be supportable for village police
department communications and shall be at least from seven hundred sixty four
(764) MHz to eight hundred sixty nine (869) MHz, and one hundred fifty (150)
MHz to one hundred fifty five (155) MHz, or as otherwise required by the chief
of police.
BUILDING: Any multi-family residential or nonresidential structure, or any part
thereof, including underground and attic floors. (Ord. 13-2014, 2-25-2014)
9-17-3: FREQUENCY AND LEVEL SPECIFICATIONS:
Except as otherwise provided, no person shall erect, construct or modify any
building or cause the same to be done which fails to support adequate radio
coverage. (Ord. 13-2014, 2-25-2014)
9-17-4: OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY:
It shall be the responsibility of any building owner who currently holds a
certificate of occupancy or allows the building to be used for any purpose to
be in compliance with this chapter if the building is erected, constructed or
modified after the effective date hereof as provided by law. Compliance shall
not be required while a building is under construction or for a portion of a
building that has been vacated for purposes of remodeling, renovation, or
reconstruction. (Ord. 13-2014, 2-25-2014)
9-17-5: TESTING PROCEDURES:
   A.   Initial Testing And Compliance: If the chief of police or his or her
designee shall have a reasonable belief that a building fails to support
adequate radio coverage, the chief of police or his or her designee shall have
conducted a test of the building to determine whether or not the building
supports adequate radio coverage, as follows:
      1.   Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of
approximately twenty (20) equal grid areas.
      2.   A center spot located approximately in the center of each grid area
will be selected, which, once selected, cannot be changed.
      3.   Portable radios of the type the village police department utilizes
will be "keyed" to verify two-way communications between the center spot of
each grid area and the outside of the building.
      4.   If such communications are verified for a given grid area, that grid
area will be counted toward passing the test, and if not, it will be counted
toward failing the test.
      5.   In the event that three (3) or more grid areas fail, the building
will be considered preliminarily to have failed the test.
      6.   Upon a preliminary test failure, each floor of the building shall be
divided into forty (40) equal grid areas and the test repeated. In the event
that five (5) or more grid areas then fail, the building will have failed the
test.
If the building fails the test, the building owner shall install a radio
amplifier system in the building as described in section
9-17-6 of this chapter and then schedule to have the building retested until it
is shown to support adequate radio coverage. A building with a radio amplifier
system will not be considered in compliance with this chapter unless, in
addition to providing adequate radio coverage, the building also passes the
radio amplifier system test described in subsections
9-17-6A through D of this chapter.
   B.   Five Year Testing: Once a building is shown to support adequate radio
coverage, the building owner shall contact the chief of police or his or her
designee to arrange for a radio coverage test as set forth in subsection A of
this section at least once every five (5) years to ensure that the building
continues to comply with this chapter. However, if the building is modified,
expanded, or otherwise structurally altered, or if the building owner believes
that the building may not be in compliance, the building owner shall contact
the chief of police or his or her designee at that time to arrange for such
test to be conducted. No modification, expansion, or other alteration of a

9-17-6: IN-BUILDING RADIO AMPLIFIER SYSTEM:
If any building fails to support adequate radio coverage, or whenever a
building without an in-building radio amplifier system fails to pass the test
set forth in subsection 9-17-5A of this chapter, then its owner shall, within
ninety (90) days of its failing the test, provide to the chief of police or his
or her designee a plan illustrating how the building will be modified to
support adequate radio coverage by installing or modifying a radio amplifier
system within the building. The plan shall be reviewed and approved by the
chief of police or his or her designee. The building owner shall implement the
plan within one year after its approval, and the building shall be retested
upon completion of such installation.
The radio amplifier system may include any of the following to achieve the
required adequate radio coverage: radiating cable system, internal multiple
antenna system with seven hundred/eight hundred (700/800) MHz and one hundred
fifty (150) MHz amplification system, or any combination thereof. If any part
of the installed system contains an electrically powered component, the system
shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system
for a period of at least two (2) hours without external power input. The
battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of an external power
input.
When a radio amplifier system is installed, the building owner shall cause a
technician in possession of a current FCC license, or a technician certified by
the Associated Public-Safety Communications Officials International (APCO), to
test all active components of the system, including, but not limited to,
amplifiers, power supplies and backup batteries, initially in conjunction with
a test to establish that the building supports adequate radio coverage, and
subsequently at least once every twelve (12) months thereafter, as follows:
   A.   Amplifiers shall be tested and gain levels measured upon initial
installation and acceptance; gain levels shall be measured as part of
subsequent tests to ensure that they remain the same as that found upon initial
installation and acceptance.
   B.   Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a
period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual
power outage. If within the one hour test period, in the opinion of the testing
technician, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be
extended for additional one hour periods until the testing technician confirms
the integrity of the battery.
   C.   All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are
operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the intended purpose.
   D.   The technician who performed the test shall prepare a written report
documenting the test findings and all measurements. The building owner shall
provide to the chief of police or his or her designee a copy of the test
findings within ten (10) days of the completion of testing and shall maintain a
copy on file within the building. Within forty five (45) days of the completion
of the testing, the building owner shall correct all deficiencies of the radio
amplifier system stated in the test findings and shall file a written
certification with chief of police or his or her designee that such
deficiencies have been corrected.
The building owner shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair of any
system installed to comply with this section. Every building owner with a
system installed to comply with this section shall provide to the chief of
police the following contact information: 1) the name, address, and telephone
number of the maintenance contractor who will supply a twenty four (24) hour,
seven (7) day emergency response to the building within two (2) hours after
notification by either the village or the building owner in order to repair the
in-building system; and 2) the name, address, and telephone number of the
primary contact personnel for the building owner. (Ord. 13-2014, 2-25-2014)
9-17-7: ROUTINE INSPECTION UPON NOTICE:
Police department personnel or their agent, at any time after providing
reasonable notice to the building owner or his representative, shall have the
right to enter onto the property and into the building to conduct a radio
coverage test to confirm compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 13-2014, 2-25-

Residential Zoning Districts. Refer to figures 10-6-9-1, "Single-Unit Dwelling
And Two-Unit Dwelling Design Requirements", and 10-6-9-2, "Multiple-Unit
Dwelling And Townhouse Dwelling Unit Design Requirements", of this section.
   B.   Design Requirements For Single-Unit Dwellings And Two-Unit Dwellings:
      1.   Facade Articulation: To avoid the appearance of blank walls on
single-unit and two-unit dwellings, facades facing the front yard and corner
side yard must include articulation of the facade, such as entrances, bay
windows, porches, or other architectural features.
      2.   Facade Transparency: Windows are required on facades facing the
front yard, corner side yard, and interior side yard. Minimum transparency of
fifteen percent (15%) is required on facades facing the front yard and corner
side yard. Minimum transparency of ten percent (10%) is required on facades
facing the interior side yard. Security shutters, gates, grills, or other
similar security features, as deemed applicable by the Zoning Administrator,
shall not be fully opaque and shall not be affixed to the exterior of any
building façade.
      3.   Building Orientation For Corner Lots And Reverse Corner Lots:
Single-unit and two-unit dwellings located on corner lots and reverse corner
lots shall have a relationship with the primary and secondary street to
maintain the existing street wall to the greatest extent possible.
      4.   Additions: Additions to single-unit and two-unit dwellings shall
maintain the architectural style, scale, and building mass of the existing
structure. The exterior building materials, colors, trim, and other
architectural details of the addition must complement the existing structure.
All additions must meet the requirements of this subsection B.
   C.   Design Requirements For Multiple-Unit Dwellings And Townhouse Dwelling
Units:
      1.   Facade Articulation: To avoid the appearance of blank walls on
multiple-unit and townhouse dwelling units, facades facing the front yard and
corner side yard must include articulation of the facade, such as entrances,
bay windows, porches, or other architectural features.
      2.   Facade Transparency: Minimum transparency is required on facades
facing the front yard, corner side yard, and interior side yard. Minimum
transparency of fifteen percent (15%) is required on facades facing the front
yard and corner side yard. Minimum transparency of ten percent (10%) is
required on facades facing the interior side yard. Security shutters, gates,
grills, or other similar security features, as deemed applicable by the Zoning
Administrator, shall not be fully opaque and shall not be affixed to the
exterior of any building façade.
      3.   Unified Design: The facades of multiple-unit and townhouse dwelling
units shall utilize common architectural forms, elements, materials, and colors
that wrap around all facades of the building to provide a unified architectural
design when the development is viewed from all directions.
      4.   Building Separation: In developments with more than one building,
there must be a minimum separation of forty feet (40') between two (2) front
facades, two (2) rear facades, a front and rear facade, a front and side
facade, or a rear and side facade. There must be a minimum separation of ten
feet (10') between two (2) side facades. Driveways and parking areas may be
located within this minimum building separation area.
      5.   Doors, Windows, And Balconies: Doors and windows must have frames
with raised elements, such as jambs, entablatures, thresholds, and casings, to
create articulation. Windows must be set back into or projected out from the
facade to provide facade depth and shadow. Bay windows and balconies are
encouraged to provide dimensional elements on a facade.
      6.   Roofs: Roof forms must be articulated so that varied planes and
massing within the overall roof are provided. Large monotonous roofs and simple
pitched roofs without breaks in the expanse of the roof are prohibited. For
flat roofs, the use of cornices and/or parapets is required to break up the
roofline.

   A.   Applicability: The design requirements in this section apply to all new
construction and significant exterior renovation of existing structures within
the Village's C-1 and C-2 Districts, with the exception of single-unit
dwellings, two-unit dwellings, townhouse dwelling units, and multiple-unit
dwellings. See sections
10-6-17, "C-1 Downtown Mixed-Use District", and
10-6-18, "C-2 Commercial District", of this chapter for additional design
requirements specific to each Commercial Zoning District. See section
10-6-9, "Design Requirements For Residential Zoning Districts", of this chapter
for design requirements specific to single-unit dwellings, two-unit dwellings,
townhouse dwelling units, and multiple-unit dwellings within the Village's
Commercial Zoning Districts.
   B.   Design Requirements:
      1.   Facade Design:
         a.   Defined Base, Middle, And Top: Buildings with multiple stories
shall be designed with a distinct base (ground story), middle, and top. The
base of the building shall be defined from the upper stories by a horizontal
expression line, which is a decorative, three-dimensional linear element
protruding or indented at least two inches (2") from a building facade. The top
of the building shall be crowned with a similar expression line no less than
six inches (6") in width.
         b.   Facade Articulation: For buildings with more than fifty feet
(50') of building width or depth, vertical architectural or structural elements
must be incorporated along all street-facing facades at regular intervals to
divide large, flat wall planes. Examples of such elements include texture
change, material change, color change, or wall articulation change, such as an
offset, pilaster, column, reveal, or vertical expression line, of no less than
six inches (6").
      2.   Building Facade Materials:
         a.   Allowed Materials: The following materials are allowed on any
building facade: durable and natural materials, such as stone, brick, stucco,
metal, concrete, burnished concrete masonry units, and non-reflective glass,
unless otherwise limited by subsection B2b, "Limited Materials", of this
section.
         b.   Limited Materials: The following materials may only be utilized
for trim or architectural details, and shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of
the total area of any building facade: utility brick, vinyl or metal siding,
metal wall panels, exposed aggregate (rough finish) concrete wall panels, non-
burnished concrete masonry units, exterior insulation and finishing systems,
fiberglass, plastic, untreated wood, and mirrored glass. The painting of brick,
limestone, or other natural stone is prohibited so such materials retain their
natural colors.
         c.   Security shutters, gates, grills, or other similar security
features, as deemed applicable by the Zoning Administrator, shall not be fully
opaque and shall not be affixed to the exterior of any building façade.
      3.   Building Details: Pedestrian-scale elements, such as decorative
lighting not more than nine feet (9') in height, planters, and awnings, shall
be included on any building facade fronting a public right-of-way.
      4.   Roof Design: Green roof, white roof, and blue roof designs are
encouraged.
   C.   Explanation Of Table Requirements: The following information explains
the commercial design requirements established in section
10-6-17, table 10-6-17-1, "C-1 District Requirements", and section
10-6-18, table 10-6-18-1, "C-2 District Requirements", of this chapter. Refer
to figures 10-6-16-1, "Commercial Design Requirements: Front Elevation View",
and 10-6-16-2, "Commercial Design Requirements: 3-D View", of this section.
      1.   Minimum Street Frontage: The minimum proportion of a principal
building required to be located adjacent to a right-of-way expressed as a
percentage of the total length of the lot line adjacent to the right-of-way.
      2.   Parking Location: The yards in which an off-street parking lot is
allowed.
      3.   Minimum Transparency: The amount of highly transparent, non-
reflective glass required as a percentage of the total area of the street-
facing ground story facades between two feet (2') and eight feet (8') above
grade. Tinting of glass in excess of twenty percent (20%) is prohibited.
Buildings larger than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet shall be exempt from
these standards.
      4.   Principal Entrance Location: The facade on which the principal
building entrance must be located.

10-8-3: PARKING REDUCTIONS:
The off-street parking requirements established in subsection
10-8-2C, table 10-8-2-1, "Off-Street Parking Requirements", of this chapter may
be reduced by the following measures with prior written approval by the Zoning
Administrator. One or more parking reduction measures may be utilized to
completely eliminate the off-street parking requirement for the specified use.
   A.   C-1 District Exemption: The requirements of subsection
10-8-2C, table 10-8-2-1, "Off-Street Parking Requirements", of this chapter
shall not apply to non-residential uses in the C-1 District.
   B.   Proximity To A Commuter Rail Station: Non-residential uses that are
located within one-half (1/2) mile of a commuter rail station, as measured from
any point along the lot line, may reduce the total number of off-street parking
spaces required by twenty five percent (25%).
   C.   Proximity To A Bus Stop: Non-residential uses that are located within
five hundred feet (500') of a public transit bus stop with regular, scheduled
service, as measured from any point along the lot line, may reduce the total
number of off-street parking spaces required by five percent (5%).
   D.   Proximity To A Municipal Parking Lot: Non-residential uses that are
located within five hundred feet (500') of a Municipally-owned parking lot, as
measured from any point along the lot line, may reduce the total number of off-
street parking spaces required by twenty five percent (25%).
   E.   Electric Vehicle Charging Station: Each parking space used as an
electric vehicle charging station may be counted as three (3) off-street
parking spaces, provided that the space is reserved exclusively for electric
vehicle charging purposes, for a credit of up to ten percent (10%) of the total
number of required off- street spaces.
   F.   Land-Banked Parking: Non-residential uses that provide land- banked
parking may reduce the total number of off-street parking spaces required by
twenty five percent (25%). The applicant must provide sufficient evidence that
supports the need for the parking reduction. The area proposed for land-banked
parking must be suitable for conversion to parking facilities in the future.
The land-banked area must be landscaped, but this area shall not be used to
fulfill the landscape requirements of chapter 9, "Landscape Standards", of this
title. Land-banked parking areas shall not be used for outdoor storage. The
Zoning Administrator is authorized to require the conversion of all or part of
the land-banked area to off-street parking spaces within six (6) months of
notification from the Village. The applicant may convert the land-banked
parking area to parking prior to Village notification. A written agreement for
land-banked parking shall be executed between the applicant and the Village in
a format satisfactory to the Village Attorney and shall be recorded in the
Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Cook or DuPage County, as applicable.
   G.   Fee-In-Lieu: A fee-in-lieu of providing parking spaces may be permitted
with written approval of the Zoning Administrator. The fee required shall be
based upon a uniform fee per parking space established annually by the Village
Board. Such payment shall be placed into a fund to be used by the Village for
the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of public off-street parking
lots within the same zoning district as the subject use or within adjacent
zoning districts of reasonable proximity to serve the subject use. The property
granted the reduction in the number of required off-street spaces shall be
credited permanently by ordinance with the number of spaces for which payment
was received by the Village.
   H.   Car-Share: Uses that provide car-share parking spaces may reduce the
total number of required parking spaces by five (5) parking spaces for each
car-share parking space provided. The applicant shall provide documentation of
an agreement with a car- share company in a format approved by the Village
Attorney. If this agreement should terminate at any point, then the applicant
shall either arrange an agreement with another car-share company to avoid
service interruption, or meet the minimum parking requirements established by
this chapter. (Ord. 67-2018, 12-18-2018)
10-8-4: SHARED PARKING:
   A.   Applicability: Shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of
required parking spaces in situations where a zoning lot is occupied by two (2)
or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same
time. A reduction of the total required off-street parking spaces may be
granted by the Zoning Administrator through an application for site plan review
(see section
10-3-2, "Site Plan Review", of this title).
   B.   General Requirements: The following requirements apply to all shared
parking agreements.
      1.   Any change in ownership or use of a lot shall cause the applicant or
property owner to meet the minimum parking requirements established by this
chapter, or arrange a new shared parking agreement. In the event that a change
in ownership or use should occur, the applicant or property owner must provide
written notification to the Zoning Administrator. Within sixty (60) days of
that notice, the applicant shall provide a satisfactory resolution to the
Zoning Administrator that provides adequate parking.
      2.   Shared parking may be located off-site provided that it complies
with the location requirements of subsection
10-8-2A3, "Off-Premises Parking Facilities", of this chapter.
   C.   Shared Parking Among Lots Under Different Ownership: When a shared
parking reduction is applied to uses on lots under different ownership, the
following shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator:
      1.   A site plan that provides for interconnected lots.
      2.   Recorded easements that provide cross-access among the parking
facilities to permit vehicular and pedestrian access.
      3.   Allocation of maintenance responsibilities.
   D.   Calculation: When any land or building is used for two (2) or more uses
that are listed in table 10-8-4-1, "Shared Parking Calculation", of this
subsection, the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be
determined by the following procedure:
      1.   Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use by the
appropriate percentage listed in table 10-8-4-1, "Shared Parking Calculation",
of this subsection for each of the designated time periods.
      2.   Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five (5) time periods
in each column. The minimum parking requirement is the highest of these total.

   E.   Special Shared Parking Study: As an alternative to the methodology
established in subsection D, "Calculation", of this section, an applicant may
submit a special shared parking study to the Zoning Administrator to
demonstrate that the parking demand for two (2) or more uses is less than the
cumulative parking requirements for each individual use. The special shared
parking study shall be conducted by a qualified professional at the applicant's
expense. (Ord. 67-2018, 12-18-2018)
10-8-5: REQUIRED BICYCLE PARKING:
   A.   Applicability: Minimum bicycle parking requirements shall apply to the
use categories in table 10-8-5-1, "Bicycle Parking Requirements", of this
section, provided that those use categories meet the development thresholds
listed in subsection
10-8-1B, "Applicability", of this chapter. If a use is not listed in table 10-
8-5-1, "Bicycle Parking Requirements", of this section then bicycle parking is
not required for that use.
   B.   Minimum Requirement: Where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of
two (2) spaces shall be provided.
   C.   Computation: Bicycle parking requirements for residential uses shall be
based on the total number of dwelling units in the development.
   D.   Bicycle Parking Design: Bicycle parking spaces shall be designed in
accordance with the following requirements:
      1.   Dimensions: Each bicycle parking space shall have a minimum width of
two feet (2'), minimum length of six feet (6'), and minimum vertical clearance
of seven feet (7'), see figure 10-8-5-1, "Bicycle Parking Design", of this
subsection.
      2.   Safe Access: Bicycle parking spaces shall be protected from motor
vehicle traffic and located to permit safe access to and from the use served. A
sidewalk, shared path, or other means of access, with a minimum width of five
feet (5'), shall be provided adjacent to bicycle parking facilities to ensure
adequate maneuvering space.
      3.   Racks And Structures: Secure racks and supporting structures shall
be provided for each bicycle parking space, and shall be designed to
accommodate both chain and U-shaped locks. Bicycle parking spaces shall permit
the bicycle frame and one wheel to be locked to the rack and supporting
structure. A locked bicycle shall be supported in a stable position without
damage to the wheels, frame, or components.
      4.   Visibility And Maintenance: Areas used for bicycle parking shall be
designed and maintained to be well-lit and reasonably free from standing water,
mud, and dust.

   E.   Short-Term Bicycle Parking: The following standards apply to required
short-term bicycle parking spaces, as established in table 10-8-5-1, "Bicycle
Parking Requirements", of this section.
      1.   Location: Short-term bicycle parking shall be located in a highly
visible, publicly-accessible location within fifty feet (50') of the principal
entrance to a building containing the use it serves. For buildings or uses
requiring more than eight (8) short-term bicycle parking spaces, parking spaces
in excess of these eight (8) spaces may be located more than fifty feet (50')
from the principal building entrance.
      2.   Spaces Within The Right-Of-Way: With the permission of the Village
Engineer, the property owner may install the required short-term bicycle
parking spaces within the public right-of-way.
      3.   Credit For Existing Public Parking Facilities: With the permission
of the Village Engineer, the property owner may receive credit for existing
public bicycle parking spaces located in the right-of-way, or on Village
property, to comply with the required short-term bicycle parking.
      4.   Fee-In-Lieu: A fee-in-lieu of providing short-term bicycle parking
spaces may be permitted with written approval of the Zoning Administrator. The
fee required shall be based upon a uniform fee per short-term bicycle space
established annually by the Village Board. Such payment shall be placed into a
fund to be used by the Village for the acquisition, construction, and
maintenance of short-term bicycle parking located in the public right-of-way,
or on Village owned property within the same zoning district as the subject use
or within adjacent zoning districts of reasonable proximity to serve the
subject use. The property granted the reduction in the number of required
short-term bicycle parking spaces shall be credited permanently by ordinance
with the number of spaces for which payment was received by the Village.
   F.   Long-Term Bicycle Parking: The following standards apply to required
long-term bicycle parking spaces, as established in table 10-8-5-1, "Bicycle
Parking Requirements", of this section.

   B.   Materials: All off-street parking lots, loading areas, drive- through
facilities, and driveways shall be constructed using a hard surface, all-
weather, dustless material.
      1.   Recycled Materials: Asphalt paving that is utilized for parking
facilities is encouraged to contain a minimum of twenty percent (20%) recycled
materials.
      2.   Pervious Materials: Pervious materials may be used for parking
facilities subject to the prior written approval of the Zoning Administrator.
   C.   Access:
      1.   Parking Lots: Parking lots shall be designed with adequate means of
vehicular access from a driveway, street, or alley in a manner that minimizes
interference with traffic movement. Parking facilities must be designed to
allow the driver to proceed forward into traffic from an access point, rather
than backing out. Parking facilities that serve single-unit, two-unit, and
townhouse dwellings are exempt from this requirement.
      2.   Parking Spaces: Each parking space within a parking lot shall open
directly into an aisle or driveway of sufficient width to provide adequate
means of vehicular access to the parking space.
   D.   Striping: Off-street parking lots shall delineate parking spaces with
paint or another permanent, durable material, which shall be maintained in
order to remain clearly visible.
E.   Wheel Stops, Bumper Stops, And Curbing: Wheel stops, bumper stops, and/or
curbing shall be permanently and securely installed along the perimeter of
parking lots to prevent vehicles from encroaching on sidewalks, landscape
areas, fencing, walls, or buildings. The zoning administrator may approve an
alternate configuration including the use of bollards to prevent vehicles from

authorized in this Chapter, the Village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all

Village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in

been paid that was not due under the provisions of this Chapter, whether as a

credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this Chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the Village Manager may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such

period of limitations.

amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village plus five percent (5%)
of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs
incurred by the Village in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed
five percent (5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an
audit. Said sum shall be paid to the Village within twenty one (21) days after

five feet (5') may be authorized by the village director where he determines
that the aboveground service facility has been engineered so as to not create
an unreasonable risk of harm to the underground lines.
   C.   No facility shall be installed underground where there is inadequate
space to permit access maintenance and replacement of existing underground
utilities or facilities or where the placement of an aboveground facility
threatens the pedestrian or vehicular safety.
   D.   Where aboveground service facilities would require a variation for
installation on private property within a zoning district contiguous to a
public way, no large aboveground mounted facility shall be installed within the
public way without a variation granted by the village board. This variation
shall be considered a major variation to be determined by the village board and
shall be subject to all procedural and variation standards set forth in title
10 of this code.
   E.   No transmission tower shall be permitted in any public way.
   F.   Personal wireless service facilities may be located on an existing

on an existing single utility pole;
      7.   No personal wireless facility shall be installed within three
hundred feet (300') of an existing personal wireless facility or within three
hundred feet (300') of a site specific location already granted a permit for a
personal wireless facility; and
      8.   The owner of the facilities proposed to be mounted on an existing
utility pole of a current franchisee or licensee shall provide the village
evidence of written permission of the franchisee or licensee of the proposed
use and the owner of the facilities proposed to be mounted on an existing
utility pole shall enter into a license agreement as required by this chapter
and shall secure a site specific permit as required by the license agreement.
An applicant for a site specific permit under the terms and conditions of the
license agreement shall submit its written agreement with the franchisee or
licensee, which owns the existing utility pole as part of its site specific
permit application.
   G.   No variations of the foregoing prohibitions may be granted by the

Fully completed permit applications shall be examined and rejected or approved
by the village director within a reasonable time after the filing thereof, but
in no event later than any period specified for rejection or approval in an
applicable federal regulation or state statute. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the village director shall reject such application as
incomplete in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the village director is
satisfied that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter and
all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the village
director shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. (Ord. 44-2016,

   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with village ordinances to the extent of the village's
property rights therein. The permit shall not create a property right or grant
authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an
interest in the public ways, including, but not limited to, such rights as may
exist by virtue of the Illinois highway code 1 .
   B.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the

In the event the actual size, type, material, or location of any facilities
deviate in a minor way with respect to the size, type, material, or location
identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit
application, the permittee shall request a field change from the village
director and shall thereafter submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the
village within thirty (30) days after the completion of the permitted work. The
revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of
the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. This
section shall not be used as a substitute for nonfield variations. If the
village director deems a variation to be major or material, it shall be subject
to approval or rejection by the corporate authorities of the village. If any
such proposed deviation does not satisfy the requirements of the definition of
a "field change", it shall be treated as a request for a variance in accordance
with section
12-10-22 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance,
then the permittee shall, within thirty (30) days of said denial, either remove
the facility from the public way or modify the facility so that it conforms to
the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. Any reasonable out of
pocket costs, including outside engineering fees, attorney fees, document
preparation fees, court reporter fees, and notice or publication fees incurred
by the village as a result of the installation of a facility in violation of
this chapter, and for which no variation is granted, shall be paid to the

written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not
to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the entity shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section. In the event that the entity fails to
obtain or produce evidence of said replacement insurance, any permits issued
pursuant to this chapter shall, without any further notice, be null and void.

insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. An entity that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insured under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections
B, C and D of this section. An entity that elects to self-insure shall provide
to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit required under subsection A of
this section, such as evidence that the entity is a "private self-insurer"
under the workers' compensation act. Self-insurance shall be primary, and any
village policies of insurance shall be deemed noncontributory.
   E.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the entity to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. (Ord. 44-2016, 10-

12-10-11: SECURITY FUNDS:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit and until
the facilities are removed as provided in this chapter. The security fund shall
serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter,
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter, and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a sole consequence of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form of cash or in another form acceptable to the village.
   C.   Amount:
      1.   Construction And Restoration Security Fund: The dollar amount of the
construction and restoration security fund shall be sufficient to provide for
the reasonably estimated cost to restore the public way to at least as good a
condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as
determined by the village director, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village director
may allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be
applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection C for any
single phase.
      2.   Removal Security Fund: The dollar amount of the removal security
fund, as determined by the village director, shall be sufficient to provide for
the reasonably estimated cost to remove the facilities and restore the public
way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to such removal in
the event the permittee or its successor abandons the facilities or otherwise
refuses to remove the facilities where such removal is required under this
chapter or under a license agreement. The dollar amount of the removal security
fund, as determined by the village director, may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred, if
the permittee fails to perform such removal.

with fourteen (14) days advance written notice stating the reason for, and its
intention to, exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection. Upon such
notice, the village may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within said
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee, or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment Of Security Fund: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt
of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the
security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount
specified in subsection C of this section.
   F.   Closing And Return Of Security Funds:
      1.   Construction And Restoration Security Fund: Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return

remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all
offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to
comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the
event of any revocation of the permit, the construction and restoration
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
      2.   Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the removal of the
facilities and restoration of the public way the permittee shall be entitled to
the return of the construction and restoration security fund, or such portion
thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken
for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the
permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable
law.
   G.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security funds are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security funds shall
affect any other right the village may have. (Ord. 44-2016, 10-25-2016)
12-10-12: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:
   A.   Right To Revoke Permit: The village director may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application,
      2.   Noncompliance with one or more provisions of this chapter,
      3.   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public way presents
a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or

12-10-18: VEGETATION CONTROL:
   A.   Tree Trimming Permit Required: Notwithstanding any other provision to
the contrary of this code, tree trimming shall not be considered a normal
maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance
of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society Of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   B.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   C.   Chemical Use: Spraying of any type of vegetation killing chemicals will
not be permitted on public ways unless approved by the village director and in
such case only in conformance with the manual specifications and EPA
regulations. (Ord. 44-2016, 10-25-2016)

village, any person or entity installing, controlling or maintaining any
facility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any facilities within the public ways
whenever the village director determines that such removal, relocation, change
or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair,
maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the village in or upon, the public ways.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village director, to any person or entity that owns,
controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances
within the public way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such
facilities or appurtenances from the public ways. A facility is unauthorized
and subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter;
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise; or
      5.   Upon abandonment of the facility, abandonment will be presumed where
a facility has not been used for the purpose for which it was installed for a
period of sixty (60) consecutive days, or more, and where there have been no
efforts to repair or renew the use during the sixty (60) day period. The entity
owning, controlling or maintaining the facility shall have the burden of
establishing to the village director that the facility is still being used
within thirty (30) days of the notice. All notices described herein shall be
regular U.S. mail. Failure to respond to the village director's request for
information regarding the abandonment of the facility shall constitute
irrefutable evidence of abandonment. Upon the village director's determination
and final written notification to the entity of such abandonment the entity
shall have sixty (60) days within which to:
         a.   Reactivate the use of the facility or transfer the facility to
another entity which makes actual use of the facility promptly, or
         b.   Dismantle and remove the facility and notify the village director
in writing of the completion of such removal.
If the entity fails to reactivate, or transfer to another active user or remove
the service facility the village shall have the right to have the service
facility removed at the entity's expense. The village shall be entitled to
reimbursement for all costs and expenses associated with the removal and the
storage of any facility thereafter. If a stored facility is not picked up from
the village within twenty eight (28) days of removal, the village may dispose
of the facility in its discretion. The village at that point will also be
entitled to the cost of the disposal less any value the village secures for the
facility for scrap or resale. In addition, an administrative fee shall be
assessed against the entity for disposal of the service facility in an amount
equal to the staff time related to all proceedings associated with the removal
and disposal of the facility. Failure to remove an abandoned facility in
conformance with this chapter shall be considered a violation of this code and
subject to its general penalty provisions. No permit for any work in the
village shall be granted to an entity including its successors, which owes any
sum of money to the village for the removal and disposal of an abandoned
facility.
   C.   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the public
ways of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the village shall attempt to notify the entity, if known,
prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the entity, if known,
after cutting or removing a facility. (Ord. 44-2016, 10-25-2016)
12-10-20: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
Upon completion of all construction, maintenance or removal of facilities, the
entity shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain in a
timely manner and to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration
of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made
using materials and methods approved by the village director. Such cleanup and
repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding,
resodding, or any other requirement to restore the public way to a condition
substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the
project and according to village standards. (Ord. 44-2016, 10-25-2016)
12-10-21: MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:

within public ways are to be maintained by or for the entity at the entity's
sole expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
public way, the entity shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the public way including
the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on
the traveled way but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the
parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate
signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the entity shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village director or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. On
weekends the entity shall notify the police of an emergency if the village
director is unavailable. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified
immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the entity shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public immediately.

description of the repairs undertaken in the public way within forty eight (48)
hours after an emergency repair.
   D.   Landscape Maintenance: All landscaping installed pursuant to this
chapter shall be maintained by the person or entity owning, controlling or
maintaining the adjacent facility in good and reasonable condition. Any person
or entity failing to maintain any such landscaping after receiving written
notice from the village director that the landscaping is in need of maintenance
shall not be issued any permits for the installation of new facilities until
the deficient landscaping has been restored to good and reasonable condition.
(Ord. 44-2016, 10-25-2016)
12-10-22: VARIANCES:
   A.   Request For Variance: An entity requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the village director
as part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The village director shall decide whether
a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The village director may authorize
a minor variance only if the entity requesting the variance has demonstrated
that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the entity (such as
terrain features or an irregular public way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform to the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the village director may require the entity requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   E.   Variation Requests: If the village director determines that the
variance request is a major variance, the variation request shall be determined
by the village board in conformance with subsections C1 and C2 of this section
and the variation standards set forth in title 10 of this code. (Ord. 44-2016,
10-25-2016)
12-10-23: PENALTIES:
Any person or entity who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to
comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of
not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense, and a separate offense shall be deemed
committed for each and every day during which a violation continues or exists.
There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including
third party claims, because the entity will not or cannot perform its duties
under its permit and this chapter. Unless the entity shows that another
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the
entity shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review
or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may
be imposed upon an entity who does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord.

         h.   The identification and a description of the source of power for
the collocation of each proposed small wireless facility and any backhaul work
anticipated to be performed. If a source of power or backhaul is necessary for
the collocation of a proposed small wireless facility, the wireless provider is
required to submit a separate permit application.
      2.   Application Process: The Village shall process applications as
follows:
         a.   Prioritization: The first completed application shall have
priority over applications received by different applicants for collocation on
the same utility pole or wireless support structure.
         b.   Existing Poles Or Structures: An application to collocate a small
wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or
replacement of an existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be
processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the
Village fails to approve or deny the application within ninety (90) days after
the submission of a completed application. However, if an applicant intends to
proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant
shall notify the Village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed
approved remedy no sooner than seventy five (75) days after the submission of a
completed application. The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the
ninetieth (90th) day after submission of the complete application or the tenth
(10th) day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the Village. The
receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the Village's denial
of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         c.   New Utility Poles: An application to collocate a small wireless
facility that includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be
processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the Village fails
to approve or deny the application within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the submission of a completed application. However, if an applicant intends to
proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant
shall notify the Village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed
approved remedy no sooner than one hundred five (105) days after the submission
of a completed application. The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter
of the one hundred twentieth (120th) day after submission of the complete
application or the tenth (10th) day after the receipt of the deemed approved
notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not
preclude the Village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as
provided under this chapter.
         d.   Application Denied: The Village shall deny an application which
does not meet the requirements of this chapter. If the Village determines that
applicable codes, ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the
collocation requirements and conditions contained herein require that the
utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before the requested
collocation, approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility
pole or wireless support structure at the cost of the provider. The Village
shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions
or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the
documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies an
application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village
and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty
(30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed
approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days
of denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and recommencement of the Village's review period. The
applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed with
the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with
the revised application. Any review of a revised application shall be limited
to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application cure
does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or
different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless
equipment associated with the small wireless facility.
         e.   Pole Attachment Agreement: Within thirty (30) days after approval
of an application for a permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a
Municipal utility pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter into a Master
Pole Attachment Agreement, provided by the Village for the initial collocation
on a Municipal utility pole by the applicant. For subsequent approved permits
to collocate a small wireless facility on a Municipal utility pole, the Village
and the applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole
Attachment Agreement. The Village Manager shall be authorized to execute the
foregoing agreements without further approval by the Corporate Authorities of
the Village. Said execution by the Village Manager shall be deemed to
constitute the approval of the respective agreement by the Corporate
Authorities.
      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the
Village sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides
the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         b.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      5.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. If an
application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may remove
small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately
small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been
provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied.
The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in
a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter. If
the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits
shall be subject to the applicable Village code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village at the Village
Hall by personal delivery or by regular mail postmarked on the date due.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970
through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The Village may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations
cited in the previous sentence. Failure to remedy the interference as required
herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Collocation Specifications: The wireless provider shall not
collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of
an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker
safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. However, the
antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in
the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the top of the
pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with
applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this
subsection, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety
zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the
National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Complying With Applicable Codes: The wireless provider shall comply
with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern
public safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan, or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. At a
minimum, a wireless provider shall comply with the following standards:
         a.   Small Wireless Facility Equipment: A wireless provider shall,
whenever possible, locate the base of the equipment or appurtenances at a
height of no lower than eight feet (8') above grade.
         b.   Small Wireless Facilities Mounted At Grade: In the event that the
wireless provider proposes to install a facility where equipment or
appurtenances are to be installed at grade, screening must be installed to
minimize the visibility of the facility. Screening must be installed at least
three feet (3') from the equipment installed at-grade and eight feet (8') from
a roadway.
         c.   Color: The small wireless facility, including all related
equipment and appurtenances, must be a color that blends with the surroundings
of the pole, structure, tower or infrastructure on which it is mounted and use
non-reflective materials which blend with the materials and colors of the
surrounding area and structures. Any wiring must be covered with an appropriate
cover or cable shield.
         d.   Antenna Panel Covering: A small wireless facility antenna may
include a radome, cap or other antenna panel covering or shield, to the extent
such covering would not result in a larger or more noticeable facility and, if
proposed, such covering must be of a color that blends with the color of the
pole, structure, tower or infrastructure on which it is mounted.
         e.   Wiring And Cabling: Wires and cables connecting the antenna to
the remainder of the facility must be installed in accordance with the
Electrical Code currently in effect in the Village. No wiring and cabling
serving the facility will be allowed to interfere with any wiring or cabling
installed by a cable television or video service operator, electric utility or
telephone utility.
         f.   Grounding: The small wireless facility must be grounded in
accordance with the requirements of the Electrical Code currently in effect in
the Village.
         g.   Guy Wires: No guy or other support wires will be used in
connection with a small wireless facility unless the facility is to be attached
to an existing utility pole, wireless support structure, or Village-owned
infrastructure that incorporated guy wires prior to the date that an applicant
has applied for a permit.
         h.   Pole Extensions: Extensions to utility poles, wireless support
structures, and Village-owned infrastructure utilized for the purpose of
connecting a small wireless facility antenna and its related small wireless
facility equipment must have a degree of strength capable of supporting the
antenna and any related appurtenances and cabling and capable of withstanding
wind forces and ice loads in accordance with the applicable structural
integrity standards, as set forth in subsection C6i, "Structural Integrity", of
this section. An extension must be securely bound to the utility pole, wireless
support structure, or Village-owned infrastructure in accordance with
applicable engineering standards for the design and attachment of such
extensions.
         i.   Structural Integrity: The small wireless facility, including the
antenna, pole extension and all related equipment must be designed to withstand
a wind force and ice loads in accordance with applicable standards established
in chapter 25 of the National Electric Safety Code for utility poles, rule 250-
B and 250-C standards governing wind, ice, and loading forces on utility poles,
in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in TIA/EIA section 222-
G established by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the
Electronics Industry Association (EIA) for steel wireless support structures
and the applicable industry standard for other existing structures. For any
facility attached to Village-owned infrastructure or, in the discretion of the
Village, for a utility pole or wireless support structure, the operator of the
facility must provide the Village with a structural evaluation of each specific
location containing a recommendation that the proposed installation passes the
standards described above. The evaluation must be prepared by a professional
structural engineer licensed in the State of Illinois.
         j.   Signage: Other than signs required by Federal law or regulations
or identification and location markings, installation of signs on a small
wireless facility is prohibited.
         k.   Screening: If screening is required under subsection C6b of this
section, it must be natural landscaping material or a fence subject to the
approval of the Village and must comply with all other regulations of the
Village. Appropriate landscaping must be located and maintained and must
provide the maximum achievable screening, as determined by the Village, from
view of adjoining properties and public or private streets. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such screening is required to extend more than nine feet (9') in
height. Landscape screening when permitted in the right-of-way must be provided
with a clearance of three feet (3') in all directions from the facility. The
color of housing for ground-mounted equipment must blend with the surroundings.
For a covered structure, the maximum reasonably achievable screening must be
provided between such facility and the view from adjoining properties and
public or private streets. In lieu of the operator installing the screening,
the Village, at its sole discretion, may accept a fee from the operator of the
facility for the acquisition, installation, or maintenance of landscaping
material by the Village.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. If the
applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant shall
provide a written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this subsection.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or
replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small

         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height in
excess of the above height limitations for a new or replacement pole on which
the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for such applicable relief in conformance with the procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable section or sections of this Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable

      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty

all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter. A wireless provider that
has an existing agreement with the Village on June 1, 2018 may accept the
rates, fees and terms that the Village makes available under this chapter for
the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility
poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of
an application submitted two (2) or more years after June 1, 2018 by notifying
the Village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing
agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for
the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the
Village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village
before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option
under this subsection.
   G.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to
the wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole. If the
Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the rate
shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after the first
annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   H.   Abandonment:
      1.   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the
facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety (90) days after
receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the owner of the
abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
owner. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days of
such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
      2.   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if
it sells or transfers small wireless facilities subject to this chapter within
the jurisdictional boundary of the Village. Such notice shall include the name
and contact information of the new wireless provider. (Ord. 35-2018, 8-14-2018)
12-13-4: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
The Circuit Court of DuPage County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve
all disputes arising under the Act and this chapter. Pending resolution of a
dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on
Municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the Village shall allow the
collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than
two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal utility pole, with rates
to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute. (Ord. 35-2018, 8-14-
2018)
12-13-5: INDEMNIFICATION:
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against any
and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right- of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability. (Ord. 35-2018, 8-14-2018)
12-13-6: INSURANCE:
   A.   A wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      1.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      2.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      3.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with the Village's requirements of other users of
Village improvements or rights-of- way, including coverage for bodily injury
and property damage. The wireless provider shall include the Village as an
additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide
certification and documentation of inclusion of the Village in a commercial
general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
   B.   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required by the Village. A wireless provider
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under this
section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limits required by the Village. (Ord. 35-2018, 8-14-
2018)
12-13-7: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be
given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid
provision or invalid application of this chapter is severable. (Ord. 35-2018,

date shall be indicated on the violation notice.
Hearings shall be scheduled with reasonable promptness, provided that for
hearings scheduled in all non-emergency situations, if requested by the
defendant, the defendant shall have at least fifteen (15) days after service of
process to prepare for a hearing. A "non-emergency situation" means any
situation that does not reasonably constitute a threat to the public interest,

evidence relevant to the existence of a code violation. A hearing officer may
set aside any judgment entered by default and set a new hearing date, upon a

appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time if the petitioner

shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been
recorded for any debt due and owing the municipality as a result of the vacated
