matter be changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision. ('69
Code, § 1-3)
§ 10.11 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, chapters, or sections of the codified

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

§ 30.18 ELECTRONIC ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS.
   (A)   Rules Statement. It is the decision of the City of Tuscola, Illinois
that any member of the City Council of the city may attend any open meeting of
the Council via electronic means (such as by telephone, video or internet
connection) provided that such attendance complies with these rules and any
applicable laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Council may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The member should notify the Clerk or City Administrator at least
three hours before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary
communications equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary
technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote
attendance.
      (2)   The member must assert one of the following four reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the city; or
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency;
or
         (d)   The member cannot attend because of unexpected childcare
obligations.
   (C)   Authorization to Participate.
      (1)   The Clerk, or City Administrator, after receiving the electronic
attendance request, shall inform the Council of the request for electronic
attendance.
      (2)   After establishing that there is a quorum physically present at a
meeting where a member of the Council desires to attend electronically, the
presiding officer shall state that (i) a notice was received from a member of
the Council in accordance with these rules, and (ii) the member will be deemed
authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to
the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded and approved by two-thirds
of the members of the Council physically present at the meeting. If no such
motion is made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the required
vote by the members of the Council physically present at the meeting, then the
request by the member to attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed
approved by the Council and the presiding officer shall declare the requesting
member present. After such declaration by the presiding officer, the question
of a member's electronic attendance may not be reconsidered.
   (D)   Adequate Equipment Required. The member participating electronically
and other members of the Council must be able to communicate effectively, and
members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting
site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the Council shall
provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic
means.
   (F)   Rights of Remote Member.
      (1)   A member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express
his or her comments during the meeting and participate in the same capacity as
those members physically present, subject to all general meeting guidelines and
procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The member attending
electronically shall be heard, considered and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called
during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the Clerk
and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member attending
electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member,
provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving
and returning.
      (2)   If a member cannot be physically present for a meeting, chooses to
participate in a meeting remotely, and there is a quorum physically present for
the meeting, but the reason for an absence from the meeting does not fall
within the prerequisites of division (B)(2) above, the member may still attend
remotely, participate in discussion and get paid for attendance at the meeting,
but not vote on any agenda item.
   (G)   Committees, Boards and Commissions. These rules shall apply to all
committees, boards and commissions established by authority of the Council.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
   Editor's Note: This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of
Human Rights Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to
Public Act 100-0554.
§ 31.100 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the city to prohibit harassment of
any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 2018-O-1, passed 1-8-18; Am. Ord. 2018-O-6, passed 11-13-18)
§ 31.101 DEFINITION.
   (A)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act.
      SEXUAL HARASSMENT. Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual
favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      (1)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
      (2)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises;
      (3)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
      (4)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault;
      (5)    Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
(Ord. 2018-O-1, passed 1-8-18; Am. Ord. 2018-O-6, passed 11-13-18)
§ 31.102 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by
clearly communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his
immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed
at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   (a)   Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.All
allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.

§ 31.103 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, RETALIATORY ACTION means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430 § 15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or
other
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174 § 15(a)), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a
court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal
law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (See ILCS
Ch. 740, Act 174 § 15(b))
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch.775, Act 5 § 6-
101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which
he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - either due within 300 days of the alleged
retaliation.
(Ord. 2018-O-1, passed 1-8-18; Am. Ord. 2018-O-6, passed 11-13-18)
§ 31.104 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or
the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430 § 5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. 2018-O-1, passed 1-8-18; Am. Ord. 2018-O-6, passed 11-13-18)
§ 31.105 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 35.01 ANNUAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
   The City Council shall, within the first quarter of each fiscal year, pass
an ordinance to be termed the “Annual Appropriation Bill,” in which shall be
appropriated such sum or sums of money as deemed necessary to defray all
expenses and liabilities of the city for the coming fiscal year. The ordinance
shall specify the objects and purposes for which appropriations are made, and
the amount appropriated for each object or purpose. No further appropriation
shall be made at any other time during the fiscal year, unless the proposition
to make the additional appropriation has been sanctioned by a majority of the
legal voters of the city, either by petition signed by them or at a special
election called therefor.
(‘69 Code, § 2-5)
Statutory reference:
   Appropriation, see ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-2-9
§ 35.02 LIMITATION; EMERGENCY; BORROWING.
   (A)   Neither the City Council nor any department or officer of the city
shall add to the city expenditures in any fiscal year anything over and above
the amount provided for in the annual appropriation bill for that year, except
as is hereinafter provided. No expenditure for an improvement to be paid for
out of the general fund of the city shall exceed in any fiscal year the amount
provided for that improvement in the annual appropriation bill. However,
nothing herein contained shall prevent the City Council from ordering, by a
two-thirds vote, any improvement, the necessity of which is caused by any
casualty or accident happening after the annual appropriation is made. The City
Council may, by a like vote, order the Mayor and Finance Committee to borrow a
sufficient amount to make such improvements, for a space of time not extending
beyond the close of the next fiscal year. The sum and the interest thereon
shall be added to the amount authorized to be raised in the next general tax
levy, and embraced therein.
   (B)   Should any judgment be obtained against the city, the Mayor and
Finance Committee, under the sanction of the City Council, may borrow a
sufficient sum to pay the same, for a space of time not exceeding the close of
the next fiscal year. The sum and interest thereon shall in like manner be
added to the amount authorized to be raised in the general tax levy of the next
year and embraced therein.
(ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-1-6) (‘69 Code, § 2-6)
§ 35.03 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION.
   During any fiscal year the City Council may adopt a supplemental
appropriation ordinance in an amount not in excess of the aggregate of any
additional revenue available to the city, or estimated to be received by the
city subsequent to the adoption of the annual appropriation ordinance for the
fiscal year. Such supplemental appropriation ordinance shall only affect
revenue that was not available for appropriation when the annual appropriations
ordinance was adopted.
(ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-2-7) (‘69 Code, § 2-7)
§ 35.04 LIMITATION ON CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   No contract shall be made by the City Council or any committee or
member thereof or by an officer or any department, whether the object of the
expenditure has been ordered or not, unless an appropriation has been
previously made concerning that expense, except as otherwise expressly
provided. Any contract made, or any expense otherwise incurred, in violation of
the provisions of this section shall be null and void as to the city, and no
money belonging thereto shall be paid on account thereof. However, pending the
passage of the annual appropriation ordinance for any fiscal year, the City
Council may authorize heads of departments or other separate agencies of the
city to make necessary expenditures for the support thereof upon the basis of
the appropriations of the preceding fiscal year. However, if it is determined
by two-thirds vote of the City Council then holding office at a regularly
scheduled meeting of the City Council that it is expedient and in the best
public interest to begin proceedings for the construction of a needed public
work, then the provisions of this section shall not apply to the extent that
the City Council may employ or contract for professional services necessary for
the planning and financing of such public work.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary, the City
Council may make contracts for a term exceeding one year and not exceeding the
term of the Mayor holding office at the time the contract is executed, relating
to:
      (1)   The employment of a municipal manager, administrator, engineer,
health officer, land planner, finance director, attorney, police chief or other
officer who requires technical training or knowledge;
      (2)   The employment of outside professional consultants such as
engineers, doctors, land planners, auditors, attorneys, or other professional
consultants who require technical training or knowledge;
      (3)   The provision of data processing equipment and services; or
      (4)   The provision of services which directly relate to the prevention,
identification or eradication of disease.
   In such case the City Council shall include in the annual appropriation
ordinance for each fiscal year, an appropriation of a sum of money sufficient
to pay the amount which, by the terms of the contract, is to become due and
payable during the current fiscal year.
   (C)   This section shall not apply to municipalities operating under special
charters.
   (D)   In order to promote orderly collective bargaining relationships, to
prevent labor strife, and to protect the interests of the public and the health
and safety of the citizens of the state, this section shall not apply to multi-
year collective bargaining agreements between public employers and exclusive
representatives governed by the provisions of the Illinois Public Labor
Relations Act.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, the
corporate authorities of any municipality may enter into multi-year collective
bargaining agreements with exclusive representatives under the provisions of
the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, the
corporate authorities of any municipality may enter into any multi-year
contract or otherwise associate for any term under the provisions of Section 10
of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution or the Intergovernmental
Cooperation Act, being ILCS Ch. 220, § 1 et seq.
(ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-1-7) (‘69 Code, § 2- 11)
§ 35.05 ANNUAL TAX LEVY.
   (A)   The City Council shall annually, on or before the second Tuesday in
December in each fiscal year, ascertain the total amount of appropriations for
all corporate purposes legally made and to be collected from the tax levy of
that fiscal year. By an ordinance specifying in detail the purposes for which
these appropriations are made and the sum or amount appropriated for each
purpose, the Council shall levy the amount so ascertained upon all the property
subject to taxation within the city as that property is assessed and equalized
for state and county purposes for the current year.
   (B)   A certified copy of this ordinance shall be filed with the County
Clerk, whose duty is shall be to ascertain the rate per cent which will produce
the amount so levied.
   (C)   The aggregate amount of taxes levied for any one year, exclusive of
the amount levied for the payment of bonded indebtedness or interest thereon,
and exclusive of taxes authorized by acts which by their terms provide that
such taxes shall be in addition to taxes for general purposes, shall not exceed
the rate of .333% upon the aggregate valuation of all property within the city
subject to taxation therein, as the property is equalized for state and county
taxes for the current year.
(ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-3-1) (‘69 Code, § 2-8)
§ 35.06 CLAIMS AGAINST CITY.
   (A)   No claim or account against the city, except for the salaries of its
regularly elected, appointed, and commissioned officers, or for the payment of
a special contract made by the City Council, or some officer of the city
authorized by ordinance to make contracts, shall be considered, audited or
allowed, nor shall any warrant issue for the payment thereof, unless the person
presenting the same or some credible person for him, makes an oath that such
claim or account is true, just and correct, and that the charges therein are
reasonable. Such warrant shall not issue until the claim or account has been
examined by at least two of the committees of the department to which the claim
or account appropriately belongs, and the committee has reported the claim back
to the Council, with its recommendation indorsed thereon and signed by the
members thereof. (‘69 Code, § 2-9)
   (B)   All claims against the city shall be filed with the City Clerk by the
morning of the days on which the regular meetings of the City Council are held.
It will be the duty of the chairman of each committee of the City Council to
apply to the City Clerk at that time for all claims appropriately referred to
that committee, to examine the correctness of the claims and to report to the
City Council. Claims not filed with the City Clerk at the time specified herein
shall not be considered at the regular meeting of the Council on that day, but
shall be laid over until the next regular meeting, unless otherwise ordered by
the City Council. (‘69 Code, § 2-10)
§ 35.07 DEMAND WARRANTS; LIMITATION.
   Warrants payable on demand shall be issued upon the City Treasurer only
when, at the time of the drawing and issuing of the warrants, there is
sufficient money in the appropriated fund to pay the warrants.
(ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-1-9) (‘69 Code, § 2- 12)
§ 35.08 ANTICIPATION WARRANTS.
   (A)   Whenever there is not sufficient money in the Treasury of the city to
meet and defray the ordinary and necessary expenses of the city, it shall be
lawful for the City Council to provide a fund to meet the expenses by issuing
and selling warrants drawn against and in anticipation of any taxes already
levied for the payment of the ordinary and necessary expenses of the city, to
the extent of 85% of the total amount of any tax so levied. Warrants drawn and
issued under this provision shall show upon their face that they are payable in
the numerical order of their issuance solely from the anticipated taxes when
these taxes are collected and not otherwise. These warrants shall be received
by any collector of taxes in payment of the taxes against which they are
issued, and the taxes against which these warrants are drawn shall be set apart
and held for their payment. (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-1-11) (‘69 Code, § 2-13)
   (B)   Every warrant issued under division (A) shall, unless paid within 30
days after its issuance, bear interest, payable only out of the taxes against
which it shall be drawn, at the applied rate per annum as provided by law from
the date of its issuance until paid, or until notice is given by publication in
a newspaper or otherwise, that the money for its payment is available, and that
it will be paid on presentation. (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 § 8-1-12) (‘69 Code, § 2-

§ 35.30 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing,
through audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the
time frame otherwise indicated.
   (A)   Interest. The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be 8%
per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.
   (B)   Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
(Ord. 01-0-01, passed 1-8-01)
§ 35.31 ABATEMENT.
   The local Tax Administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any

§ 35.32 INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local Tax
Administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local Tax Administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 working day period or fails to demonstrate
good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local Tax
Administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 01-0-01, passed 1-8-01)
§ 35.33 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   The city, through the local Tax Administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the reviewed
tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due and
owing.
   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than two
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the city,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall
be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return for the
applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 01-0-01, passed 1-8-01)
§ 35.34 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before
the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local Tax
Administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer.
(Ord. 01-0-01, passed 1-8-01)
§ 35.35 PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.

ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request City Clerk’s
office.
(Ord. 01-0-01, passed 1-8-01)
§ 35.36 REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   The local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local Tax Administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city’s expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. 01-0-01, passed 1-8-01)
§ 35.37 APPLICATION.

conflict with or inconsistent with this subchapter, this subchapter shall be
controlling.

INVESTMENT POLICY
§ 35.50 POLICY ESTABLISHED.
   It is the policy of the City of Tuscola to invest public funds in a manner
which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security
while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city and conforming to all
Illinois and local statues governing the investment of public funds.
(Ord. 99-O-17, passed - -99; Am. Ord. 2001-O-13, passed - -01)
§ 35.51 SCOPE.
   This investment policy applies to all investment activities of the city. All
financial assets of the following funds, as well as any other funds that may be
created, shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of this
policy:
   (A)   General Fund.
   (B)   Special Revenue Funds.
   (C)   Debt Service Funds.
   (D)   Capital Project Funds.
   (E)   Enterprise Funds.
   (F)   Any new fund created by Council, unless specifically exempted by
Council.
(Ord. 99-O-17, passed - -99; Am. Ord. 2001-O-13, passed - -01)
§ 35.52 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.
   The overall direction of the city investment policy may be found in the
following objectives, which have been explained to identify clearly the results
expected:
   (A)   Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment
policy. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital.
   (B)   Liquidity. The city’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements, which might be
reasonably anticipated.
   (C)   Return on investment. The city’s investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city’s investment risk
restraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (D)   Diversification. In order to further guarantee asset safety, the city
shall diversify investments to avoid incurring unreasonable risks from the
practice of concentrating investments in specific security types and/or
individual financial institutions.
   (E)   Public confidence in the investment program is imperative. The city
will avoid any transaction that might impair public confidence. Investments
shall be made with judgement and care, under circumstances then prevailing,
which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the
management of their own affairs. The standard, therefore, avoids unwarranted
speculation; emphasis is placed on the probable safety of capital rather than
the probable income to be derived.
(Ord. 99-O-17, passed - -99; Am. Ord. 2001-O-13, passed - -01)
§ 35.53 RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM.
   The establishment of investment policies is the responsibility of the Mayor
and City Council. Management responsibility for the investment program is
hereby delegated to the City Administrator, who shall establish written
procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this
investment policy. The procedures shall include explicit delegation of
authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may
engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this
policy and the procedures established by the City Administrator. The Treasurer
shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a
system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials.
(Ord. 99-O-17, passed - -99; Am. Ord. 2001-O-13, passed - -01)
§ 35.54 CASH MANAGEMENT.
   The City Treasurer or his or her designee shall prepare written cash
management procedures, which shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
   (A)   Receipts. All monies due the city shall be collected as promptly as
possible. Monies that are received shall be deposited in an approved financial
institution no later than the next business day after receipt by the city.
Amounts that remain uncollected after a reasonable length of time shall be
subject to any available legal means of collection previously approved by the
City Council. One of the objectives of the city’s cash management procedures is
to comply with the provisions of the Illinois Revised Statutes, which mandates
prompt investment of funds.
   (B)   Disbursements. Any disbursement to suppliers of goods and/or services
or to employees for salaries and wages shall be contingent upon available
budget appropriations.
   (C)   Financial forecast. At least annually, a financial forecast will be
prepared using expected revenue sources and items of expenditure to project
cash requirements for future years of the city. An analysis will be prepared
for both operating and non-operating revenues and expenditures. These analyses
will provide a guide for determining the length and amount of investments.
   (D)   Pooling of cash. Except where otherwise provided by the City Council,
the City Treasurer or his or her designee will be authorized to pool the cash
of various funds to maximize investment earnings where in his or her opinion it
is advantageous and prudent to do so. Investment income will be allocated to
the various funds based upon their respective participation. These investments,
directed by the City Treasurer or Council, may be on a bid or non-bid basis as
the Council deems fit.
   (E)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or impair their
ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment
officials shall disclose to the Mayor any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business within this jurisdiction, and they
shall further disclose to the Mayor any financial investment positions that
could be related to the performance of the city, particularly with regard to
the time of purchases and sales.

provided local institutions are price competitive with respect to rates or
return on comparable investment products.

managerial inspection, current statements of condition for each financial
institution named as depository. If, for any reason information furnished is

surplus of the depository.
(Ord. 99-O-17, passed - -99; Am. Ord. 2001-O-13, passed - -01)
§ 35.60 COLLATERALIZATION.
   (A)   It shall be city policy to require that all funds on deposit in banks
in excess of FDIC limits are secured by some form of collateral. Direct
investments guaranteed by the United States or an agency of the United States
do not require collateral.
   (B)   The city shall enter into a collateral agreement with any financial
institution in which public funds are invested or deposited. This agreement
shall be a three party agreement between the city, the bank depository and the
designated custodian of the securities. The agreement shall outline the types
of assets that may be pledged as collateral, the amount of collateral required
and the placement procedures. The governing board of the financial institution,
acting as depository, must further pass a resolution authorizing the officers
of the institution to pledge securities as required by this policy. The City
Treasurer must maintain a copy of this resolution in safekeeping and available
for inspection.
   (C)   The city shall accept any of the following securities as collateral:
      (1)   Negotiable obligations of the United States Government.

States Government.

Treasurer, but the agreement may allow for an exchange of collateral of like
value.

§ 35.61 INTERNAL CONTROLS.
   Where deemed necessary, the City Treasurer or his designee shall establish a
system of internal controls, which shall be documented in writing. These
internal controls and this investment policy shall be reviewed by an
independent, certified public accountant in conjunction with the annual
examination of the financial statements of the city. The controls shall be
designed to prevent losses of the city funds arising from fraud, employee
error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial
markets, or imprudent actions by employees.

§ 35.63 STANDARDS OF PRUDENCE.
   (A)   The standard of prudence to be used by the employees responsible for
the investment of public funds shall be the “prudent person” standard, subject
to the foregoing limitations, which state:
      Investments shall be made with judgement and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, which persons knowledgeable of investment practices, and
persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of
their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the
probable safety of their capital as well as the possible income to be derived.
   (B)   The above standard is established as the standard of professional
responsibility and shall be applied in the context of managing the city
investment portfolio. This policy recognizes that there are circumstances
beyond the control of even the most prudent investor which impact the return
obtained. However, officials and other employees of the city acting in
accordance with this investment policy and written procedures as may be
established and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price
changes, provided that deviations for expectations are reported in a timely
fashion, and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

§ 51.28 MEASUREMENTS; TESTS; ANALYSES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Waste and Wastewater” published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at that control manhole. In the event that no special manhole exists as
provided for by §
51.27, the control manhole shall be considered to be at the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected, provided the Superintendent shall be permitted to take samples
within the premises of the user, including lagoons, ponds, and other places.
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the
effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of
hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will
determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but
not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour
composites of all outfalls, whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab
samples.

Superintendent of Water, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary
for the safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent of Water
will give notice to the water customer to install such an approved device
immediately. The water customer shall, at his own expense, install such an

Plumbing Code, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and all applicable
local regulations and shall have inspections and tests made of such approved
devices upon installation and as required by the Illinois Plumbing Code,

Superintendent of Water and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
      (3)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Water to cause
surveys and investigations to be made of commercial industrial and other
properties served by the public water supply to determine whether actual or
potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and

least every two years, or as often as the Superintendent of Water shall deem
necessary. Records of such surveys shall be maintained and available for review
for a period of at least five years.
      (4)   The approved cross-connection control device inspector shall have

potential contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Neither the
city, the Superintendent of Water, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to
any customer for any injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from
termination of said customer’s water supply in accordance with the terms of
this section, whether or not said termination was with or without notice.

different colored lights or colored lighted arrows successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at the place prohibits
either turn. Vehicular traffic including vehicles turning right or left, shall
yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or at an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk, and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §
70.12, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.

      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated,
or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian- control signal as provided in §
70.12 of this chapter, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall
then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)   Flashing yellow arrow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow indication may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow indication, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in § 70.012, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk that crosses the
lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic controlled by the
flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the flashing yellow
signal indication is first displayed.
   (D)   Steady red indication:
      (1)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(3)and (D)(5) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of an intersection, or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering
the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is
shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(3) and (D)(5) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to
make the movement indicated by the arrow, and, unless entering the intersection
to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked
stop line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is
no crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by the red arrow is
shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and local
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
the turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a
one-way street, after stopping as required by (D)(1) or (D)(2) of this section.
After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the
intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways. The driver shall yield the right-of-way
to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in § 70.12, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow
signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
      (5)   In municipalities with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, after
stopping as required by divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) above, the driver of a
motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to change to a
green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds
because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the
arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle’s size or weight, shall
have the right to proceed, after yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic
facing a green signal, subject to the rules application after making a stop at
a stop sign as required by § 70.06.
   (E)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, or in the absence of
the sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (F)   The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals as
applicable to vehicles.

§ 70.32 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “Walk” or

   (A)   Walk. Pedestrians facing this signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal, and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (B)   Don’t walk. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the
direction of this signal, but any pedestrian who has partly completed his
crossing on the “Walk” signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island
while the “Don’t Walk” signal is illuminated, steady, or flashing.

permitted to drive in the lane over which the arrow signal is located.
Otherwise, he shall obey all other traffic controls present and follows normal
safe driving practices.

lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify
accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present. Otherwise he
shall obey all other traffic controls, and follow normal safe driving
practices.
   (C)   Yellow X (steady). A driver facing this indication should prepare to
vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner to avoid, if
possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed.

   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in conjunction
with a traffic-control device, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic
as follows:
   (A)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (B)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the

OPERATION
§ 71.15 OPERATION GENERALLY.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to drive or operate any snowmobile in
the following ways:
      (1)   At a rate of speed too fast for conditions; the fact that the speed
of the snowmobile does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit allowed
does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed as may be necessary
to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle or object within legal
requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.
      (2)   In a careless, reckless or negligent manner.
      (3)   At any time without at least one lighted headlamp and one lighted
taillamp on the snowmobile.
      (4)   Within any nature preserve.

shall promptly remove the snowmobile from the premises.
      (8)   Within 100 feet of a dwelling between midnight and 6:00 a.m. at a

   (B)   Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an owner, lessee, or
occupant of premises owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry
or use by others for snowmobiling, or to give warning of any condition, use,
structure, or activity on such premises. This subsection does not apply where
permission to snowmobile is given for a valuable consideration other than to
the state or the municipality, or any landowner who is paid with funds from the
Snowmobile Trail Establishment Fund. In the case of land leased to the state or
a subdivision thereof, any consideration received is not valuable consideration
within the meaning of this section. Nothing in this section limits in any way
liability which otherwise exists for willful or malicious failure to guard or
warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an owner, lessee, or
occupant of premises who gives permission to another to snowmobile upon such
premises does not thereby extend any assurance that the premises are safe for
such purpose, or assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to
person or property caused by any act or omission of persons to whom the
permission to snowmobile is granted. This subsection shall not apply where
permission to snowmobile is given for a valuable consideration other than to
the state or the municipality, or any landowner who is paid with funds from the
Snowmobile Trail Establishment Fund. In the case of land leased to the state or
a subdivision thereof, any consideration received is not valuable consideration
within the meaning of this section. Nothing in this section limits in any way
liability which otherwise exists for willful or malicious failure to guard or
warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any owner, lessee, or
occupant of premises or any person or association who, with the permission of
the owner of the premises, places, maintains, or displays a sign, signal,
marking, or device to give warning of any unsafe condition on the premises for
snowmobiling shall not be liable for any personal injuries allegedly caused by
his or her acts or omissions in providing such warning unless the alleged
misconduct was willful or malicious. This division (D) shall not apply where
the owner, occupant, or lessee of the premises grants express permission for
snowmobiling in exchange for valuable consideration. However, this division (D)
will apply where such consideration is given to such owner, occupant, or lessee
by the state or the municipality.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any other law or division of this section to the
contrary, the state or municipality owes no duty of care to keep the premises
safe for entry or use by others for snowmobiling or to guard against or give
warnings of any condition, use, structure, or activity on property in which the
state or municipality has any interest.

§ 114.04 QUALIFICATIONS OF GRANTEE; GRANT OF AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Prior to granting an initial franchise hereunder, the City Council
shall conduct a public proceeding pursuant to public notice concerning a
grantee’s application for a franchise hereunder, which proceeding shall afford
all interested parties an opportunity to participate in, and comment upon, the
legal character, financial, technical and other qualifications of the grantee,
and the adequacy and feasibility of its arrangements for the construction of a
cable television system in the city. Within 30 days after the close of the
public proceeding, if the City Council finds that a proposed grantee possesses
all necessary qualifications and that its construction arrangements are
adequate and feasible, the city shall grant to grantee, the right, privilege
and franchise to construct, operate and maintain a CATV system in the streets
of the city for a period of 15 years, this time period to begin from the date
of grant, subject to the rights, obligations, conditions and restrictions as
hereinafter provided.
   (B)   A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter
shall permit constructing, operating and maintaining a cable system in the
city, including the right to erect, install, construct, repair, replace,
reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the streets
and other public property such lines, cables, fiber optics, conductors, ducts,
conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and
other property and equipment as are necessary and appropriate to the operation
of the cable system. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install
or operate a cable system in the city within any street or within any other
right-of-way within the city without a properly granted franchise awarded
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, which franchise is in full force
and effect.
   (C)   The right to use and occupy said streets for the purpose herein set
forth shall not be exclusive. The city reserves the right to grant a similar
use of said streets to any person at any time during the period of franchise.
If the city elects to grant an additional cable television franchise, in an
area where a franchise has already been granted to a cable television operator,
to any applicant that was not authorized to provide cable television service
within the city prior to the effective date of this chapter, it shall do so
only after a public hearing noticed in a newspaper of general circulation,
where all of the following have been considered:
      (1)   Whether there will be significant positive or negative impacts on
the community being served.
      (2)   Whether there will be an unreasonable adverse economic or aesthetic
impact upon public or private property within the area.
      (3)   Whether there will be an unreasonable disruption or inconvenience
to existing users, or any adverse effect on future use, of utility poles,
public easements, and the public rights-of-way.
      (4)   Whether the franchise applicant has the technical and financial
ability to perform.
      (5)   Whether there is any impact on the franchising authority’s interest
in having an additional provider of cable service.
      (6)   Whether other societal interests generally considered by
franchising authorities will be met.
      (7)   Whether the operation of an additional cable system in the
community is economically feasible.
      (8)   Such other additional matters, both procedural and substantive, as
the franchising authority may determine to be relevant. The city shall not
grant any additional franchise more favorable or less burdensome than any
franchise granted to another grantee to serve the same area.
   (D)   (1)   A franchise granted hereunder may be renewed if:
         (a)   The grantee has substantially complied with the material terms
of the existing franchise and with applicable law;
         (b)   The quality of the grantee’s service, including signal quality,
response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to
the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over
the cable system has been reasonable in light of community needs;
         (c)   The grantee has the financial, legal, and technical ability to
provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in the grantee’s
proposal; and
         (d)   The grantee’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-
related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting
such needs and interests. The city may not declare grantee’s proposal
unreasonable and deny renewal, nor may community needs be established, on the
basis of facilities, equipment, or services which another party has indicated
it is willing to provide.
      (2)   In any renewal proceeding, the grantee shall be afforded adequate
notice and the grantee and the city, or its designee, shall be afforded fair
opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence,
to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript
shall be made of any such proceedings.
      (3)   A proceeding under this division shall be completed within 12
months of its commencement, within which time the city shall issue a written
decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of
such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the grantee. Such
decision shall state the reason therefor.
      (4)   Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be based on one or more
adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in division (1),
pursuant to the record of the proceeding under division (2). The city may not
base a denial of renewal on a failure to comply with the material terms of the
franchise under division (1) or on events considered under division (1) unless
the city has provided grantee notice and the opportunity to cure as provided in
this chapter, or in any case in which city has waived its rights to object, or
the grantee has given the city written notice of a failure to cure and the city
fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice.
      (5)   The grantee is expressly reserved its rights of appeal under
federal and state law. In addition to such rights, this franchise shall remain
in effect at all times during which a renewal proceeding or appeal remains
pending.
      (6)   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions (D)(1) through (6), the
grantee may submit a proposal for the renewal of franchise, and the city may,
after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant
or deny such proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this
section have commenced). The denial of a renewal pursuant to this division
shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance
with divisions (D)(1) through (5) above.
      (7)   The city may not, upon the expiration of this franchise, or
otherwise, acquire an ownership interest in the cable system, or require a sale
of the cable system to any other person, unless the city or such other person
acquires the ownership interest at not less than fair market value for the
cable system as a going concern.
   (E)   This chapter and any franchise awarded pursuant to the terms of this
chapter shall relate to and cover the entire present territorial limits of the
city and any area hereafter annexed thereto during the term of the franchise.
The grantee agrees to and shall install and furnish CATV service to all
residents of the city, including all residents in any territory subsequently
annexed to the city and referenced in §
114.15(A)(4).
(Ord. 94-0-6, passed 9-12-94)
§ 114.05 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The grantee shall obtain required permits from the city before
commencing construction involving the opening or disturbance of any street or
public property. The city shall cooperate with the grantee and use its best
efforts in granting any permits required. The grantee shall arrange its lines,
cable and other appurtenances, on any street or public property, in such a
manner as to cause no unreasonable interference with the usual and customary
use of said street or other public property. The grantee shall not trespass on
any private property and shall obtain all required licenses, consents, or
easements before commencing construction on any private property.
   (B)   Methods of construction, installation, and maintenance of the
grantee’s cable system shall comply with the National Electrical Safety Code to
the extent that such Code is consistent with local law affecting the
construction, installation, and maintenance of electric supply and
communication lines.
   (C)   Any and all streets or other public property which are disturbed or
damaged during the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system
shall be promptly repaired by the grantee, at its expense and to a condition
reasonably comparable to its condition prior to the disturbance or damage.
   (D)   The grantee may cut or trim trees and vegetation owned or controlled
by the city and interfering with National Electrical Safety Code and other
clearance requirements.
   (E)   In the event it is necessary temporarily to move or remove any of
grantee’s wires, cables, poles, or other facilities placed pursuant to this
franchise, in order lawfully to move a large object, vehicle, building or other
structure over the streets of the city, upon 30 days’ prior notice by the city
to grantee, the grantee shall move at the expense of the person requesting the
temporary removal such of his facilities as may be required to facilitate such
movement.
   (F)   The grantee shall at all times take reasonable precautions for
preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage or injury to
the public, to employees of the grantee, and to public or private property.
   (G)   All lines, equipment, and facilities within the service area shall at
all times be kept and maintained in a safe and suitable condition and in good
order and repair. All lines shall either be buried or strung aboveground in
accordance with the provisions of division (H) hereof and in no event shall
such lines be left to permanently lay along the ground in easement or public
right-of-way areas.
   (H)   In all other cases, the grantee shall be eligible for relocation
compensation to the same extent as the city compensates any other utility
companies. It is presently agreed and understood that grantor does not
compensate utility companies at the present time for relocation expenses within
grantor’s right-of-way or easement areas.
   (I)   All future installations of cable or wires by grantee shall be buried
underground; except, however, that in areas where the utility and telephone
company, or either of them, utilize aboveground cable or wire to provide their
services, grantee may also use aboveground cable or wire to provide its
services. In all areas where both the utility and telephone companies have
removed their aboveground cable or wire, have removed their poles, and have
buried their cable or wire underground, grantee shall also within one year from
the date that the utility and telephone companies have taken the foregoing
action, be required to bury its cable or wire underground.

results of the grantee’s annual proof of performance tests conducted pursuant
to FCC standards and requirements.
   (B)   The grantee shall continue, through the term of the franchise, to
maintain FCC technical standards. Should the city find that the grantee has
failed to maintain FCC technical standards, and should the city specifically
enumerate those standards with which grantee is not in compliance, the grantee
shall make such improvements as are necessary to meet those standards.
   (C)   The grantee shall furnish any and all compliance data forwarded by
grantee to the FCC within 30) days of filing the same with the FCC.

receipts to be paid on a quarterly basis, during each year, during the 15 years
in which any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter is in effect. The
grantee shall file with the city within 45 days after January 1 of each year
during the period this franchise shall be in force, a financial statement

the city, the grantee shall file with the city in its annual report a current

gross receipts, and grantee shall pay to the city not later than 30 days
following the termination of any franchise, a like percentage of such gross

date fixed in divisions (A) and (B) above, interest on such payments shall
apply from such date at the yearly rate of 8%, plus cost of collection.
   (D)   The city shall have the right to inspect grantee’s records showing the
gross receipts from which its franchise payments are computed pursuant to
division (A) of this section. The right of audit and recomputation of any and
all amounts paid under this franchise shall be always accorded to the city
until the third anniversary of any payment, after which such payment shall be
deemed accepted as payment in full. No acceptance of any payment by the city
shall be construed as a release of or an accord or satisfaction of any claim
the city might have for further or additional sums payable under the terms of
this chapter or for any other performance or obligation of a grantee hereunder.
   (E)   Payments of compensation made by a grantee to the city pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter shall not be considered in the nature of a tax but

shall give a grantee prompt notice of the making of any claim or the

operator may file returns and pay tax liability to the city at the same time
that he is required to file his returns and pay his tax liability to the state.
   (C)   Such quarter annual and annual returns, as to form and substance,
shall be subject to the same requirements as monthly returns.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter concerning the
time within which an operator may file his return, in the case of any operator
who ceases to engage in a kind of business which makes him responsible for
filing returns under this chapter, such operator shall file a final return

discontinuing such business.
   (E)   Where the same person has more than one hotel located within the city,
such person shall file separate returns for each such hotel.
   (F)   In his return, the operator shall determine the value of any
consideration other than money received by him in connection with the renting,

such value in his return. Such determination shall be subject to review and
revision by the city in the manner hereinafter provided for the correction of
returns.
   (G)   Where the operator is a corporation, the return filed on behalf of
such corporation shall be signed by the president, vice-president, secretary or
treasurer or by the properly accredited agent of such corporation.

taxpayer to prepare and file with the City Clerk on a form prescribed by the
city within not less than 60 days after receipt of the notice an annual
information return for the tax year specified in the notice. Such annual return
to the city shall include a statement of gross receipts as shown by the
operator’s last state income tax return. If the total receipts of the business
as reported in the state income tax return do not agree with the gross receipts
reported to the city for the same period, the operator shall attach to his
annual information return a schedule showing a reconciliation of the two
amounts and the reasons for the difference. The operator’s annual information
return to the city shall also include any additional reasonable information
which the city deems would be helpful in determining the accuracy of the
monthly, quarterly or annual tax returns by such operator as hereinbefore
provided for in this section.
   (J)   If the annual information return required by this section is not filed
when and as required, the taxpayer shall be liable for a penalty equal to 1% of

tax is not filed and paid when due, the taxpayer shall be liable for a penalty
equal to 1½% per month or a fraction thereof of the delinquent tax then due
from the taxpayer until such return is filed and tax paid with the penalty to
be assessed and collected in the same manner as any other penalty provided for
in this chapter.
   (L)   The chief executive officer, proprietor, owner or highest ranking
manager shall sign the annual return to certify the accuracy of the information
contained therein. Any person who willfully signs the annual return containing
false or inaccurate information shall be guilty of perjury and punished
accordingly. The annual return form prescribed by the city shall include a
warning that the person signing the return may be liable for perjury.
   (M)   The foregoing portion of this section concerning the filing of an
annual information return shall not apply to an operator who is not required to
file an income tax return with the United States Government.
(Ord. 95-0-10, passed 9-11-95) Penalty, see §
122.99
§ 122.08 TAX COLLECTION; ENFORCEMENT.
   The corporate authorities of the city shall have all powers necessary to
enforce the collection of the tax imposed and collected by the city pursuant to
this chapter including but not limited to subpoena power and the power to
create and enforce liens. No such lien shall affect the rights of bona fide
purchasers, mortgagees, judgment creditors or other lienholders who acquire
their interests in such property prior to the time a notice of such lien is
placed on record in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Douglas County. Any
such lien placed on record shall only act as a lien upon property located
within the corporate boundaries of the city. In creating a lien pursuant to
this section, the procedures for its notice and enforcement shall be the same
as those provided for in the Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act, as now or hereafter
amended, for state tax liens, and the Recorder of Deeds with whom a notice of
such lien is filed shall treat such lien as a state tax lien for recording
purposes.

§ 130.10 VOLUNTARY ACT.

omission to perform a duty which the law imposes on the offender, and which he
is physically capable of performing.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-1)
§ 130.11 POSSESSION AS VOLUNTARY ACT.
   Possession is a voluntary act if the offender knowingly procured or received

(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-2)
§ 130.12 MENTAL STATE.
   (A)   A person is not guilty of an offense, other than an offense which
involves absolute liability, unless, with respect to each element described by
the section defining the offense, he acts while having one of the mental states
described in §§
130.13 through
130.16.
   (B)   If the section defining an offense prescribed a particular mental
state with respect to the offense as a whole, without distinguishing among the
elements thereof, the prescribed mental state applies to each such element. If
the section does not prescribe a particular mental state applicable to an
element of an offense (other than an offense which involves absolute
liability), any mental state defined in §§
130.13,
130.14, or
130.15 is applicable.
   (C)   Knowledge that certain conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of
the existence, meaning, or application of the section defining an offense, is
not an element of the offense unless the section clearly defines it as such.
(S.H.A. Ch. 38, § 4-3)
§ 130.13 INTENT.
   A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a
result or engage in conduct described by the section defining the offense, when
his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or engage in
that conduct.

Statutory reference:
   Defenses concerning capacity, see ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 §§ 6-1 through 6-4
§ 130.14 KNOWLEDGE.
   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct,
described by the section defining the offense, when he or she is consciously
aware that his or her conduct is of that nature or that those circumstances
exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the substantial
probability that the fact exists.
      (2)   The result of his or her conduct, described by the section defining
the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that that result is
practically certain to be caused by his or her conduct.
   (B)   Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed willfully,
within the meaning of a statute using the term “willfully”, unless the section
clearly requires another meaning.
   (C)   When the law provides that acting knowingly suffices to establish an
element of an offense, the element also is established is a person acts
intentionally.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-5)
§ 130.15 RECKLESSNESS.
   A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when that person consciously
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
that a result will follow, described by the section defining the offense, and
that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation. An act performed recklessly
is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a section using the term
“wantonly”, unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-6)
§ 130.16 NEGLIGENCE.
   A person is negligent, or acts negligently, when that person fails to be
aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a
result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that
failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-7)
§ 130.17 IGNORANCE OR MISTAKE.
   (A)   A person’s ignorance or mistake as to a matter of either fact or law,
except as provided in §
130.12(C), is a defense if it negatives the existence of the mental state which
the section prescribes with respect to an element of the offense.
   (B)   A person’s reasonable belief that his conduct does not constitute an
offense is a defense if:
      (1)   The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order
which is not known to him and has not been published or otherwise made
reasonably available to him, and he could not have acquired such knowledge by
the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him; or
      (2)   He acts in reliance upon a section which later is determined to be
invalid; or
      (3)   He acts in reliance upon an order or opinion of an Illinois
Appellate or Supreme Court, or a United States appellate court later overruled
or reversed;
      (4)   He acts in reliance upon an official interpretation of the section,
regulation, or order defining the offense, made by a public officer or agency
legally authorized to interpret such section.
   (C)   Although a person’s ignorance or mistake of fact or law, or reasonable
belief, described in this section is a defense to the offense charged, he may
be convicted of an included offense of which he would be guilty if the fact or
law were as he believed it to be.
   (D)   A defense based upon this section is an affirmative defense.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-8)
§ 130.18 ABSOLUTE LIABILITY.
   A person may be guilty of an offense without having, as to each element
thereof, one of the mental states described in §§
130.13 through
130.16 if the offense is not punishable by incarceration or by a fine exceeding
$1,000, or the section defining the offense clearly indicates a legislative
purpose to impose absolute liability for the conduct described.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 4-9)
PARTIES TO CRIME
§ 130.20 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONDUCT OF ANOTHER.
   A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense if the
conduct is either that of the person himself or that of another and he is
legally accountable for such conduct as provided in §
130.21, or both.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5 § 5-1) (‘69 Code, § 18-1)
§ 130.21 WHEN ACCOUNTABILITY EXISTS.
   A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:
   (A)   Having a mental state described by the statute defining the offense,
he or she causes another to perform the conduct, and the other person in fact
or by reason of legal incapacity lacks such mental state;
   (B)   The section defining the offense makes him or her so accountable; or
   (C)   Either before or during the commission of an offense, and with the
intent to promote or facilitate that commission, he or she solicits, aids,
abets, agrees, or attempts to aid, that other person in the planning or
commission of the offense.
   When two or more persons engage in a common criminal design or agreement,
any acts in the furtherance of that common design committed by one party are
considered to be the acts of all parties to the common design or agreement and
all are equally responsible for the consequences of those further acts. Mere
presence at the scene of a crime does not render a person accountable for an
offense; a person’s presence at the scene of a crime, however, may be
considered with other circumstances by the trier of fact when determining
accountability.
   A person is not so accountable, however, unless the section defining the
offense provides otherwise, if:
      (1)   He or she is a victim of the offense committed;
      (2)   The offense is so defined that his or her conduct was inevitably
incident to its commission; or
      (3)   Before the commission of the offense, he or she terminates his or
her effort to promote or facilitate that commission, and does one of the
following:
         (a)   Wholly deprives his or her prior efforts of effectiveness in
that commission,
         (b)   Gives timely warning to the proper law enforcement authorities,
or
         (c)   Otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the
offense.

   A person who is legally accountable for the conduct of another which is an
element of an offense may be convicted upon proof that the offense was
committed and that he was so accountable, although the other person claimed to
have committed the offense, has not been prosecuted or convicted, or has been
convicted of a different offense or degree of offense, or is not amenable to
justice, or has been acquitted.

   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to knowingly manufacture, distribute,
advertise or possess a look-alike substance, as hereinafter defined.
   “LOOK-ALIKE SUBSTANCE.” A substance, other than a controlled substance
which, by overall dosage unit appearance, including shape, color, size,
markings or lack thereof, taste, consistency, or any other identifying physical
characteristics of the substance would lead a reasonable person to believe that
the substance is a controlled substance; or is expressly or impliably
represented to be a controlled substance or is distributed under circumstances
which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the substance is a
controlled substance. For the purpose of determining whether the
representations made or the circumstances of the distribution would lead a
reasonable person to believe the substance to be a controlled substance under
this clause, the court or other authority may consider the following factors in
addition to any other factor that may be relevant:
      (1)   Statements made by the owner or person in control of the substance
concerning its nature, use or affects;
      (2)   Statements made to the buyer or recipient of the substance that it
may be resold for profit;
      (3)   Where the substance is packaged in a manner normally used for
illegal distribution of controlled substances;
      (4)   Whether the distribution or attempted distribution included an
exchange of or demand for money or other property as consideration, and where
the amount of the consideration was substantially greater than the reasonable
retail market value of the substance.
   This definition shall not apply to a non-controlled substance in its
finished dosage form that was initially introduced into commerce prior to the
initial introduction into commerce of a controlled substance in its finished
dosage form which it may substantially resemble. Nothing in this definition
prohibits the dispensing or distributing of non-controlled substances by
persons authorized to dispense and distribute controlled substances under this
act, provided that such action would be deemed to be carried out in good faith
if the substances involved were controlled substances. Nothing in this division
prohibits the manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, processing,
packaging, advertising or distribution of a drug or drugs by any person
registered pursuant to Section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   “ADVERTISE.” The attempt, by publication, dissemination, solicitation or
circulation, to induce directly or indirectly any person to acquire, or enter
into an obligation to acquire, any substance within the scope of this section.
   “DISTRIBUTE.” To deliver, other than administering or dispensing, a
controlled substance.
   “MANUFACTURE.” The producing, preparing, compounding, processing,
encapsulating, packaging, repackaging, labelling or relabelling of a look-alike
substance.
   (B)   This section applies to any prosecution brought under this section. It
is not a defense to a violation of this section that the defendant believed the
look-alike substance actually to be a controlled substance.
   (C)   Nothing in this section applies to:
      (1)   The manufacture, processing, packaging, distribution or sale of
non- controlled substances to licensed medical practitioners for use as
placebos in professional practice or research;
      (2)   Persons acting in the course and legitimate scope of their
employment as law enforcement officers; and
      (3)   The lawful manufacture, processing, packaging, advertising or
distribution of a drug or drugs by any person registered pursuant to Section
510 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

full developed subdivision. The outlet restrictor shall be designed according
to the following requirements:
      (1)   All subdivisions not releasing storm water into existing city storm
sewer systems shall conform to Chapter 12 of the Illinois Drainage Manual.
      (2)   All subdivisions releasing water directly, or indirectly, into an
existing city storm sewer shall conform to Chapter 12 of the Illinois Drainage
Manual except that, the release rate shall be no more than a five-year rate of
runoff for the undeveloped condition during a 100-year design storm frequency.
      (3)   An emergency overflow shall be provided and designed to safely
accommodate flows in excess of the 100-year storm event. Calculations showing
the undeveloped runoff, changes In imperviousness due to development, fully
developed runoff, volume of storage required, volume of storage provided and
design of the outlet restrictor and emergency overflow shall be prepared by a
professional engineer, licensed in Illinois, and submitted to the City Engineer
for review and approval.
   (C)   Alternate drainage systems developed by the subdivider may be

permitted to empty into any sanitary sewer. Where a public storm sewer is
reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such storm drainage
system and shall do such grading and provide such drainage structures including
lateral connections as may be required. The subdivider shall analyze the
existing storm sewer to ensure the system can adequately accommodate the flows
being generated by the subdivision and submit those calculations for approval
by the City Engineer. If the existing sewer is found to be inadequate to carry
the runoff from the subdivision, some provisions must be made to accommodate
the additional flow, such as a parallel storm sewer, additional storm water
detention, or such other provision as approved by the City Engineer. Where a
public storm water drainage system of the district in which the subdivision is
located has been prepared and officially approved, the subdivider shall install
drainage facilities as may be required in conformity with such official plats
and the flood plan provisions of the zoning code.
   (F)   If the subdivision is in an area where a public storm water system is

   (A)   Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the city's ordinances,
as amended, the Comprehensive Plan, the "Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction" the "City of Tuscola Design and Construction Standards"
and these regulations.
   (B)   Portland cement concrete pavement shall conform to the "Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction."
   (C)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction, and
location of all streets shall conform to the city official map as adopted, or
subsequent amendments thereto, and shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, and public convenience
and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land
to be served by such streets. The street pattern shall discourage through
traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The subdivider shall provide within
the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the necessary right-of-way for the
widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in conformity with the
official map as adopted.
   (D)    Insofar as is practicable, the street arrangement should provide
proper access to schools, playgrounds, transportation and other community
features. New street openings shall be generally prohibited within 600 feet of
any major intersection or crossing such as that formed by a railroad and a
highway, two or more highways, or from the head of any major bridge, grade
separation structure, or like facilities, as measured along the centerline from
the intersection or from such structure.
   (E)   The minimum design standards for the various types of streets shall be
in accordance with the City of Tuscola Design and Construction Standards. Dead-
end streets or stub streets are prohibited. However, where it is necessary to
provide circulation to underdeveloped property adjacent to the boundaries of
the proposed subdivision, a temporary cul-de-sac with a turnaround radius of
not less than 75 feet shall be provided within the subdivision and adjacent to
its limits for what would otherwise be a stub end street. More than a 500-foot
length is discouraged.
   (F)   Intersection design standards.

three-way or T-intersections should be encouraged wherever possible.
   (G)   Special street types.
      (1)   Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided,
the other half shall be platted.
      (2)   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial street, a marginal access
street shall be designed, if the subdivision design is such that residential
lots would require direct vehicular access to the arterial highway. Points of
access to the arterial street shall be spaced at a minimum of 1,320 feet. A
green space having a minimum width of 20 feet shall be provided between the
pavement of the arterial street and the pavement of the marginal access street.

common right-of-way from opposite sides shall be 150 feet.
   (H)   All streets shall be designed to meet horizontal and vertical
alignment criteria as established by the IDOT BLR Manual (current publication)
for the particular class of street being constructed. In the case of a conflict
between the BLR design criteria and these regulations, the BLR criteria shall
take precedence.
   (I)   The intersection of subdivision streets with any existing arterial or
highway shall be designed as specified by the agency having maintenance
authority.
   (J)   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas
shall be planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic
on local streets. The intersections of driveways from parking areas with
arterial or collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least
possible interference with traffic movement on the streets, and shall be
located not less than 100 feet from the intersection of an arterial or
collector street with any other street, and shall be spaced not less than 200
feet from each other. The Plan Commission may require marginal access streets
to provide maximum safety and convenience.
   (K)   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to
serve industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so
that no industrial traffic will be directed into any residential streets. The
intersection of service streets from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall not be less than 100 feet from the intersection of the arterial
or collector street with any other street. Streets shall be planned to be
extended to the boundaries of any adjoining land planned for industry, except
for severe physical conditions or if the Plan Commission finds such extension
is not in accord with the approved plan of the area.

the city affected by a ruling of the Building Inspector concerning the
interpretation of this chapter, may take an appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals. The appeal of the action complained of shall be taken by filing with

appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a circuit court on
application and on notice to the Building Inspector from whom the appeal is

would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
      (3)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the

parallel to the center lines of streets, such district boundaries shall be
construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated
on the official zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be

(Ord. 80-0-24, passed 1-12-81)
§ 156.084 ESTABLISHMENT AND INTENT.
   The following zoning districts are established for the city. These zoning
districts have been formulated for the interpretation of this chapter and to
realize the general purposes set forth in §
156.001. In addition, the specific purpose of each zoning district shall be as
stated herein.
   (A)   The T, Transitional District is intended to prevent scattered,
indiscriminate urban development, thus allowing for efficient expansion
contiguous to the existing urban area. T District application is also intended
to prevent strip development. Subdivision is not altogether prohibited in this
district, but rather, it is regulated so as to prevent urban development that
would not be serviced by public sewer and water, or that in the present or
future would cause unnecessary increases in the cost of these and other public
services. T District application is in no way intended to regulate agricultural
uses and uses that are accessory to agricultural uses, with the exception that
area and height requirements shall apply to these uses.
   (B)   The D-l, Single-Family Dwelling District is intended to provide areas
for single-family detached dwellings as specified in the applicable lot
regulations, and is primarily intended for application in areas outside of the
older residential areas that comprise the D-2 District.
   (C)   The D-2, General Dwelling District is intended to provide areas for a
variety of housing types - single-family, two-family, and multiple-family
dwellings, as specified in §
156.102. D-2 District application is initially intended for application in the
older residential areas of the city to allow continuation of the existing
housing environment and to encourage this area to be fully developed.
   (D)   The D-3, Mobile Home Dwelling District is intended to provide areas
where mobile homes can be a viable alternative to the housing types permitted
in the D-1 and D-2 Districts. The D-3 District is intended to regulate and
encourage well- designed mobile home parks in a healthful, safe, and
comfortable environment, with particular consideration for site size, open
space, and density.
   (E)   B-l Highway Business District. The design and regulations of this
district are intended to provide for certain types of commercial activities
which have some characteristics in common. In this district the customer
usually comes directly to the particular establishment by automobile, making a
separate stop for each errand. Comparison shopping activity is less than in the
Central Business District. Since there is little essential interdependence of
activities, establishments can be dispersed over considerable areas with each
establishment having its own automobile parking. Consequently, good automobile
accessibility is essential to this district.
   (F)   The B-2, General Business District is intended to provide for certain
types of commercial activities which have functional and economic relationships
to the Central Business or Highway Business Districts, or that are related in a
peripheral manner to the Central Business District. Since there is little
essential interdependence of activities, each establishment may have its own
automobile parking area. Good traffic accessibility is essential to this
district, particularly for trucks and other freight carriers.
   (G)   The B-3, Central Business District is intended to serve the central
retail marketing function for the city. A prime characteristic of this district
is its pedestrian activity. In the regulation and the future planning of this
district, the essential interdependence of activities should be given
precedence over any desire to permit automobiles to come directly to each
establishment. Offices and office buildings are compatible with the purpose of
this district as long as adequate and convenient parking can be provided for
both the offices and nearby retail merchandising activity.
   (H)   The purpose of the I-1, Light Industry District is to provide for
storage and manufacturing uses not normally creating a nuisance discernable
beyond the property lines of each establishment.
   (I)   The purpose of the I-2, Heavy Industry District is to provide areas
for those storage and manufacturing uses which are potentially hazardous, or
which have nuisance effects which are often discernable beyond the property
lines of the establishment. Consequently, the district in which these uses are
allowed is located in areas relatively remote from residential and prime retail
development.
   (J)   FP Floodplain District.
      (1)   Floodplain regulations are designed to accomplish two basic
objectives related to flood damage protection:
         (a)   To prevent new development from increasing flood damages to
others; and
         (b)   To ensure that new building will be free from flood damage. The
guideline used in urban areas is to permit the regional flood to be raised no
more than 1/10 of a foot by future development.
      (2)   The intent of the Floodplain (FP) District is to prevent harm to
people and property in those parts of the underlying districts which lie in
flood- prone areas. As such, the FP District is an overlay district, meaning,
that the regulations for the underlying Districts apply in addition to the FP
District regulations, except if a conflict exists, the FP District regulations
shall take precedence. The exact relationship between the district regulations
and special use regulations in the Floodplain District and those of the
underlying districts is clarified in §
156.117(A). Floodplains are those areas of land adjacent to bodies of water and
drainage channels which are occasionally inundated by flood waters. More and
more of this land has been built on, resulting in rising losses from flood
damage. As the floodplain is filled in and built up, the flood waters are
constricted and forced elsewhere, at a higher velocity and with greater
potential for harm to people and property. Therefore, it is the best interest
of the public to keep floodplains as close as possible to their natural
condition so that they may fulfill their prime function of floodwater storage
and passage. The regulations set forth in §
156.125 are intended to decrease the potential for future flood losses by
guiding development away from flood-prone areas and by imposing strict
standards and requirements on any development that does take place in this
district.
   (K)   R-1, Single Family Residence in golf courses. This district is
intended to provide areas for single family, detached dwelling as specified in
the applicable lot regulations, just as specified in the D-1 District; however,
in addition to and separate and apart from the regulations governing the D-
1 District, the R-1 District would also: allow public and/or private golf
course uses, together with any and all activities normally associated with and
incident thereto, including, but not necessarily limited to, retail pro shop
activities, restaurant or food and beverage dispensing, banquet hall, and golf
driving range. These activities related to the operation and maintenance of a
golf course are limited only to the golf course, and are not permitted upon any
residential lot or within any residence located thereon. Further, no special
uses will be permitted within R-1 as concerns residential housing uses.
Further, all utilities must be buried underground.
   (L)   R-2 General Dwelling District. This district is intended to provide
areas for a variety of housing types, from single family dwelling to multi-
family dwellings. The R-2 District is like the D-2 District except as follows:
no special use permits will be allowed. All utilities must be underground.
Further, zero lot line building will be permitted, as defined herein in §
156.109.

PERMITTED AND SPECIAL USES; PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY USES
§ 156.090 PERMITTED AND SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   In any zoning district, no land, building, or structure shall be used,
and no building or structure shall hereafter be erected or structurally
altered, except for:
      (1)   One or more of the uses permitted by right in that district in §
156.092.
      (2)   One or more of the special uses listed for that district in §
156.092, provided that a special use permit therefor (for each special use) has
been issued, according to the procedure specified in §§
156.035 through §
156.042.
   (B)   In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in §
156.092 such use shall be subject to the use (whether a permitted use or a
special use) to which it is most related or similar, as determined by the
Building Inspector. He may determine that such a use is either a permitted use,
a special use, or not permitted in the zoning district in which it is proposed
or located. He shall keep a written record of all such determinations, which
may be consulted in the future.

156.999
§ 156.091 PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY USES.
   (A)   The uses listed in §
156.092 are principal uses.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided, an accessory use, building, or structure
is permitted to accompany the principal use to which it is subordinate where
such principal use is either permitted or authorized by a special use permit.
   (C)   A structure or use may be erected or established as an accessory
structure or use to a permitted principal building, structure, or use, provided
that:
      (1)   It is located on the lot occupied by or intended for the principal
use or building established or existing or on an adjoining lot under the
provisions of §§
156.100 through §
156.108, or, in the case of parking, on another lot;
      (2)   It is compatible in character and extent with the principal use and
the zoning district where it is located;
      (3)   It conforms with other such regulations as apply;
      (4)   It is not prohibited;
      (5)   It shall not be erected or established prior to the establishment
or construction of the principal use or building, except as authorized by the
Building Inspector; and
      (6)   It is customarily incidental to the principal structure or use.

Exception 2: No additional lot or parcel area is required for units above or
below the ground (grade) floor, except as might be required to meet the parking
space requirements of §
156.158.
      (2)   On all corner lots, the side requirement next to the interior lot
shall be the same as an interior lot (ten feet), however, the setback from the
intersecting streets shall be 25 feet in both directions irregardless of which
street the building faces. Side yard to alley shall be a minimum of 20 feet on
corner lots. No accessory building on a corner lot shall project beyond the
front yard required on the adjacent rear lot, nor be located nearer than ten
feet to the side line of the adjacent lots.
      (3)   Where a lot is used for any of the purposes permitted in this
district and is located at the intersection of two or more streets, and where a
Dwelling District adjoins the rear of the lot, the side yard on the side of the
lot adjacent to the street shall not be less than ten feet in width, except
that the buildable width of the lot shall not be reduced to less than 20 feet.
In all other cases, a side yard is not required except on the side of a lot
adjoining a Dwelling District, in which case there shall be a side yard of not
less than ten feet.
      (4)   There shall be a minimum side yard of not less than 15 feet on both
sides of the building or buildings, but where the property is adjacent to a
Dwelling District, there shall be a side yard of not less than 25 feet on the
side nearest to the residential lots. The parking of private automobiles may be
permitted within the side yard areas, but not closer than six feet to any lot
zoned for residential use.
      (5)   A rear yard of ten feet is required from an alley, except where a
lot abuts on a Dwelling District, in which case there shall be a rear yard of
not less than 25 feet, and no storage of materials or equipment, or the parking
of automobiles shall take place within the ten feet closest to any residential
lot or lots.
      (6)   These regulations apply only to buildings and structures other than

immediately abutting on such alleys, streets, or railroad rights-of-way. Where
the centerline of a street or alley serves as a district boundary the zoning of
such street or alley, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed
to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.
(Ord. 80-0-24, passed 1-12-81)
§ 156.106 SUPPLEMENTAL YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   In addition to all yard regulations specified in §
156.102 and in other sections of this chapter, the following provisions shall
be used for interpretation and clarification.
   (A)   No space which for the purpose of a building or dwelling group has
been counted or calculated as part of a side yard, rear yard, front yard,
court, or other open space required by this chapter, may, by reason of change
in ownership or otherwise, be counted or calculated to satisfy or comply with a
yard, court, or other open space requirement of, or for any other building.
   (B)   A terrace, not including a roofed- over porch, may occupy a front yard
provided the unoccupied portion of the front yard has a depth of not less than
15 feet. A one- story bay window may project into a front yard not more than
three feet. Overhanging eaves including gutters, may project over the minimum
required side yard not more than 24 inches.
   (C)   The minimum yards or other open spaces, including lot areas per family
required by this chapter for each and every building existing at the time of
passage of this chapter, or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be
considered as yard or open space requirements for any other building.
   (D)   On a corner lot the principal building and its accessory structures
shall be required to have the same setback distance from all street right-of-
way lines as required for the front yard in the district in which such
structures are located.
   (E)   On a corner lot in any district, nothing shall be erected, placed,
planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision
between a height of 2-½ and ten feet above the centerline grades of the
intersecting streets in the area bounded by the right-of-way lines of such
corner lots and a line joining points along the street lines 50 feet from the
point of intersection.
   (F)   In any required front yard, no fence or wall shall be permitted which
materially impedes vision across such yard above the height of 2-½ feet and no
hedge or other vegetation shall be permitted which obstructs vision across such
yard between the height of 2-½ and ten feet.
   (G)   Open structures such as porches, canopies, balconies, platforms,
covered patios, and similar architectural projections shall be considered parts
of the building to which they are attached, and shall not project into the
required minimum front, side, or rear yard. Projections shall be subject to a
special use permit.
   (H)   The height limitations contained in § 156.02 apply to all buildings
and structures with the exception of roof structures, the housing of elevators,
stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, or similar equipment required to operate
and maintain the building, and fire or protective walls, skylights, towers,
steeples, flagpoles, chimneys, smokestacks, radio and television aerials or
antennas, wireless mast, water tank, signs in the Highway Business District or
similar structures may be erected above the height limits of the district in
which it is located. No such structure may be erected to exceed by more than 25
feet the height limits of the district in which it is located, except that
aerials or antennas designed to aid home television and radio reception may be
erected to a height not to exceed 60 feet from the ground level provided the
aerial or antenna is attached to the building or erected in the side or rear
yard area.
   (I)   Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered to provide
dwelling units shall be located on a lot as herein defined and in no case shall
there be more than one such building on one lot unless otherwise provided in
this chapter.
   (J)   No building shall be constructed or erected on a lot, or parcel of
land, which does not abut upon a public street or permanent easement of access
to a public street, which easement shall have a minimum width of 25 feet unless
an easement of lesser width was of record prior to the adoption of this code.
   (K)   The purpose of this provision is to permit the utilization of older
recorded lots which lack adequate width, depth, or shape, as long as a
reasonable living standard can be provided and the character of the
neighborhood can be maintained. Any separate tract of land, or lot, or
subdivision with a recorded date before December 31, 1953, and which is located
in D-1 Single-family District, or D-2 General Residential District may be
utilized, subject to the provisions and requirements for said zoning districts,
with less than the setback requirements of the Table
156.102, provided the requirements for setbacks and open space are within 75%
of that required by the terms of this chapter. Further, any lot of any recorded
date, where 50% of the existing dwellings on one side of the street between
intersecting streets have setback lines established less than the requirement
of this section, ne buildings or additions need not setback more than the
average of those already established, but not less than 15 feet front and rear,
and six feet sides.
   (L)   No residential structure shall be erected on the rear of a lot or on a
lot with another dwelling, except that in a two- story garage with living
quarters upon the second floor, such quarters may be occupied by domestic
employees (and his or her family) of the family occupying the main structure.
There also may be constructed a guest house (without kitchen) or rooms for
guests within an accessory building, provided such facilities are used for the
occasional housing of guests of the occupancy by others as a housekeeping unit
(unless such facilities are used for the housing of invalids or elderly
relatives.)

structure, it shall be subject to, and must conform to all regulations of this
chapter applicable to the main structure.
   (B)   Accessory structures shall not be placed anywhere in the required
front yard setback, including the front or side yards adjacent to the abutting
street. An accessory structure may not be located nearer than six feet to any
interior lot line and not nearer than ten feet to the rear lot line or alley
right-of-way property line. Except that, any accessory structure 400 square
feet or less in total area, and ten feet or less in height, may be located not
less than three feet from any interior lot line, and not less than three feet
from any rear lot line, and not less than ten feet from any alley right-of-way

the main or principal use and no accessory structure shall be constructed,
erected, altered, remodeled, or extended prior to the establishment or
construction of the main or principal structure except those accessory uses and
structures of a temporary nature required for the establishment of the main or
principal use or for the construction of the main or principal structure.

actual construction has been diligently carried on, and provided further, that
such building shall be completed within two years from the date of passage and

STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL USES
§ 156.115 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   The Plan Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed special use in terms of the following standards
and requirements and shall find adequate evidence showing that such use at the
proposed location:
      (1)   Is in fact, a special use in §
156.092 for the zoning district in which it would be located;
      (2)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives, or with any specific provision, of the city Comprehensive Plan or
zoning code.
      (3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general character of the general vicinity and that such use
will not change the essential character of the same area;
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to the existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that persons or
agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to
provide adequately any such services;
      (6)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
      (7)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,

regulation of special uses, is provided in division (A)(3) hereof.
   (B)   All special uses, in all zoning districts, require a special use
permit which must be applied for to the Plan Commission and approved by the
City Council. The procedure for application and approval of special use permits
is set forth in §§ 156.033 through
156.042.
(Ord. 80-0-24, passed 1-12-81)

   In granting any special use permit, the Plan Commission may prescribe for
any structure so approved restrictions on height and bulk which are deemed
reasonable and which are in conformity with this chapter provided that such
restrictions shall not be more restrictive than the requirements established
for the district in which such structure is proposed to be located. Violation
of such conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under which the
special use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable under §
156.999.

SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 156.125 FP FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   The intent and purpose of the FP, Floodplain District is found in §
156.084(J).
   (A)   All uses. Refer to §
156.092 for a listing of permitted and special uses in the Floodplain District.
Those uses which are listed as permitted do not significantly obstruct flood
flows and shall be permitted in the FP District to the extent that they are not
prohibited by any other ordinance, or any other section of this chapter, and
provided that they do not adversely affect the capacity of the channel or
floodway of any stream, drainage ditch, or tributary thereof, or any other
drainage facility or system.
      (1)   Development standards and requirements for all uses. The first
floor or basement floor of any building or structure, including residences, to
be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or moved on the floodplain
shall be constructed on fill with the finished surface of these floors at or
above a point two feet above the regional flood elevation or flood profile
shown on the interim flood plain as designated by the official zoning map. The
landfill itself shall be at or above a point one foot above the regional flood
elevation for this area and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least
ten feet beyond the limits of any building or structure erected thereon.
However, no use or fill shall be constructed which will adversely affect the
capacity of any channel or floodway of any stream, drainage ditch, or tributary
thereof, or any other drainage facility or system.
      (2)   Accessory uses. Accessory uses to both permitted and special uses
shall be subject to the regulations in division (A)(1) above.
      (3)   The regional flood can be most accurately predicted by a detailed
engineering study. When such a study has not yet occurred or been completed,
this chapter's protection standard will be the regional flood according to the
best data available to the State Water Survey's Floodplain Information
Repository. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data he may
finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to the state water survey.
      (4)   For development proposals located in the designated interim
floodplain where the floodway has not yet been identified, the following rule

   (B)   Special uses. Refer to §
156.092 for a listing of special uses in the Floodplain District. These uses
may be permitted only on application to the Plan Commission and approval by the
City Council of a special use permit, as provided by §§
156.035 through
156.042. These uses are subject to the standards and requirements as provided
in the following divisions.
      (1)   All special uses in the Floodplain District.
         (a)   No structure (temporary or permanent), fill, including fill for
roads and levees, deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or
other uses, may be allowed as a special use which, acting alone or in
combination with existing or future uses, unduly affects the capability of the
floodway or unduly increases flood heights. Consideration of the effects of a
proposed use shall be based on a reasonable assumption that there will be an
equal degree of encroachment extending for a significant reach on both sides of
the stream or ditch. In addition, where a use is listed as both a special use
in the Floodplain District and a special use in the underlying T, D, B, or I
District, the provisions set forth in §§
156.115 through
156.119 shall also apply. A table which clarifies the relation between the
Floodplain District regulations and regulations in the underlying districts is
provided in §
156.117(A). Furthermore, the uses, buildings, and structures listed in
divisions (2) through (9) of this division shall comply with the standards and
requirements contained herein.
         (b)   The following floodproofing measures shall apply to all special
uses in the Floodplain District, to the extent that they are applicable to each
particular case of a special use. These floodproofing measures shall be
designed at or above a point two feet above the regional flood elevation for
the particular area, flood velocities, durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with the regional flood. The
Plan Commission shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document to
the Building Inspector, certified by a registered professional engineer that
the floodproofing measures are at a point two feet above the regional flood
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area. Required
floodproofing measures may include:
            l.   Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement or addition
of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation.
            2.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters, or
similar methods of construction.
            3.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressure.
            4.   Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of
water through walls.
            5.   Installation of pumps to lower water levels in buildings and
structures.
            6.   Construction of water and waste treatment systems so as to
prevent the entrance of flood waters.
            7.   Pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface
drainage systems, for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and
basement pressures.
            8.   Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water
pressure or floating debris.
            9.   Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm
drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and storm waters into the
buildings or structures. Gravity draining of basements may be eliminated by
mechanical devices.
            10.   Location of all electrical equipment, circuits, and installed
electrical appliances so as to be protected from inundation by the regional
flood.
            11.   Location of any structural storage facilities for chemicals,
explosives, bouyant materials, flammable liquids, or other toxic materials
which could be hazardous to public health, safety, and welfare, at a point
above the regional flood elevation, or their floodproofing, so as to prevent
flotation of storage containers, or damage to same, which could result in the
escape of toxic or dangerous materials into flood waters or the environment.
         (c)   Where existing conditions make compliance with the regulations
in division (A) of this subsection (those regulations covering all uses)
impractical, or in other special circumstances, the Building Inspector may
specify other floodproofing or building elevation measures such as those listed
above in lieu of fill, provided that the first floor of the building is at or
above a point two feet above the regional flood level for this area, and
provided that no special use permit under this section shall be issued where
the ground adjoining a building or structure designed for human habitation is
more than two feet below the regional flood elevation.
      (2)   Fill, dumping of materials or waste.
         (a)   Any fill, dumping, or similar use proposed in the Floodplain
District must be shown to have some beneficial purpose with regard to the
intent of the Floodplain District, and the amount thereof not greater than is
necessary to achieve that purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the
Building Inspector by the owner showing the uses to which the filled land will
be put and the final dimensions of the proposed fill.
         (b)   Such fill shall be protected against erosion during flooding by
rip-rap, vegetative cover, or bulkheading.
      (3)   Buildings and structures.
         (a)   Buildings and structures shall be constructed so as to have a
low flood damage potential.
         (b)   Buildings and structures shall be placed on the site so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
            l. Wherever possible, buildings and structures shall be constructed
with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of the flood flow.
            2. Wherever practicable, buildings and structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         (c)   Buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent
flotation which may result in damage to other buildings, structures, property,
or people.
         (d)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be constructed at or above a point two feet above the regional flood
elevation for this area or floodproofed to the same level in accordance with
division (B)(1)(b) hereof.
      (4)   Storage and processing of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human,
animal, or plant life is prohibited unless storage and processing of materials
are at or above a point two feet above the regional flood elevation for this
area, or floodproofed to the same level in compliance with division (B)(1)(b).
         (b)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and if firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
or if readily removable from the area within the time available after flood
warning.
      (5)   Garbage and solid waste disposal.
         (a)   No special use permits shall be issued for garbage and waste
disposal sites in the Floodplain District.
         (b)   There shall be no further encroachment on the floodplain at
existing garbage or waste disposal sites.
      (6)   Commercial, manufacturing, and industrial uses. Commercial,
manufacturing, and industrial buildings, structures, and additional works shall
be constructed on fill with no first floor or basement floor below a point two
feet above the regional flood elevation, or shall be floodproofed in accordance
with division (B)(1)(b) hereof to two feet above the regional flood elevation.
Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations.
      (7)   Utilities, railroad tracks, streets, and bridges. New public
utility facilities, railroad tracks, and bridges within the Floodplain District
shall be designed to minimize increases in flood elevations. Protection to the
regional flood elevations shall be provided where failure or interruption of
these facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety, or
where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area.
Where failure of interruption of service would not endanger life or health, a
lesser degree of protection may be provided for minor or auxiliary roads,
railroads, or utilities.
      (8)   Water and waste treatment plants or systems.
         (a)   New construction of, or additions and modifications to existing
treatment plants shall be floodproofed in accordance with the provisions of
division (B)(1)(b) hereof to a point two feet above the regional flood
elevation.
         (b)   Water or sewer systems shall be installed at elevations in
accordance with the first floor and basement floor elevations required in
division (A) hereof.
      (9)   Flood control works. Flood control works shall require a special
use permit and shall comply with applicable state statutes.
   (C)   Rules for interpretation.
      (1)   Removal of lands from the Floodplain District. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for the removal of lands from
the Floodplain District unless such lands are filled to a height of at least
two feet above the elevation of the regional flood for this area and are
contiguous for a significant distance to other lands outside of the Floodplain
District and unless such filled lands lie at a significant distance from the
channel or floodway of a stream or ditch. Removal of lands from the Floodplain
District is a zoning map change and must be done in accordance with the
procedure set forth in §§
156.065 through
156.071.
      (2)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes.
Larger floods may occur on rare occasions, or the flood height may be increased
by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
the Floodplain District will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter, or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 156.130 INTENT.
   Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, or amendments that
may later be adopted, there exist lots, uses of land, buildings, structures,
and combinations thereof which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to
permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded, or extended, or be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
zoning district, except in certain instances in which the non-conformity
relates only to set-back requirements, as described in §
156.131(H).

thereof may continue subject to the following conditions and specifications:
   (A)   A nonconforming use of land (outside a building) shall be made to
conform to the provisions of this chapter within a period of two years after
adoption of this chapter.
   (B)   Any nonconforming use of land, building, or structure which has ceased
by discontinuance or abandonment for a period of one year shall thereafter
conform to the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Any nonconforming building or structure which has been destroyed or
damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or by a public enemy to the extent of
50% or more of its replacement value shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Any nonconforming signs or billboards shall be removed in accordance
with §§
157.115 through
157.117. All billboards shall be considered nonconforming.
   (E)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion
of the lot or parcel not occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter.
   (F)   Should a nonconforming building or structure be moved for any reason
for any distance whatever, it shall there-after conform to the regulations for
the district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (G)   The use of a nonconforming structure or building may be changed only
to a use conforming to the district in which the property is located.
   (H)   No nonconforming building shall be enlarged or structurally altered
except:
      (1)   To make it a conforming building; or
      (2)   In the instance that the non- conformity relates only to set-back
requirements and like non-conformities commonly exist elsewhere within the same
block or neighborhood, but in all instances, the enlargement or structural
alteration shall itself be consistent with code requirements. A nonconforming
use of a building existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, or an
amendment thereto, may be extended throughout the building provided that no
structural alterations, except those required by ordinance or law, are made
therein, and provided that approval is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

§ 156.132 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in the plan, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and on which actual building construction has been
carried out diligently. Actual construction is defined to include the placing
of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried
out diligently.

   On any nonconforming building or structure, or portion of a building or
structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs,
or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing,
provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not
be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or structure or
part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
public safety, on order of such official.

§ 156.134 USES UNDER SPECIAL USE PROVISIONS.
   Any use which exists at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter
and which is a special use in the district in which it is located under the
terms of this chapter, shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall
without further action be considered a conforming use. In such cases, no
special use permit shall be required. Nothing in this section shall, however,
preclude the possibility that, although the use may be considered conforming,
the building, structure, or lot where the use is located is still
nonconforming.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 PURPOSE.
   The chapter creates the legal framework for signage regulations that is
intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable communication between people. It
recognizes the need to protect the safety and welfare of the public, the need
for well maintained and attractive appearance in a community, and the need for
adequate business identification and advertising and communication. This
chapter recognizes that aesthetics and design quality cannot be satisfactorily
legislated, as individual opinions vary and general public opinions vary from
one era to another. It is recognized, however, that a great percentage of that
which is unattractive can be eliminated by sensible quality control, through
adequate maintenance and inspection and by reasonable guidelines formulated to
minimize clutter.
   (A)   This chapter completely attempts to prevent the unsightly clutter
apparent in photograph (1). See the triangulation formula in §
157.044.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2558.jpg]
 
   (B)   Tastefully proportioned and well spaced projecting signs are
permitted. See the triangulation formula in §
157.044.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2560.jpg]
 
   (C)   This chapter authorizes the use of signs visible from public rights-
of-way provided the signs are:
      (1)   Compatible with their surroundings, pursuant to the objectives of
proper design and zoning amenities;
      (2)   Allowing and promoting optimum conditions for meeting the sign
user's needs while at the same time promoting the amenable environment desired
by the general public;
      (3)   Designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in such a manner
that they do not endanger public safety or traffic safety;
      (4)   Legible, readable, and visible in the circumstances in which they
are used;
      (5)   Respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers whose
messages are displayed.
   (D)   The cluttered and overworded wall or facia sign, shown in photograph
(3) is prohibited.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2562.jpg]
 
   (E)   This chapter does not cause
patch-like effect of the sign shown in photograph (4) as is often the case when
facia or wall sign area is restricted by formula.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/82e30bf9b3e3b35113e4c4ea044f52c4377cb549/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2564.jpg]
 
   (F)   The copy area and bonusing formula given in §
157.043 substantially encourages comprehensive store front improving facia or
wall sign installations with tastefully limited lettering copy, as shown in
photograph (5).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/82e30bf9b3e3b35113e4c4ea044f52c4377cb549/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2566.jpg]
 
   (G)   Unsightly roof sign installations such as that shown in photograph (6)
are totally prohibited.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/82e30bf9b3e3b35113e4c4ea044f52c4377cb549/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2568.jpg]
 
   (H)   Architecturally harmonious signs such as that of photograph (7) are
permitted in certain zones. They are in fact treated as wall signs.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/82e30bf9b3e3b35113e4c4ea044f52c4377cb549/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2570.jpg]
 
   (I)   Specif ic details of antiflashin g legislation should be carefully
studied by each individual community in consultation with dependable sign
manufacturers, as blanket prohibition has more than one disadvantage. There is
no question that certain carnival type, attention-compelling, jerky devices are
both totally outdated and undesirable in most areas. In cities in certain
areas, however, fascinating and artistic changing or rippling effects are quite
suitable and actually are enjoyed by most people.
   (J)   Unfortunately it is impractical to stipulate in a general code which
types of zoning should or should not permit such effects. For example, signs
adjacent to an elevated highway in a specific zone might, in one city, impinge
on or partially obscure a beautiful horizon, while in another more heavily
industrialized city with the same type of highway, they might be a vast
improvement and a visual relief amongst ugly factories and chimneys. One must
always recognize as well that signs as a communications device require certain
letter sizes for legibility at any given distance, and that in many cases this
necessary letter size may be accomplished with a much smaller sign background
by alternating messages. These alternations are actually accomplished by an
electrical device known as a flasher.
   (K)   The outdated and garish flashing sign shown in photograph (8) is
prohibited with the possible exception of special sign zones which may be
created for unusual or ethnic groupings.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/82e30bf9b3e3b35113e4c4ea044f52c4377cb549/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2572.jpg]
 
   (L)   It is apparent, therefore, that as the difference between irritating
and undesirable flashing devices, desirable alternating copy or even certain
artistic effects may be only the difference in speed of change, certainly is
often only the difference between clever and artistic design or something less,
it becomes obvious that each community, together with leaders in the industry,
must give the subject very careful study, considering the already existing
visual environment, density ratios, and other considerations.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/82e30bf9b3e3b35113e4c4ea044f52c4377cb549/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2574.jpg]
 
   (M)   Public service time and temperature, date, electronic message centers
are classed as changing signs and are permitted as shown in photograph (9)
above.
   (N)   When writing a uniform code, it becomes apparent that off-premise
signage (third party posters and bulletins) is one of the subjects that cannot
be specified in detail on a zone by zone basis, as a zone of any given category
may appear in cities of vastly different size and may have a greatly different
density ratio from one city to another. It is recommended that any given
community in consultation with the outdoor advertising people study that which
is presently permissible in their community and consider the use of the spacing
formula suggested in §
157.042. At the same time, carefully recognizing that the very nature of the
outdoor business requires as broad and even a coverage as possible and that the
broader and more reasonable distribution permitted, more easily will all
concerned be able to comply with spacing formula. This would avoid too heavy
saturation in any given area often caused by a prohibition of the medium in
certain zones where it should have been permitted. In most communities,
therefore, off-premise or outdoor advertising may be considered and analyzed
for all types of commercial and industrial zones, as well as certain holding
zones, although obviously not for residential zones.
   (O)   This chapter is designed to prevent a vast majority of those things
which are undesirable in commercial signage without hampering the inherent
right of business to communicate reasonably, to advertise and to reasonably
assist a potential customer to conveniently locate and identify any product,
goods, service, or facility which he may desire to use or purchase at any given
time.

** In square feet; if more than one face, the total permitted area may not
exceed twice the area permitted for one face.
   (G)   Table 1 bonus for landscaping around base of ground signs.
      (1)   For each square foot of landscape gardening installed at the base
and properly maintained, the user of a free-standing sign will be permitted one
square foot of area over that normally permitted, to a maximum increase of 50%;
or
      (2)   For each square foot of landscaped garden installed at the base and
properly maintained, the user of a free-standing sign will be permitted two
inches additional height over that normally permitted, to a maximum height
increase of 120 inches.
      (3)   Each square foot of landscaped garden may only be counted once,
however, the square footage may be divided to entitle the user to both bonuses
to that point where sufficient total footage may permit increases to both
maximums.
   (H)   Residential proximity. Where premises zoned for commercial or
industrial use are within 100 feet of the nearest boundary of any premises
zoned for single-family or multiple-family residential use on the same public
right-of-way, free-standing signs and roof signs erected and maintained on the
commercial or industrial premises may not exceed 25 feet in height (Table 1 if
less height is applicable) above the street grade. A free- standing sign or
roof sign must be set back from the public right-of-way from which it is
intended to be viewed the same distance as any residentially zoned property
facing the same public right-of-way within 100 feet from the sign. This
provision affects only signs on commercial and industrial premises on the same
block and on the same right-of- way as residential premises.
   (I)   Rotating signs. Rotating free-standing signs are only permissible when
a rotating sign replaces or substitutes for two other free-standing signs.
Rotating signs may not rotate at a rate of more than six revolutions per
minute. The maximum permitted area of a rotating free-standing sign shall be
equal to the area of one of the two stationary free-standing signs which it
replaces or substitutes for two other signs. (Figure 5).

   (J)   Minimum clearance. Where a free-standing sign projects over a
vehicular traffic area, such as driveway or parking lot aisle, the minimum
clearance between the bottom of the sign and the ground shall be 14 feet.
   (K)   Projection over public rights-of-way. Free-standing signs shall be
allowed to project over public street only to the same extent permitted for
projecting signs.
   (L)   Height restrictions for vehicular safety. No free-standing sign may
include any structure as a part thereof between the height of three feet and
eight feet as measured with respect to ground level.

§ 157.041 OFF-PREMISE SIGN.
   Off-premise (third party or outdoor advertising) signs may be erected on
ground or wall locations (and roof locations such as can be done within
regulations and limitations of roof signs) in industrial zones and highway
business (B-1) zones only, subject to the following conditions:
   (A)   Off-premise signs on the same street facing the same traffic flow
shall not be placed closer together than 300 feet. (Figure 6).

   (C)   At the intersection of two streets, double or single faced signs at
right angles to and, therefore, facing traffic on street A may be situated
closer than 300 feet to a similarly positioned sign across the street at right
angles to and, therefore, facing traffic on street B. (Figure 8).

   (D)   Inindustrial zones bulletins and posters shall not exceed 720 square
feet of total area. In B-1, off-premise signs shall not exceed 100 square feet
of total area.
   (E)   Structures for off-premise signs shall be vertical (cantilever)
construction and where the back is visible it shall be suitably painted or
otherwise covered to present a neat and clean appearance.
   (F)   The area around off-premise sign structures shall be kept clean and
all scrub brush or tall grass shall be cleared away to a distance of at least
five feet to the rear and sides of structure as well as to the front property
line, and if on a corner site to both property lines.
   (G)   Off-premise signs in industrial zones must be illuminated each day
from dus k to daw n.
   (H)    S ite dir ect ion al signs shall conform to all the requirements of
off-site third party signs.

   (J)   In an industrial zone, when an off-premise sign is erected between two
buildings that are within 100 feet of the structure, no part of the structure
shall be erected closer to any street line than a line drawn from the nearest
front corner of the two buildings. (Figure 10).

   (K)   No off-premise sign or free- standing sign that is freeway-oriented
shall be located other than within l,500 feet of the intersection of I-57 and
Route 36 nor shall it be more than 25 feet above the grade of the freeway or 50
feet above the grade of the site of the sign. The measurement that is higher is
to prevail as the height limit.

§ 157.042 WALL SIGNS.
   (A)   Area limits of wall signs. In all cases, all sign areas refer to the
area of copy rather than the area of the background. This has been done to
encourage advertisers to install comprehensive wall or facia signs which often
cover unsightly transom windows or other items and substantially aid in the
renovation of older buildings. Permitted background area, therefore, is the
total are a bet wee n the lin tel bar and the par ape t on a on e-story
building, or between the lintel bar and the floor level of the floor above on a
multi-storied building. Commercialism is controlled by limiting the advertising
or copy area, however, copy area is bonused for advertisers who forego any
other signage on the same premises.
      (1)   Where an advertiser has no ground, roof, or projecting sign on the
same premises, 45% of the wall sign background area may be used for copy.
(Figure 11).

      (2)   Where an advertiser has a ground sign but no roof or projecting
sign on the same premises, 30% of the wall sign background area may be used for
copy. (Figure 12).

      (3)   Where an advertiser has a projecting or roof sign but no ground
sign on the same premises, 15% of the wall sign background area may be used for
copy. (Figure 13).

   (B)   Where individual mounted letters are used without a sign background,
the foregoing percentages will apply, but will be computed on the area of the
total facade between the lintel bar and the parapet on a one-story building, or
between the lintel bar and the floor level of the floor above on a multi-
storied building.
   (C)   The frontage factor is relative to each tenant's building frontage
facing on each public right-of-way, excluding alleys and serviceways.
   (D)   Premises fronting on more than one public right-of-way may not combine
permissible signs for one frontage with another frontage for the purpose of
placing the combined area of signs on one frontage.
   (E)   Any identification wall signs with nonilluminated letters up to but
not exceeding three inches in height nor four square feet in area are not
restricted and may be permitted in addition to regulated signage.

   (A)   Roof signs on buildings which do not exceed 40 feet in height and
which are designed for viewing by traffic passing by the sign installation.

NOTE: As these sign regulations require that roof signs appear as an

allowances, therefore, include that which would have been seen as structural
support in most former sign regulations.

therefore, include that which would have been seen as structural support in
most former sign regulations.
   (B)   Roof signs on multi-storied buildings designed to be viewed from
distant points.
      (1)   This chapter commits these signs to the same configuration as an
architectural blade or penthouse which could have occurred as part of the
building itself. Such signs, therefore, are treated as would be facia signs in
division (A) as wall signs applied to an existing penthouse. (Figure 15).

      (2)   In zones where roof signs are permitted, such signs must be
manufactured in such a way that they appear as an architectural blade or
penthouse and are finished in such a manner that the visual appearance from all
sides is such that they appear to be a part of the building itself. (Figures 15
and 17).
      (3)   All roof signs shall be installed or erected in such a manner that
there shall be no visible angle iron support structure. (Figure 16).

      (4)   All roof signs must be set back a distance of at least four feet
from all the outside walls of the building on or over which they are located.
It is the intention of this provision to provide a clear passageway around the
sign.
      (5)   Roof signs may not rotate.
      (6)   For residential proximity regulations set forth in §
157.040 (E) shall apply.
      (7)   No visible guy wires, braces, or secondary supports are to be used.

§ 157.044 PROJECTING SIGNS.
   (A)   Any one tenant with frontage on a public right-of-way is permitted to
have one projecting sign along that public street. The projecting sign may
exist instead of, but not in addition to, a free- standing sign or roof sign.
Where a premise is allowed two free-standing signs, the occupant may elect to
substitute a projecting sign for one of the free- standing signs. If a premise
has at least 300 feet of frontage along any one right-of-way the occupant may
have two projecting signs.
   (B)   Subject to absolute limits of 10 feet from the property line and two
feet back from the curb line, projection over public domain is limited to 5
inches for each linear foot of building front measured from the sign location
to the nearest side line of premises. Subject to the same maximum limits, signs
on corner properties installed at 45 degrees to the corner are permitted a 20%
increase on the formula. (Figure 18, Figure l9, Figure 20).
Example:
50 foot store front with sign installed at center point 25 x 3 inches = 75
inches projection. (Figure 18).

   (C)   No projecting sign may rise more than 6 feet above the top of a
parapet.
   (D)   Minimum clearance. Projecting signs shall have a minimum clearance of
ten feet between the bottom of the sign and the ground.
   (E)   Installation. All projecting signs shall be installed or erected in
such a manner that there shall be no visible angle iron sign support structures
above a roof, building face, or wall. (Figure 21).

   Where canopy signs are allowed such signs shall be subject to the following
conditions:
   (A)   Area of copy may be three square feet per linear foot of canopy front
and sides. Copy area or any part of copy area allowed for one facing cannot be
added to that allowed for other facings. Subject to minimum height limit of
nine feet from the sidewalk, copy may be installed above, on the face of, or
below the canopy proper, provided that where such sign is installed above or
below, copy area will be computed on the total of the sign face and the canopy
apron proper.
   (B)   No portion of a canopy sign can be closer than one foot to a vertical
line from the curb face.
   (C)   On places of public entertainment such as theaters, arenas, or meeting
halls, where one or more changeable copy signs are allowed, the copy area
allowance will be five square feet per linear foot of canopy with a maximum
total height limit of no more than five feet at any point.
   (D)   In local commercial zones, the maximum copy area of canopy signs shall
be two square feet subject to the same conditions as in division (A).
   (E)   A free-standing sign supported by a sign structure which is imbedded
in the ground and independent of a canopy for structural support, may project
above and over a canopy. This section shall not be deemed to allow a free-
standing sign to be located over, in whole or in part, the roof of a building.
A free-standing sign which projects over a canopy shall comply with all other
applic able regula tions of this chapter. (Figure 23).

reverse his decision. No variance from the requirements of this chapter shall
be granted or allowed. If the Administrator's decision is reversed, the Board
shall direct the Administrator to issue the permit in accordance with its
decision. If the Administrator fails to do so for five days from receipt of the

and requirements of this chapter would cause undue and unnecessary hardship to
the sign user because of unique or unusual conditions pertaining to the
specific building or parcel of property in question; and
      (2)   The granting of the requested variance would not be materially
detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity; and
      (3)   The unusual conditions applying to the specific property do not
apply generally to other properties in the city; and
      (4)   The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the general
objective of this chapter of moderating the size, number, and obtrusive
placement of signs and the reduction of clutter.
   (C)   Where there is insufficient evidence, in the opinion of the Board, to
support a finding of undue and unnecessary hardship under division (A) above,
but some hardship does exist, the Board may consider the requirement fulfilled
if the proposed signing is of particularly good design and in particularly good
taste, and the entire site has been or will be particularly well landscaped. In
granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the
location, character, and other features of the proposed sign as it may deem
necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter in the public
interest.

§ 160.11 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for a variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the City Council.
The City Council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it
deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety, or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that
a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of §
160.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic structures. Variances to the building protection requirements
of §
160.07 which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in "HISTORIC
STRUCTURE" in §
160.02, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§§
160.06 and
160.07 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure;
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture.
      (1)   Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided
individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as
those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and
the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed:
         (a)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures;
         (b)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM);
         (c)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures,
the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation,
wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base
flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance
with §
160.07.
         (d)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with §
160.07. All of the building's structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces;
         (e)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with §
160.07.
         (f)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in accordance with §
160.07(B);
         (g)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of §
160.06. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any
designated floodway.
         (h)   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.
(Ord. 2011-O-9, passed 5-9-11)
§ 160.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 2011-O-9, passed 5-9-11)
§ 160.13 ABROGATAION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Tuscola
City Council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program including: Ordinance 2005-O-1, adopted January 24, 2005. However, this
chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-O-9, passed 5-9-11)
§ 160.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the City Attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
City Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The city shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 nor more than $750 or each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues;
      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (B)   The City Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
      (1)   The City Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (2)   (a)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
            1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation, and
            2.   The time and place of the hearing.
         (b)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
