kind or nature shall be attributed to or be assumed, whether expressly or
implied, by a party hereto, its duly authorized agents and personnel, for
failure or refusal to render aid. Nor shall there be any liability of a party

unit without prior written consent of the parties hereto; and this agreement
shall not be assigned by MABAS without prior written consent of the parties
hereto.

unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and this agreement may
be enforced with that provision severed or modified by court order.
   (M)   Notices.  All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be

   The fiscal year is from May 1 to April 30.
§ 34.02  BORROWING MONEY; LIMITATION.
   The Council may, whenever the interests of the city require it, borrow money
on the credit of the city for corporate purposes and issue bonds therefor, in
such amounts and forms, and on such conditions as it shall prescribe, but shall
not become indebted in any manner or for any purpose to an amount, including
existing indebtedness, in the aggregate to exceed 5% on the value of the
taxable property therein, to be ascertained by the last assessment for state
and county taxes previous to the incurring of such indebtedness; and before or
at the time of incurring any indebtedness, shall provide for the collection of
a direct annual tax sufficient to pay the interest on such debt as it falls
due, and also to pay and discharge the principal thereof within 20 years after
contracting the same.
(1963 Code, § 1-16-2)  (Ord. 291, passed 7-27-1931)
§ 34.03  ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS.
   The Council shall as soon as practicable after the commencement of each
fiscal year, and within the first quarter of each fiscal year, pass an
ordinance to be termed the annual appropriation ordinance.  It shall
appropriate such sums of money as may be deemed to be necessary to defray all
necessary expenses and liabilities of the city for the current year; and in
such ordinance shall specify the objects and purposes for which such
appropriations are made, and the amount appropriated for each object or
purpose.  No further appropriations shall be made at any other time within such
fiscal year, unless the proposition to make each appropriation has been first
sanctioned by a majority of the legal votes of the city, either by a petition
signed by them, or at a general or special election called therefor.
(1963 Code, § 1-16-3)  (Ord. 291, passed 7-27-1931)

herein otherwise specially provided; and no expenditure for an improvement to
be paid for out of the general fund of the city shall exceed, in any 1 year,
the amount provided for such improvement in the annual appropriation bill;
provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the Council from
ordering, by a 2/3 vote, any improvement, the necessity of which is cause by
any casualty or accident happening after such annual appropriation is made. The
Council may, by a like vote, order the Mayor and the Finance Committee to
borrow a sufficient amount to provide for the expense necessary to be incurred
in making any improvements, the necessity for which has arisen, as is herein
mentioned, for a space of time not exceeding the close of the next fiscal year;
which sum, and the interest, shall be added to the amount authorized to be
raised in the next general tax levy, and embraced therein. Should any judgment
be obtained against the city, the Mayor and Finance Committee, under the

for, or in the name of the city, except upon the prior approval of the Council

hereof shall not be held or construed to limit in any way any requirement of
law as to the making of contracts in excess of certain amounts based upon
specifications and public advertisements for bids.

(Ord. 1565, passed 4-4-1996)
§ 35.23  SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   The city is committed to maintaining a work environment that
encourages and fosters appropriate conduct among colleagues and respect for
individual values and sensibilities. Accordingly, the city’s officers and
administration are committed to enforcing its sexual harassment policy at all
levels within the workplace and creating an environment free from
discrimination of any kind, including sexual harassment.
      (2)   Sexual harassment, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and the Illinois Department of Human Rights, and for purposes of
this policy, consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors
or other verbal or non-verbal or physical acts of a sexual or sex-based nature,
where:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
         (b)   An employment decision affecting an employee is based on that
individual’s acceptance or rejection of such conduct; or
         (c)   Such conduct interferes with an individual’s work performance or
creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
      (3)   Sexual harassment can occur between men and women, or between
members of the same gender. Such conduct is unlawful under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the
basis of race, color, sex, age, religion or national origin.
      (4)   It is unlawful to retaliate in any way against anyone who has
complained about sexual harassment or discrimination, whether that complaint
relates to harassment of or discrimination against the individual submitting
the complaint or against other individual.
      (5)   Sexual harassment affects the victim and other employees as well.
Each incident of harassment contributes to a general atmosphere in which
everyone suffers the consequences. Sexually-oriented acts or sex-based conduct
have no legitimate business purpose. Where such conducts is directed by a
supervisor (or someone in a management position) toward a subordinate, the
former will be held to a higher standard of accountability because of the
degree of control and influence he or she has or is perceived to have over the
employment conditions and benefits of the subordinate.
   (B)   Prohibited conduct.
      (1)   Prohibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms
ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or contact to physical
contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct is
offensive or harassing to others. Examples of conduct which would be considered
sexual harassment include:
         (a)   Persistent or repeated unwelcome flirting, pressure for dates,
sexual comments or touching;
         (b)   Sexually suggestive jokes, gestures or sounds directed toward
another or sexually oriented comments about another;
         (c)   Preferential treatment of an employee, or a promise of
preferential treatment to an employee, in exchange for dates or sexual conduct;
or the denial or threat of denial of employment, benefits or advancement for
refusal to consent to sexual advances;
         (d)   The open display of sexually oriented pictures or posters
offensive to others;
         (e)   Retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining
about sexually harassing conduct.
      (2)   All employees are encouraged to express displeasure at any conduct
which might be sexually harassing, to tell the individual engaging in the
conduct that it is unwelcome, to report that conduct, and to use the complaint
procedure set forth in this policy.
   (C)   Complaint procedure. While the city encourages individuals who believe
they are being harassed to firmly and promptly notify the offender that his or
her behavior is unwelcome, the city also recognized that power and status
disparities between an alleged harasser and a target may make such a
confrontation impossible. In the event that such informal, direct communication
between individuals is either ineffective or impossible, or even which such
communication has occurred, the following steps should be taken to report a
sexual harassment complaint.
      (1)   Reporting of incident. All employees are urged to report any
suspected sexual harassment by another employee to the Mayor except where that
person is the individual accused of harassment. In that case, the complaint
should be reported to the Superintendent of Public Works. If the aggrieved
employee or other complainant prefers to report the suspected harassment to
someone of the opposite gender from that of the Mayor, the complaint can be
reported to the City Clerk. The report may be made initially either orally or
in writing, but reports made orally must be reduced to writing before an
investigation can be initiated either by the complainant or by the person
taking the report.
      (2)   Investigation of complaint. When a complaint is received, the Mayor
or the individual informed pursuant to division (C)(1) above will initiate an
investigation of the suspected sexual harassment within 5 working days of
notification. If necessary, the Mayor may designate another supervisory or
management employee of the opposite sex to assist him or her or the alternate
individual in division (C)(1) above in the investigation. If the Mayor is the
subject of the investigation, the investigation will be conducted by the
Superintendent of Public Works. The investigation will include an interview
with the employee(s) who made the initial report, the person(s) towards whom
the suspected harassment was directed if such person(s) is someone other than
the complainant, and the individual(s) accused of the harassment. Any other
person who may have information regarding the alleged sexual harassment may
also be interviewed.
      (3)   Report. The Mayor or designated person responsible for
investigating the complaint shall prepare a written report within 10 working
days from notification of the suspected harassment unless extenuating
circumstances prevent him or her from doing so, in which case the report shall
be prepared as promptly as possible and the complainant shall be notified as to
the reason for the delay. The report shall include a finding that sexual
harassment occurred, sexual harassment did not occur, or there is the
inconclusive evidence as to whether sexual harassment occurred. A copy of the
report will be given to the employee(s) who made the initial report, the
employee(s) to whom the suspected harassment was directed, and the employee(s)
suspected of the harassment.
      (4)   Records/Confidentiality. Employees who report incidents of sexual
harassment are encouraged to keep written notes in order to accurately record
the offensive conduct. Every effort shall be made to keep all matters related
to the investigation and various reports confidential. In the event of a
lawsuit or a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request, however, the city
advises that records it maintains and the complainant maintains may not be
considered privileged from disclosure. Written records will be maintained for 5
years from the date of the resolution unless new circumstances dictate that the
file should be kept for a longer period of time.
      (5)   Prohibition against retaliation. In addition, the Illinois Whistle
Blower Act, ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 5 prohibits retaliation against any
employee for reporting or disclosing information that the employee has
reasonable cause to believe discloses a violation of a state or federal law,
rule or regulation.
      (6)   Internal appeals process. If either party directly involved in a
sexual harassment investigation is dissatisfied within the outcome or
resolution, that individual has the right to appeal the decision. The
dissatisfied party should submit his or her written comments in a timely manner
to the City Council.
      (7)   Further legal recourse.
         (a)   Additional legal recourse, investigative and complaint process
is available through the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR), who may be

            Telephone: (800) 669-4000
         (g)   Additionally, complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission must be filed within 300 days.
   (D)   Disciplines/sanctions.
      (1)   Disciplinary action will be taken against any employee found to
have engaged in sexual harassment of any other employee. The extent of
sanctions may depend in part upon the length and conditions of employment of
the particular employee and the nature of the offense. The city has the right
to apply any sanction or combination of sanctions, up to and including
discharge, to deal with the unreasonable conduct or discrimination.
      (2)   Where a hostile work environment has been found to exist, the city
will take all reasonable steps to eliminate the conduct creating such an
environment.
      (3)   Additionally, false or frivolous complaints refer to cases in which
the accuser is acting in bad faith and using a sexual harassment complaint to
accomplish some and other than stopping sexual harassment. False accusations of
sexual harassment can have serious effects on innocent men and women. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous charge is
a severe offense that can result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination.
   (E)   The city reserves the right to amend the policy from time to time.

   (A)   Pursuant to division 2.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code, ILCS Ch. 65,
Act 5, § 1-2.1-1 et seq., which authorizes municipalities to implement a system
of administrative adjudication, there is created a system of administrative
adjudication of charges of code violations for the City of LaSalle. The system
will authorize an administrative hearing officer to conduct adjudicatory
hearings of cases instituted by city departments.
   (B)   The city adopts division 2.1 of the Illinois municipal code, ILCS Ch.
65, Act 5, § 1-2.1-1 et seq., as it may be amended from time to time. In the
event of a conflict between said statutes and this chapter, this chapter shall
prevail.
   (C)   The adoption of this chapter does not preclude the city from using
other lawful methods to enforce the provisions of this code.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the administrative adjudication system of charges of code
violations is to provide a procedure by which charges of code violations can be
equitably and efficiently adjudicated administratively by an administrative
hearing officer.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.03  JURISDICTION.
   Those matters subject to the administrative adjudication system provided for
by this chapter are charges of violation of any regulation of the City of
LaSalle, so long as the relief sought is not a penalty of incarceration or a
total fine in excess of $50,000, excluding allowable costs. The $50,000
limitation shall not apply to those cases brought to enforce the collection of
any tax imposed and collected by the city.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.04  ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS SUPERVISOR.
   There is hereby established the Office of Administrative Hearings. That
office shall be directed by an Administrative Hearings Supervisor, who shall be
the Chief of Police, or his/her designee. The Administrative Hearings
Supervisor's function is to expedite the prosecution and/or correction of code
violations subject to the jurisdiction of the administrative adjudication
system. The Administrative Hearings Supervisor is authorized to manage the
administrative adjudication process in the manner provided for in this chapter,
which shall include reviewing the qualifications of potential administrative
hearing officers and establishing such rules and regulations, as may be
necessary for the effective operation of the administrative adjudication
system. The Chief of Police may also appoint other persons to assist with the
administrative adjudication system provided for in this chapter. The
Administrative Hearings Supervisor, or his/her designee, shall also act as the
Traffic Compliance Administrator and perform those duties required by ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 11-208.3, as amended, in regard to violations for the standing,
parking or condition of motor vehicles.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.05  QUALIFICATIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS.
   (A)   Prior to conducting administrative adjudication proceedings under this
chapter, the administrative hearing officers shall have successfully completed
a formal training program that includes the following:
      (1)   Instruction on the rules of procedure of the administrative
hearings over which the administrative hearing officers shall preside;
      (2)   Orientation to each subject area of the code violations they will
adjudicate;
      (3)   Observation of administrative hearings; and
      (4)   Participation in hypothetical cases, including ruling on evidence
and issuing final orders.
   (B)   In addition, an administrative hearing officer must be an attorney
licensed to practice law in the state of Illinois for at least three years, and
be in good standing with the attorney registration and disciplinary commission
of the supreme court of Illinois. The Mayor shall have the authority to appoint
administrative hearing officers, with the advice and consent of the City
Council, to preside over administrative hearings in the city, including,
without limitation, hearings regarding vehicle impoundments under §
71.26 of this code.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.06  SCOPE OF AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS.
   Administrative hearing officers shall preside over adjudicatory hearings.
The authority of an administrative hearing officer shall encompass all acts
necessary to conduct fair and impartial adjudicatory hearings, including, but
not limited to:
   (A)   Hearing testimony and accepting evidence that is relevant to the
existence of the code violation.
   (B)   Administering oaths and affirmations to witnesses.
   (C)   At the request of any party or on the administrative hearing officer's
own motion, issuing subpoenas for the attendance of relevant witnesses and/or
the production of relevant books, records, or other information. Subpoena
issuance shall be at the discretion of the administrative hearing officer,
where it is determined that the requested witness or document is material to
the defense of the allegations and does not constitute a needless presentation
and that the elements of the defense sought to be proved could not otherwise be
established without the production of the requested evidence.
   (D)   Preserving the record of the hearing, including all exhibits and
evidence admitted into the record at the hearing.
   (E)   Issuing a determination based upon a review of the notice of
violation, citation, other charging document (hereinafter “charging document”)
and on the evidence admitted, which determination shall be final for purposes
of judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Act. The
determination shall be in writing, shall be signed by the administrative
hearing officer, shall be designated as findings, decision, and order, and
shall include the fine, penalty or action with which the respondent must
comply.
   (F)   Upon finding a respondent liable for violating one or more charged
code provisions:
      (1)   Imposing penalties as provided by the governing penalty provision,
except, however, that in no event shall an administrative hearing officer have
authority to:
         (a)   Impose a penalty of incarceration; or
         (b)   Impose a fine in excess of $50,000, excluding allowable costs.
When applicable, each day a code provision is found to have been violated by
the respondent shall constitute a separate offense, and each separate offense
subjects the respondent to the penalty provided by the governing penalty
provision.
      (2)   Imposing, in addition to fines, administrative and/or enforcement
costs and, when applicable, imposing costs incurred by the city for effecting
compliance with code provision(s) for which a respondent has been found liable.
      (3)   Ordering, notwithstanding fines imposed or costs assessed, the
respondent to comply with code provision(s) found to have been violated, and,
if appropriate, ordering the respondent to post a compliance bond as provided
by §
37.11(B) of this chapter.
      (4)   Ordering, regardless of fines imposed or costs assessed, the
respondent to perform a term of community service.
      (5)   Ordering the forfeiture of a bond deposited pursuant to LaSalle
City Code including, but not limited to, § 71.11 et seq. and §§
37.10 through
37.12 herein.
   (G)   Adhering to the policies, procedures, and legislation set forth in
this code, except where discretion is specifically vested in the administrative
hearing officer. However, an administrative hearing officer is authorized to
waive the fine and/or costs that otherwise would be imposed upon finding a
respondent liable for one or more code violations when the administrative
hearing officer specifically finds as a matter of fact that the violation(s)
occurred under such circumstances that, as a reasonable person, would
constitute an excuse for the violation(s).
   (H)   Asking questions of the parties and witnesses, if necessary, to ensure
the clarity and completeness of the testimony and the record.
   (I)   Regulating the course of the hearing in accordance with this chapter,
the rules adopted by the Administrative Hearings Supervisor for the conduct of
administrative hearings, and other applicable law.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.07  ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS.
   (A)   All administrative hearings conducted by an administrative hearing
officer are open to the public and shall be presided over by a duly appointed
administrative hearing officer who is charged with providing the parties a full
and fair opportunity to be heard.
   (B)   The city shall not be represented by an employee or other
representative of the office of administrative hearings. However, documentary
evidence, prepared by another department of the city and submitted to the
administrative hearing officer, may be presented at the hearing by the
Administrative Hearings Supervisor, or his or her designee.
   (C)   All administrative hearings shall be conducted on the date set for
hearing. In rare instances and for good cause shown, a continuance may be
granted at the discretion of the administrative hearing officer. The purpose of
administrative hearings is to provide a prompt resolution of alleged code
violations. Accordingly, the request for, and the grant of, continuances shall
be curtailed to the extent fairness permits. Lack of preparation shall not be
grounds for a continuance. Continuances shall not be granted for more than two
months.
   (D)   The administrative hearing officer may issue subpoenas.
   (E)   The formal and technical rules of evidence may be waived in the
conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it
is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct
of their affairs.
   (F)   The administrative hearing officer shall permit persons to contest the
merits of an alleged vehicular violation subject to the administrative
adjudication procedures of this chapter without attending a hearing. Any
person, who wishes to contest a vehicular violation, may file a notarized
statement of facts specifying grounds for contesting the violation notice,
which must be filed with the office of administrative hearings, postmarked
within ten days of the issuance of the notice of violation. The request shall
be deemed filed, if postmarked by such due date. The submission of a notarized
statement of facts is a waiver of the person's right to a personal appearance
and the administrative hearing officer will make his or her decision based upon
the notarized statement of facts submitted by the person and the facts
contained in the notice of violation(s).
   (G)   No violation may be established except upon proof by a preponderance
of the evidence. However, the original or a legible copy of the charging
document, issued in accordance with the applicable provisions of this code,
shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts specified in the
document.
   (H)   The Administrative Hearings Supervisor shall determine the manner in
which the record shall be preserved. Such preservation may be made by tape
recording or other appropriate means. Recording by any means by any member of
the public is prohibited unless expressly authorized by the Administrative
Hearings Supervisor. The record of all hearings before an administrative
hearing officer shall include a copy of the findings, decision, and order of
the administrative hearing officer's final determination.
   (I)   At the conclusion of a hearing, the administrative hearing officer
shall issue his or her final determination. If the administrative hearing
officer issues a final determination of liability, he or she may impose fines,
assess costs, and make orders, all as provided by §
37.06(F) of this chapter, and as are consistent with the specific code
provision(s) found to have been violated.
   (J)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative hearing officer
shall inform the parties orally and in writing of his or her determination.
Such determination shall constitute a final determination for purposes of
judicial review and is subject to review under the Illinois Administrative
Review Act. Based on the charging document and the evidence admitted, the
administrative hearing officer may issue the following determinations: liable,
not liable, or liable upon a plea of no contest. The administrative hearing
officer also may dismiss the case with or without prejudice or grant a properly
made motion by the city voluntarily dismissing the case.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.08  PROCEDURE.
   All matters to be adjudicated by the administrative hearing officer shall be

with respect to the violation(s) alleged in the charging document and
         (b)   The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing

   (C)   The hearing shall be scheduled with reasonable promptness, provided
that for hearings scheduled in all nonemergency situations, the respondent

if requested by the respondent. For purposes of this division, “nonemergency
situation” means any situation that does not reasonably constitute a threat to
the public interest, safety or welfare.
   (D)   The respondent named in a charging document shall be given notice of
the date of the adjudicatory hearing which may appear on the face of the notice
of violation, citation, or other charging document. Notice may be given in any
of the following ways:
         (a)   By first class mail or by overnight or two-day commercial

or other charging document shall be filed with the office of administrative
hearings as soon as practicable at the place and in the manner as the
administrative hearings supervisor directs. Upon receiving the original or
legible copy of the charging document, the administrative hearings supervisor
shall select a hearing date and give respondent notice of the date, time, and

charging document sets forth the date, time, and location of the hearing and
was served on the respondent as provided in this section.
   (G)   Parties to an adjudicatory hearing may be represented by an attorney,
present witnesses, and cross examine opposing witnesses. Parties may request

authority granted in this chapter.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.09  REPRESENTATION AT HEARINGS.
   (A)   City representation. The case for the city may be presented by a city
employee, or by an attorney designated by the Mayor, but not by an employee or
other representative of the office of administrative hearings, except as
allowed by §
37.07(B) of this chapter.
   (B)   Respondent representation. The case for the respondent may be
presented by the respondent or by an attorney or agent of the respondent. An
attorney or agent appearing at an adjudicatory hearing on behalf of a
respondent shall present the administrative hearing officer with a signed
appearance form stating, on oath or affirmation, that he or she has been
authorized by the respondent to represent the respondent at the hearing.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.10  DEFAULT.
   (A)   If at the time set for hearing, the respondent, or his or her attorney
or agent of record, fails to appear, the administrative hearing officer may
enter a default judgment of liability against the respondent and impose fines
and assess costs. A copy of the order of default shall be served in any manner
permitted by this chapter and applicable to the violation. The order shall
advise the respondent of the procedure for setting aside the default judgment
and shall also apprise the respondent of the availability of an appeal of the
default judgment to the circuit court of LaSalle County. The default judgment
shall be mailed promptly to the respondent as provided by §
37.08(D) of this chapter. The default judgment constitutes a final
determination for purposes of judicial review and is subject to review under
the Illinois Administrative Review Act.
   (B)   A respondent against whom a default judgment has been entered may file
a motion with the office of administrative hearings to set aside the default
judgment and request a new hearing. A motion to set aside a default judgment
may be filed at any time if the respondent alleges lack of subject matter or
personal jurisdiction. In all other cases, the motion must be filed within 21
days of entry of the default judgment. A motion to set aside a default judgment
shall set forth the reason(s) the respondent failed to appear on the original
hearing date. The administrative hearing officer shall hear and rule on the
motion. If the administrative hearing officer grants the motion, a hearing will
be held immediately on the alleged code violation(s) set forth in the charging
document unless the respondent requests another hearing date and presents good
cause for continuing the hearing.
   (C)   If any default judgment is set aside pursuant to this section, the
administrative hearing officer shall have authority to enter an order
extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the
city as a result of the vacated default judgment.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.11  FINES; COMPLIANCE BOND.
   (A)   All fines and other payments must be made within ten calendar days.
   (B)   If the administrative hearing officer issues an order of compliance,
the administrative hearing officer may order the respondent to post either cash
or other security bond to ensure respondent’s timely compliance. Any noncash
security bond shall name the city as beneficiary and shall be in the amount
specified by the administrative hearing officer. Any bond issued as a result of
an administrative hearing officer’s order is subject to review and approval by
the Mayor. If the respondent fails to timely remedy the code violation(s) for
which a bond has been issued and the city undertakes remediation or otherwise
expends funds related to the code violation(s), the administrative hearing
officer, after giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, may
issue an order permitting the city to draw against the bond in an appropriate
amount. The administrative hearing officer shall order the bond amount, less
the reasonable costs incurred by the city, returned to the respondent upon
proof of compliance. Upon failure to achieve compliance, the administrative
hearing officer shall, upon written petition of the city, increase the assessed
fine by 10% for each day beyond the original compliance date that compliance
has not been achieved.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.12  ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.
   (A)   Any fine and any administrative, enforcement, or compliance costs
imposed by an administrative hearing officer’s order that remain unpaid after
the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures,
unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be a debt due and
owing the city and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
   (B)   After the expiration of the period for which judicial review may be
sought, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the determination
of liability of an administrative hearing officer may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. At such
time, the administrative hearings supervisor shall send a notice of final
determination of liability to respondent.
   (C)   Any fine, penalty, and/or cost remaining unpaid after the notice of
final determination of liability is sent shall constitute a debt due and owing
the city. Failure of the respondent to pay such fine or penalty within 14 days
of the notice may result in a lien against the respondent's real estate or
personal estate (and foreclosure of such a lien) or such other remedies as may
be available by law, including the denial of the issuance or renewal of
licenses or permits under the city code.
   (D)   In any case in which a respondent fails to comply with an
administrative hearing officer’s  order to correct a code violation, any
expenses incurred by the city to enforce the administrative hearing officer's
order, including, but not limited to, attorney fees, court costs and costs
related to property demolition or foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owing
the city. Prior to any expenses being fixed by an administrative hearing
officer pursuant to this subsection, the respondent shall be provided with
notice that directs the respondent to appear at a hearing before an
administrative hearing officer to determine whether the respondent has failed
to comply with the administrative hearing officer’s order. The notice shall set
the place and the time for the hearing, which shall not be less than seven days
from the date the notice is served. Notice may be served by first class mail or
by an overnight or two-day commercial delivery service and the seven-day period
shall begin to run on the date that the notice was personally served, deposited
in the mail or placed with the overnight or commercial delivery service.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from enforcing or
seeking to enforce any order of an administrative hearing officer in any manner
provided by law.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)
§ 37.13  ELECTION OF REMEDIES.
   (A)   In no case may an administrative hearing officer conduct an
adjudicatory hearing for an alleged code violation where the remedy is a
punishment of imprisonment.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter, however, shall preclude the city from
petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate any ordinance
violation or an ordinance violation which provides the remedy of fine,
imprisonment and/or other appropriate legal remedies available under the law
under the State of Illinois court system and/or the Federal court system as
alternative remedies or from petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to
impose the remedy of imprisonment for failure to comply with an order of an
administrative hearing officer. Additionally, nothing provided within this
chapter including the provisions below herein within §
37.14 regarding payment in lieu of appearance in regard to this administrative
adjudication system shall affect in any manner the right and ability of the
City of LaSalle to pursue processing and enforcement of ordinances in the
Circuit Court of LaSalle County system nor to prevent, with it being the intent
that the City will still be allowed an alternative remedy and also allow the
opportunity of an election in regard to pursuit of that alternative remedy to
settle and resolve such potential disputes as may call for a citation to be
filed within the Circuit Court of LaSalle County system outside of this
Administrative Adjudication process. The City is authorized and empowered to
settle and resolve such disputes with said defendant to avoid a court
appearance by and in those events paying the City the sum set forth within the
citation which will have the heading of the Circuit Court of LaSalle County as
opposed to the City of LaSalle administrative adjudication system which remains
an alternative potential charging remedy and will also still apply to any and
all previously filed cases and/or previously issued citations. In the event
that any such complaints and/or violations bearing the heading of the filing
and/or potential filing of the Circuit Court of LaSalle County are not settled
consistent with the provisions within the citation that in any of these events
the case will remain for filing or potential resolution with the Circuit Court
of LaSalle County in the event of the issuance of such citations which remain
an alternative remedy. Additionally, the resolution and settlement of any
individual dispute as provided within this section shall not affect in any
manner any other then pending and/or additionally not yet filed alleged
violations of city ordinances.
(Ord. 2685, passed 4-24-2017)

building; except where 1 building stands at the rear of another on an interior
lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear
building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the front
building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as 1
building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any responsibility
for damage caused by or resulting from any such single connection
aforementioned.
   (E)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the authorized agent, to meet
all requirements of this subchapter.
   (F)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the
city. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in the appropriate specifications of the
American Society of Testing Materials and the Water Environment Federation
Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. A building sewer permit will only be
issued and a sewer connection shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated
that the downstream sewerage facilities, including sewers, pump stations and
wastewater treatment facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately
and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load.
   (G)   Sanitary sewer services from basements and other floors below grade
shall be connected to the sanitary service using a sewer ejector pump (overhead
sewers) at no expense to the city unless the city provides a waiver and/or
variance from this requirement as provided herein. A waiver and variance from
the provisions of this division may be granted by the City Council upon request
to the City Council on application if the City Council finds that considering
the totality of the circumstances, the likelihood of a sewer backup on the
affected premises concerning which the variance and waiver is requested is
minimal considering the totality of the circumstances involved, and further
provided that the party and/or parties requesting the variance and waiver signs
an agreement and release that will run with the land that will provide amongst
other things that the City of LaSalle be released and discharged from any
potential liability in connection with not requiring the sewer ejector pump,
and that the city further be held harmless in connection with any liability in
connection therewith and subject to such other terms as the Superintendent of
Public Works and the City Attorney for the City of LaSalle may deem appropriate
in the circumstances. In the event that an application for variance and waiver
of this particular division is denied, such denial shall be appealable to the
Circuit Court of LaSalle County, and in that regard, then subject to the same
terms, covenants and provisions and standards of review as would be provided in
connection with the appeal and review of an administrative review proceeding.
Additionally, notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary,
direct connection of basement and/or floors lying below grade to a gravity
service line shall not be permitted.
   (H)   No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation
drains, areaway drains, or other source of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved by the
authorized agent for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage.
   (I)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other
applicable rules and regulations of the city, or the procedures set forth in
appropriate specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials and the
Water Environment Federation Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections
shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any
deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the
authorized agent or his representative before installation.
   (J)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
authorized agent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer.  The connection and testing shall be made under the
supervision of the authorized agent or his representative.

either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
   (D)   (1)   The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste
shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or
quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process
or equipment, will not have any adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will
not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance.
The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if in his opinion such more
severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives.
      (2)   In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator will give consideration to such factors as the
quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process
employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of
the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The
limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or
wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be exceeded
without approval of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator are as follows:
         (a)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150° Fahrenheit (60°
Celsius).
         (b)   Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradeable cutting oils, or product of mineral oil
origin.
         (c)   Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils,

concentration as may exceed limits established by the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
         (h)   Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a
“slug” as defined herein.
         (i)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
         (j)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
         (k)   Materials which exert or cause:
            1.   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or dissolved
solids (such as, but not limited to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
            2.   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye
wastes and vegetable tanning solutions; and
            3.   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements
in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
         (l)   Wastewater containing BOD5 greater than 200 mg/l or TSS in
excess of 250 mg/l unless permitted by specific written agreement with the city
provided the city has determined that no adverse effect on the city’s
wastewater treatment facilities will occur from these alternative limits. Any
written agreement with the city to discharge such BOD5 or TSS may provide for
special charges, payments or provisions for treating and testing equipment.
   (E)   (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in division (D) of this section, and which in
the judgment of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, may have a deleterious
effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise created a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may:
         (a)   Reject the wastes;
         (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
         (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         (d)   Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer changes under the provisions of
division (J) of this section.
      (2)   When considering the above alternatives, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator shall give consideration to the economic impact of
each alternative or the discharge. If the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and
installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (F)   (1)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided at the
user’s expense when, in the opinion of the authorized agent, they are necessary
for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive
amounts, as specified in division (D)(2)(c) of this section, or any flammable
wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil separators shall be constructed of
impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. The units shall be of substantial construction, watertight and
equipped with easily removable covers which when butted in place shall be gas-
tight and watertight. Suitable grease traps are aimed at the control of fats,
oils and grease (FOG) to address maintenance issues such as sanitary sewer
blockages and accumulation of FOG materials in pump station wet wells and
wastewater treatment plant unit processes. The primary targeted commercial
entities for this type of waste are restaurants, car washes, commercial laundry
facilities, etc.
      (2)   In maintaining of these interceptors the owner(s) shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the
captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of
disposal, which are subject to review by the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed
by the owner(s)’ personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
disposal firms. Where installed, all grease and oil separators shall be
maintained by the user at their expense in continuously efficient operations.
   (G)   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at his expense.
   (H)   When required by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, the owner(s)
of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable structure together with any necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such structure, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. The structure shall be installed by
the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
   (I)   The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may require a user of sewer
services to provide information needed to determine compliance with this
subchapter.  These requirements may include:
      (1)   Wastewater’s discharge peak rate and volume over a specified time
period.
      (2)   Chemical analyses of wastewaters.
      (3)   Information on raw materials, processes, and products affecting
wastewater volume and quality.
      (4)   Quantity and disposition of specific liquid, sludge, oil, solvent,
or other materials important to sewer use control.
      (5)   A plot plan of sewers of the user’s property showing sewer and
pretreatment facility location.
      (6)   Details of wastewater pretreatment facilities.
      (7)   Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials
through spills to the municipal sewer.
   (J)   Water quality standards have been adopted by the State of Illinois,
naming dissolved and suspended substances which are objectionable, and
established the quantities of each which may be discharged into the Illinois
River as a receiving stream. The city sewer system may normally be expected to
provide a considerable dilution and this may be taken into account by an
industrial or commercial user as follows:
      (1)   Any industrial or commercial sanitary sewer user may normally
expect to discharge 5 times the concentration of any substance into the
sanitary sewer which would be permitted by the water quality standards if the
said user discharged the said waste directly to the Illinois River.
      (2)   Possibly higher concentrations of some substances may be discharged
without interfering with the sewage treatment process and this will be
considered by the city, providing:
         (a)   The industrial or commercial user inaugurates and maintains a
suitable system of policing its sewage effluent quality and quantity.
         (b)   The industry shall arrange to discharge at a uniform rate any
substances included in the list of objectionable materials of the State Water
Quality Standards for the Illinois River at LaSalle.
   (K)   Any industry discharging as much as 5 times the allowable
concentration of any substance which falls into the category of an
objectionable substance in terms of the water quality standards shall
periodically sample the sewage leaving each sewer which discharges into the
city system and shall submit a monthly report to the city including sampling
data and results of analysis. The concentration of any of said substances which
can occur in a grab sample of waste taken under the “worst” circumstances at
the “worst” time shall be the concentration that governs.
   (L)   (1)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be
determined in accordance with the last edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.
      (2)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic
instantaneous grab samples.)
   (M)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the
industrial concern.
   (N)   All disposal by any person into the sewer system is unlawful except
those discharges in compliance with federal standards promulgated pursuant to
the Federal Act and more stringent state and local standards.

§ 51.09  CONTRIBUTIONS FOR CHECK VALVE INSTALLATIONS.
   (A)   The City of LaSalle does hereby authorize and allocate total sum of
$10,000 per year for the purpose of sharing costs between the city and
residents for the installation of check valves and/or ejector pumps with a 50/
50 split per residence with the city share to be not in excess of $2,000 per
residence of the annual budget of $10,000. In the event that the entire $10,000
shall not be used in an individual year, then any balance remaining at the end
of the individual year shall lapse as to the prior year's allocation with said
balance returned to the Sewer Fund, all subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, check valves and ejector pumps are
hereby defined as follows:
      (1)   A CHECK VALVE is a device which allows liquid to flow through the
device in only one direction; and
      (2)   An EJECTOR PUMP is a pump that replaces gravity during the
transportation of waste from a pumping space that is situated underneath the
remainder of the system, and a sewage ejector pump lifts waste from the
basement or lowest level up to the sewer line where it flows out to a community
sewer.
   (C)   This cost contribution in regard to "check valves" and/or "ejector
pump" installation program, hereinafter referred to as "program", shall be
administered on a first come, first serve basis to be determined within the
sole discretion of the City Council based upon recommendation from other city
officials, most pertinently including the City Engineer Building Inspector and
Superintendent of Public Works, which program shall also be administered on a
reimbursement basis meaning that the property owner will be responsible for
making the initial payment in regard to all costs and then obtaining
reimbursement, if qualified, and provided the other criteria are met, including
funds left for a given year. The criteria in regard to selection and
qualification shall additionally include the following:
      (1)   Property owner shall be required to provide proof of recent (within
the last two years) sanitary sewer back-up. Evidence in regard to meeting this
criteria may include, but will not necessarily be limited to, the following:
dated photographs, dated video, cleaning bills, records of reports to the city
in regard to reporting back-up, amongst other evidence.
      (2)   The property owner shall also have contracted with a plumber and
caused to clean and televise the property owner's sanitary sewer service from
the residence to the city sewer main to verify that the service is in
satisfactory condition. A copy of the video shall be provided to the city
through the office of the City Engineer for review. Upon the city being
provided the appropriate evidence as required under divisions (B)(1) and (2)
above, the city will cause to clean and televise the main sewer in the vicinity
of the service connection. A photo log of the connection will be provided to
the property owner upon request. In the event that it is ultimately determined
that the property owner and property qualifies and is to be a participant in
the program, then in that event the cost of this initial inspection can be
included with the cost involved in installation of the check-valve and/or
ejector pump and thus eligible for partial reimbursement in accord with the
other terms and criteria set forth herein.
      (3)   The property owner shall additionally provide to the city through
the office of the City Engineer a certified quote from a licensed plumber in
regard to the proposed work in regard to the program (i.e., check valve and/or
ejector pump) to performed within the city. In the event the City Council based
upon the recommendation of the other City Officials including the City
Engineer, Superintendent of Public Works and Building Inspector, approves the
request, the property owner shall then cause to have the work performed by the
licensed plumber and upon providing evidence of the work having been performed
and the payment by the owner to the contractor for the check valve and/or
ejector pump, which is to be reviewed by the City Engineer and Building
Inspector, that in that event, if approved, the property owner will be
reimbursed one-half of the cost with the city share again not to exceed the sum
of $2,000.
      (4)   Any property owner may be eligible for participation more than once
involving the same property; however, in no case shall the total reimbursement
for all years and all requests exceed as to that residential property, a city
contribution of $2,000.
      (5)   That additionally, no property and/or property owner shall be
eligible for participation in this program unless all payments to the city
regarding any and all fees and/or charges claimed due to the city have been
paid, satisfied and current.
      (6)   Other factors deemed appropriate within the reasonable discretion
of LaSalle City Officials.
   (D)   This section shall apply to prospective installations only with the
exception of any resident who previously made an installation that would
otherwise qualify based upon a written representation of the Mayor that in the
event that such a program were ever implemented that said resident would be
considered for inclusion.

§ 51.24  NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with divisions (E) and (F) of this section.  Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c).
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the standard, the Superintendent shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e).
   (D)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following divisions of this section. Note: See
40 C.F.R. 403.15.
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water in accordance with
this section.  Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of division (D)(2) of this section are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 C.F.R. Subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or the industrial user demonstrates that the control
system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges.  The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
   (E)   (1)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Superintendent. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the
industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in (2)(a) through (e) below.
      (2)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; and
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions.
(Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.25  STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users must comply with state pretreatment standards located at “State of
Illinois, Rules and Regulations, Title 35: Environmental Protection: Subtitle
C: Water Pollution, Chapter 1: Pollution Control Board” are hereby
incorporated; as the same may be amended from time to time by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency.
(Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.26  LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   The Superintendent is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to
40 C.F.R. 403.5(c).
   (B)   (1)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect
against pass through, sludge contamination and interference. No person shall
discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum limit

*1 - pH standard shall be extended from 5.5 to 10.0 standard units if the
manufacturing facility is engaged in the precipitation of metals in the
pretreatment process.
 
      (2)   Discharge limits for BOD and TSS shall be established in individual
wastewater discharge permits by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. For
existing users, BOD and TSS limits will be established based upon currently
allowed discharge levels. For new users or existing users with new production
capacity and discharging greater than 25,000 gpd, or where such user is deemed
a “Significant Industrial User” by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator,
concentration limits will be set at levels such that treatment efficiency and
capacity at the POTW will not be diminished beyond the extent desired. Limits
will be established that are economically achievable where possible.
      (3)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
total metal unless indicated otherwise. The Superintendent may impose mass
limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations above.
   (C)   The Superintendent may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local
limits and the requirements of §
51.23.
(Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.27  CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
subchapter or the general and specific prohibitions in §
51.23.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.28  SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial
users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In
no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard
or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment
to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.15. They may also
request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the EPA. 
Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that
factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by the EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard.  An
industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must
comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 C.F.R. 403.12.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.29  DILUTION.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.  The
Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.30  PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities.  Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this subchapter and shall
achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits,
and the prohibitions set out in §
51.23 within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the
Superintendent - whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Superintendent shall be
provided, operated, or maintained at the industrial user’s expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Superintendent before construction of the facility. The review of such plans
and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable
discharge to the city under the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require
industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams
from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the industrial user’s compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. The facility
shall be equipped with a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which
shall be directed by the Superintendent. An individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall
be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the owner at his expense. Records showing quantities and dates of removal of
both grease and oil or sand shall be maintained by the owner. These records
shall be available for city, county, state and federal inspectors. Such units
shall comply with the city’s Oil and Grease Management Ordinance, as such
becomes enacted.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install, maintain and use an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/slug control plans.  The Superintendent may
require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/
slug control plan. At least once every 2 years the Superintendent shall
evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any
industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/
control slug plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following.
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals.
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
51.33(F).  Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the prohibited discharges in §
51.23.
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operation, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (D)   Tenant responsibility.  Where an owner of the property leases premises
to any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either
the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (E)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Superintendent, and at such times as are established by the
Superintendent.  Such wastes shall not violate §§
51.23 through
51.29 or any other requirements established or adopted by the city.  The
Superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require haulers of industrial waste to
obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits. The
Superintendent may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits. The Superintendent
also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of
hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this
subchapter.
      (3)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the Superintendent. The Superintendent may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The Superintendent
may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
      (4)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of the
sources of the waste, and volume and characteristics of the waste. The form
shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and
whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
      (5)   Fees for dumping septage will be established as part of the
industrial user fee system as authorized in §§
51.41 and
51.42.
   (F)   Vandalism.  No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW.  Any person
found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set
out in §§
51.37 through
51.39.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.31  INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS AND GENERAL PERMITS.
   (A)   Wastewater analysis.  When requested by the Superintendent, a user
must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater
within 15 days of the request. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a
form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this
information. Failure to complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for
terminating service to the industrial user and shall be considered a violation
of the subchapter.
   (B)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit requirement.
      (1)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
city’s POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit
or general permit from the Superintendent, except that a significant industrial
user that has filed a timely application pursuant to division (C) of this
section may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require other users, including liquid waste
haulers, to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits
as necessary to carry out the purpose of this subchapter.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual
wastewater discharge permit or a general permit shall be deemed a violation of
this subchapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the
sanctions set out in §§
51.37 through
51.39.  Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit or general permit does not
relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
federal, state or local law.
   (C)   Individual wastewater discharge and general permitting: existing
connections.  Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior
to the effective date of this subchapter and who wishes to continue such
discharges in the future, shall, within 180 days after said date, apply to the
Superintendent for an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general
permit in accordance with division (F) of this section, and shall not cause or
allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 90 days of the effective date of
this subchapter except in accordance with an individual wastewater discharge
permit or general permit issued by the Superintendent. Notwithstanding anything
else contained herein to the contrary, however, any significant industrial user
which as of the effective date of this subchapter already has a wastewater
discharge permit issued by the city, need not reapply; as said existing permits
shall remain in full force and effect, except that the same shall be hereby
modified to incorporate any new requirements and/or discharge limits set by
this subchapter.
   (D)   Individual wastewater discharge and general permitting: new
connections.  Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge
permit or general permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into
the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such
discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge permit must be filed at
least 60 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or
recommence.
   (E)   Individual wastewater discharge and general permit application
contents.
      (1)   All users required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge
permit or general permit must submit a permit application.  Users that are
eligible may request a general permit under division (F) of this section.  The
Superintendent may require users to submit all or some of the following
information as part of a permit application:
         (a)   Identifying information:

conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must:
         (a)   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
         (b)   Discharge the same types of wastes;
         (c)   Require the same effluent limitations;
         (d)   Require the same or similar monitoring; and
         (e)   In the opinion of the Superintendent, are more appropriately
controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge
permits.
      (2)   To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written
request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production
processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all
wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with §
51.33(D)(2) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor
expected to be present in the discharge, and any other information the POTW
deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor
expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit
until after the Superintendent has provided written notice to the SIU that such
a waiver request has been granted in accordance with §
51.33(D)(2).
      (3)   The Superintendent will retain a copy of the general permit,
documentation to support the POTW’s determination that a specific SIU meets the
criteria in division (F)(1)(a) to (e) of this section and applicable state
regulations, and a copy of the user’s written request for coverage for 3 years
after the expiration of the general permit. Note: see 40 C.F.R. 403.8(f)(1)
(iii)(A)(1) through (5).
      (4)   The Superintendent may not control an SIU through a general permit
where the facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment
standards or categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined
wastestream formula (§
51.24(C)) or net/gross calculations (§
51.24(D)). Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e) and 40 C.F.R. 403.15.
   (G)   Application signatories and certifications.
      (1)   All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports and
certification statements must be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the certification statement in §
51.33(N)(1).
      (2)   If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of this section must be submitted to the Superintendent prior to
or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
      (3)   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical
industrial user by the Superintendent pursuant to §
51.21 must annually submit the signed certification statement in §
51.33(N)(2).  Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.3(v)(2).
   (H)   Individual wastewater discharge and general permit decisions.  The
Superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information.  Within 30 days of the receipt of a complete permit
application, the Superintendent will determine whether or not to issue an
individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit.  If no
determination is made within this time period, the application will be deemed
denied. The Superintendent may deny any application for a wastewater discharge
permit or general permit.

final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
         (e)   Aggrieved parties requesting judicial review of the final
administrative individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit
decision must do so by filing a complaint with the Circuit Court of the
Thirteenth Judicial Circuit of the State of Illinois, LaSalle County, within 30
days of said final administrative decision.
   (D)   Permit modification.
      (1)   The Superintendent may modify an individual wastewater discharge
permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
         (a)   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
         (b)   To address significant alterations or additions to the user’s
operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of an
individual wastewater discharge permit issuance;
         (c)   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
         (d)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the city’s POTW, city personnel, or the receiving waters. (Note:  The
control authority should consider threats to the POTW’s beneficial sludge
use.);
         (e)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit;
         (f)   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required
reporting;
         (g)   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment
standards pursuant to 40 C.F.R. 403.13;
         (h)   To correct typographical or other errors in the individual
wastewater discharge permits; or
         (i)   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation
to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with division (E) of
this section.
      (2)   The filing of a request by the permittee for a wastewater discharge
permit modification does not stay any individual or a general permit wastewater
discharge permit condition.
      (3)   The Superintendent may modify a general permit for good cause,
including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
         (a)   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
         (b)   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
         (c)   To correct typographical or other errors in the individual
wastewater discharge permit; or
         (d)   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to
a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with division (E) of this
section.
   (E)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit transfer.
      (1)   Individual wastewater discharge permits or coverage under the
general permit may be transferred to new owner and/or operator only if the
permittee gives at least 30 days advance notice to the Superintendent and the
Superintendent approves the wastewater discharge permit or the general permit
coverage transfer.  The notice to the Superintendent must include a written
certification by the new owner or operator which:
         (a)   States that the new owner and/or operator have no immediate
intent to change the facility’s operation and processes;
         (b)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur;
and
         (c)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit.
      (2)   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the
individual wastewater discharge permit or coverage under the general permit
void as of the date of facility transfer.
   (F)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit revocation.
      (1)   The Superintendent may revoke an individual wastewater discharge
permit or coverage under a general permit for good cause, including, but not
limited to, the following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to notify the Superintendent of significant changes to
the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
         (b)   Failure to provide prior notification to the Superintendent of a
changed condition pursuant to §
51.33(E);
         (c)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;
         (d)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements;
         (e)   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
         (f)   Refusing to allow the Superintendent timely access to the
facility premises and records;
         (g)   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
         (h)   Failure to pay fines;
         (i)   Failure to pay sewer charges;
         (j)   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
         (k)   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
         (l)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted
facility; and
         (m)   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or the general permit or this
subchapter.
      (2)   Individual wastewater discharge permits or coverage under general
permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business
ownership. All individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits
issued to a user are void upon the issuance of a new individual wastewater
discharge permit or a general permit to that user.
   (G)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit reissuance. 
A user with an expiring individual wastewater discharge permit or general
permit shall apply for individual wastewater discharge permit reissuance by
submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with §
51.31(E), a minimum of 60 days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit.
   (H)   Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.
      (1)   If another municipality, or user located within another
municipality, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the Superintendent shall
enter into an intermunicipal agreement with the contributing municipality.
      (2)   Prior to entering into an agreement required by division (1),
above, the Superintendent shall request the following information from the
contributing municipality:
         (a)   A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged
to the POTW by the contributing municipality;
         (b)   An inventory of all users located within the contributing
municipality that are discharging to the POTW; and
         (c)   Such other information as the Superintendent may deem necessary.
      (3)   An intermunicipal agreement, as required by division (1), above,
shall contain the following conditions:
         (a)   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a sewer
use ordinance and local limits, including required baseline monitoring reports
(BMRs) which are at least as stringent as those set out in §
51.26.  The requirement shall specify that such ordinance and limits must be
revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the city’s ordinance or local
limits;
         (b)   A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a
revised user inventory on at least an annual basis;
         (c)   A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation
activities, including individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit
issuance, inspection, and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the
contributing municipality; which of these activities will be conducted by the
Superintendent; and which of these activities will be conducted jointly by the
contributing municipality and the Superintendent;
         (d)   A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide the
Superintendent with access to all information that the contributing
municipality obtains as part of its pretreatment activities;
         (e)   Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing
municipality’s wastewater at the point where it discharges to the POTW;
         (f)   Requirements for monitoring the contributing municipality’s
discharge;
         (g)   A provision ensuring the Superintendent access to the facilities
of users located within the contributing municipality’s jurisdictional
boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other duties deemed
necessary by the Superintendent; and
         (h)   A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the
terms of the intermunicipal agreement.
      (4)   Note: Where the contributing municipality has primary
responsibility for permitting, compliance monitoring, or enforcement, the
intermunicipal agreement should specify that the municipality (in which the
POTW is located) has the right to take action to enforce the terms of the
contributing municipality’s ordinance or to impose and enforce pretreatment
standards and requirements directly against dischargers in the event the
contributing jurisdiction is unable or unwilling to take such action.

§ 51.33  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports.  (Note: Users that become subject to new
or revised categorical pretreatment standards are required to comply with the
following reporting requirements even if they have been designated as non-
significant categorical industrial users.)
      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a) (4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall submit to the Superintendent a report which contains the information
listed in division (2), below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their
discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall
submit to the Superintendent, a report which contains information listed in
division (2), below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it
intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source shall
also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be
discharged.
      (2)   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
         (a)   All information required in §
51.31(E)(1)(a)1., (b), (c)1. and (f).  (Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1)-(7).)
         (b)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   The user shall provide the information required in §
51.31(E)(1)(g)1. through 4..
            2.   The user shall take a minimum of 1 representative sample to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            3.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards.  Where an alternative concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority.
            4.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
division (J) of this section.
            5.   The Superintendent may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures.
            6.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (c)   Compliance certification.  A statement, reviewed by the user’s
authorized representative as defined in §
51.21 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O & M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (d)   Compliance schedule.  If additional pretreatment and/or O & M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by
which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and O & M must be
provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out
in division (B) of this section.
         (e)   Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with division (N) of this section and
signed by an authorized representative as defined in §
51.21.
   (B)   Compliance schedule progress report.  The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by division (A)(2)(d) of this
section:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed 9 months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress
reports to the Superintendent.
   (C)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report containing the information described in §
51.31(E)(1)(f) and (g) and division (A) of this section.  For users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in §
51.24 (see 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)), this report shall contain a reasonable measure
of the user’s long term production rate. For all other users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
division (N) of this section.  All sampling will be done in conformance with
division (K) of this section.
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.  Note: All SIUs are required to submit
periodic compliance reports even if they have been designated a non-significant
categorical industrial user under the provisions of division (D)(3) of this
section.  The Superintendent may request chain-of-custody forms with monitoring
data.
      (1)   Except as specified in division (D)(3) of this section, all
significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the
Superintendent, but in no case less than twice per year (in July and January),
submit reports indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
discharge and which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Superintendent or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.  (Note: Required
streamlining rule change.)
      (2)   (The following provision may only be included if authorized under
state law. Criteria for monitoring waivers must also include any criteria
defined in applicable state law requirements.) The city may authorize an
industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego
sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the
industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors
that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and
without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user
(see 40 C.F.R. 403.12(e)(2)). This authorization is subject to the following
conditions:
         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is only effective for the effective period
of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than 5
years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can
be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See §
51.31(E)(1)(h).
         (c)   In making a presentation that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least 1 sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         (d)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
51.21, and include the certification statement in division (N)(1) of this
section, 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
         (e)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from
40 C.F.R. Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant
was used in the analysis.
         (f)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Superintendent may be
included as a condition of the user’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Superintendent for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.
         (g)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
user’s permit by the Superintendent, the industrial user must certify on each
report with the statement in division (N)(3) of this section, that there has
been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the
industrial user.
         (h)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or
is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user’s
operations, the user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements
of division (D)(1) of this section, or other more frequent monitoring
requirements imposed by the Superintendent, and notify the Superintendent.
         (i)   This provision does not supercede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standards.
      (3)   (a)   The city may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance
reports (see division (D)(1) of this section (40 C.F.R. 403.12(e)(1))) to a
requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standards or by the USEPA or IEPA, where the
industrial user’s total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the
following:
            1.   0.01% of the POTW’s design dry-weather hydraulic capacity of
the POTW, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user
discharges in batches.
            2.   0.01% of the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity of
the POTW.
            3.   0.01% of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any
pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for
which approved local limits were developed in accordance with §
51.26.
         (b)   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have
in the last 2 years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in §
51.36.  In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user
with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that, in the opinion of the Superintendent, decreasing the
reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (4)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with division (N)(1) of this section.
      (5)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure for a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. (Required streamlining rule change).
      (6)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed
in division (K) of this section and results of this monitoring shall be
included in the report. (Note: see 40 C.F.R. 403.12(g)(6)).
      (7)   Users that send electronic (digital) documents to the city to
satisfy the requirements of this section must satisfy the requirements of 40
C.F.R. Part 3 related to electronic reporting.
   (E)   Report of changed conditions.  Each user must notify the
Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user’s operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least 30 days before the change.
      (1)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
51.31(E) of this section.
      (2)   The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit under §
51.32(G) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit or a general permit
under §
51.32(D) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (3)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions
until and unless the Superintendent has responded to the user’s notice.
      (4)   For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10% or greater
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed
significant.
   (F)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
      (2)   Within 5 days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial
user of any expenses, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of
any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to
this subchapter.  Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges
shall be deemed a separate violation of this subchapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board
or other prominent place, advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (1) above.  Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the
Superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge. (Note: Required streamlining rule change.)
   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users.  All users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Superintendent of the Wastewater Plant as the
Superintendent may require.
   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.  If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city
performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the city
performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this
sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user. (Note: Required streamlining rule change needed if POTW
performs sampling in lieu of the industrial users. If the city performed the
sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires
the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. See 40 C.F.R. 403.12(g)
(2).)
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste numbers, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).  If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
discharges must be submitted under division (E) of this section.  The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported under the self-monitoring requirements of divisions (A), (C) and (D)
of this section.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of
this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).  Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a 1-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Superintendent, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this subchapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (J)   Analytical requirements.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard.  If 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Superintendent or other parties approved by the EPA.
   (K)   Sample collection.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.  (Note:
The control authority is required to indicate the frequency of monitoring
necessary to assess and assure compliance by the user with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.)  Chain-of-custody forms shall be used
for all sampling work that is used to generate pretreatment program reporting. 
(Note: In the streamlining rule changes, divisions (1) and (2) below have been
deleted from 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(5) and added to 403.12(g)(3). The original
paragraphs relate to categorical industrial user monitoring reports only while
all of the following paragraphs in this section apply to all SIU monitoring.)
      (1)   Except as indicated in division (K)(2) and (3) of this section, the
user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Superintendent, the samples must
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Superintendent, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits. (Note: Required streamlining rule change. See 40 C.F.R. 403.12(g)(3)).
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in divisions (A) and (C) of this section (40 C.F.R.
403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of 4 grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the Superintendent may authorize
a lower minimum. For the reports required by division (D) of this section (40
C.F.R. 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by the
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (Note: Required
streamlining rule changes, see 40 C.F.R. 403.12(g)(4).) The Superintendent may
use grab sample to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
   (L)   Date of receipt of reports.  Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (M)   Recordkeeping.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
subchapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this subchapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established under §
51.26(C).  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least 3 years. Records related to sludge
generation and disposal shall be kept for 5 years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Superintendent. (Note: The recordkeeping requirements
for BMPs are a required streamlining rule change.)
   (N)   Certification statements.  (Note: 40 C.F.R. 403.12(1) requires that
the certification that follows be provided for IU Baseline Monitoring Reports
(BMRs)(403.12(d), CIU Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance (403.12(e)) and
the initial request from CIUs to forego monitoring for pollutants not present. 
In addition to CIUs, the model ordinance requires this certification statement
for all wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports. Furthermore,
the POTW should require this certification statement for all noncategorical SIU
compliance reports.)
      (1)   Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial
monitoring waiver.
         (a)   The following certification statement is required to be signed
and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with §
51.31(G); users submitting baseline monitoring reports under division (A)(2)(e)
of this section (Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.12(1)); users submitting reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under division (C)
of this section (Note: See Section 40 C.F.R. 403.12(d)); users submitting
periodic compliance reports required by division (D) of this section (Note: See
40 C.F.R. 403.12(e) and (h)), and users submitting an initial request to forego
sampling of a pollutant on the basis of division (D)(1) through (4) of this
section (Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.12(e)92)(iii)). The following certification
statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in §
51.21:
            “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
         (b)   Additional certification concerning the use and disposal of
total toxic organic compounds shall be included with routine data submittals
and shall include the following certification statement:
            “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for total toxic organics
(TTO), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no dumping of
concentrated toxic organics into the wastewater has occurred since filing the
last discharge monitoring report. I further certify that this facility is
implementing the solvent management plan submitted to the control authority.”
      (2)   Annual certification for non-significant categorical industrial
users.  A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user by the Superintendent pursuant to §
51.21 and §
51.31(G)(3) (Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.3(v)(2)) must annually submit the
following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory
requirements in §
51.21 (Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.120(1)). This certification must accompany an
alternative report required by the Superintendent):
         “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 C.F.R.
403, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the
period from             ,          to              ,          [month, days,
year]:
         (a)   The facility described as            , [facility name] met the
definition of a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User as described in §
51.21; [Note: See 40 C.F.R. 403.3(v)(2)].
         (b)   The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards
and Requirements during this reporting period; and
         (c)   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
Categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
         This certification is based on the following information.             
                                                                               
                                                               
      (3)   Certification of pollutants not present.  Users that have an
approved monitoring waiver based on division (D) of this section must certify
on each report with the following statement that there has been no increase in
the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the user. (Note: See 40
C.F.R. 403.12(e)(2)(v)).
         “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 C.F.R. 403, I certify
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the
level of            [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the

§ 51.34  COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Inspection and sampling.
      (1)   The Superintendent or his representative(s) shall have the right to
enter the premises of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this
subchapter, and any individual wastewater discharge or general permit or order
issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof.  Users shall allow the Superintendent or his
representative(s) ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
         (a)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, personnel from the city, state, and EPA will be
permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
         (b)   The city, state and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
         (c)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated periodically, as defined in an individual wastewater
discharge or general permit, to ensure their accuracy.
         (d)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
         (e)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent or his
representatives access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this
subchapter.
      (2)   If the monitoring facility is constructed in the public right-of-
way or easement, it shall be done so in an unobstructed location. The location
of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and
whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities
should be provided in accordance with the Superintendent’s requirements and all
applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities
shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as to enable the
Superintendent or his representatives to perform independent monitoring
activities.
   (B)   Search warrants.  If the Superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the Superintendent
has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this subchapter or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection program of the city designated to verify compliance with
this subchapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon
application by the City Attorney, the Circuit Court Judge of LaSalle County
shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific
location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything
may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be
served at reasonable hours by the Superintendent in the company of a uniformed
police officer of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting public
health and safety, inspections and/or sampling shall be made without the
issuance of a warrant.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.35  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, general
permits and monitoring programs, and from the Superintendent’s inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets under applicable state law.  Any such request must be asserted
at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40
C.F.R. 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.36  PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users
which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.  The term significant
noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any
other industrial user that violates divisions (C), (D) or (H) of this section)
and shall mean:
   (A)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6 month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit as defined in §§
51.23 through
51.29 for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; (Note: Required
streamlining rule change, see 40 C.F.R. 403.3(1).)
   (B)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a 6 month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit as defined in §§
51.23 through
51.29, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD5, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); (Note: Required
streamlining rule change, see 40 C.F.R. 403.3(1).)
   (C)   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement as defined by §§
51.23 through
51.29 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Superintendent determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of city personnel or the general public) or sludge
contamination such that it limits its beneficial reuse or disposal; (Note:
Required streamlining rule change, see 40 C.F.R. 403.3(1).)
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment or has resulted in the Superintendent’s
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the schedule date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or a
general permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
   (H)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the Superintendent determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.37  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation.  The city’s enforcement response plan is
based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s “Guidance for
Developing Control, Authority Enforcement Response Plan” dated September, 1989.
The same, or any updated versions of the same, shall be made a part of the
general discharge permit issued to the monitored industries that are part of
the industrial pretreatment program. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter,
an individual wastewater discharger permit or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent or his agent may serve upon said user a written notice of
violation. Within 10 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders.  The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
a consent order, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the document. Such
documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders
issued pursuant to divisions (D) and (E) of this section and shall be
judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.  The Superintendent may order any user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action,
and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) a least 14 days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the user as defined in §
51.21 and required by §
51.31(G).  Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement
action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
   (D)   Compliance orders.  When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within 5 days. If the user does
not come into compliance within this time frame, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.  When the Superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventing action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (F)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or general permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may fine
such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a
per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation. Assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service
charge and the city shall have such other collection remedies as may be
available for other service charges and fees.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of 5% of the unpaid balance and interest
shall accrue thereafter at the rate of 1% per month. A lien against the user’s
property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Superintendent shall convene a hearing on the matter within 45 days
of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment together with any interest accruing thereto shall be
returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions. 
      (1)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge
(after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s
discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in division (H) of this section are
initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent, prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under divisions (C) and (H) of this
section.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to those provisions in §
51.32(F), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or general
permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
51.23 through
51.29.
      (2)   Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) of
this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.38  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief.  When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may petition the Circuit Court of LaSalle County, within the
Thirteenth Judicial Circuit of the State of Illinois, through the City’s
Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, the general permit order, or other
requirement imposed by this subchapter on activities of the user. The
Superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/
or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct an
environmental remediation.  A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this subchapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general
permit or order hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of not more than $
1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period
of the violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provisions of
this subchapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not
more than $1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than 1 year
or both.
      (2)   A user that willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
$1,000 and/or be subject to imprisonment of 1 year. This penalty shall be in
addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under state law.
      (3)   A user that knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this subchapter,
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit or order issued
hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this subchapter shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per day or
imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive.  The remedies provided for in this subchapter
are not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response
plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take
more than 1 enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may
be taken concurrently.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.39  SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (A)   Penalties for late reports.  A penalty of $50 shall be assessed to any
user for each day that a report required by this subchapter, a permit or order
issued hereunder is late, beginning 5 days after the date the report is due,
higher penalties may also be assessed where reports are more than 30-45 days
late. Actions taken by the Superintendent to collect late reporting penalties
shall not limit the Superintendent’s authority to initiate other enforcement
actions that may include penalties for late reporting violations.
   (B)   Performance bonds.  The Superintendent may decline to reissue an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit to any user who has
failed to comply with any provisions of this subchapter, any orders, or a
previous individual wastewater discharge permit or a previous general permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum
not to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to
achieve consistent compliance.
   (C)   Liability insurance.  The Superintendent may decline to reissue an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit to any user who has
failed to comply with any provisions of this subchapter, any order, or a
previous individual wastewater discharge permit or previous general permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   (D)   Payment of outstanding fees and penalties.  The Superintendent may
decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a
general permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or
penalties incurred as a result of any provisions of this subchapter, a previous
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order
issued hereunder.
   (E)   Water supply severance.  Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this subchapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will
recommence, at the user’s expense, only after the user has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (F)   Public nuisances.  Any violation of this subchapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public
nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent or
his designee. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of
Chapter 91 of these Codified Ordinances, governing such nuisances, including
reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying
said nuisance.
   (G)   Contractor listing.  Users who have not achieved consistent compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to
receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the city.
Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city held by a user
found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or
requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the Superintendent.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.40  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (3), below, are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent or his agent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within 5 days):
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards.  A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in §
51.23(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
51.23(B)(3) through (7) and (B)(9) through (18) if it can prove that it did not
know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources would cause pass through or interference and that
either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
(Note: Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense outlined in
this section cannot apply to the specific prohibitions in §
51.23(B)(1), (2), and (8).)
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility; and
         (b)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (C)(3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   Bypass notifications:
         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least 10 days before the date of
the bypass, if possible; and
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   Bypass:
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited and the Superintendent may take enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
of this section.
         (b)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the 3 conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) of this section.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.41  SURCHARGE COSTS.
   (A)   FOG Surcharge.  In addition to the other matters set forth herein, an
additional billable surcharge cost of $0.50/# FOG/DAY, for any discharge in
excess of 100 mg/l but below an enforcement ceiling of 180 mg/l on fats, oils
and grease (FOG) per day. This surcharge shall apply to the multiplicative
product of the facility flow in millions of gallons per day, times the
concentration of FOG in excess of 100 mg/l times the conversion factor of 8.34
pounds per gallon times the above unit rate.
   (B)   Sulfate surcharge.
      (1)   The following surcharge shall be applicable to all users for
sulfate contained in their discharge. Sulfate is a pollutant, which may be
converted to sulfide by bacterial action. Once in sulfide form, bacteria
commonly found within a sanitary sewage collection system, combined with
moisture present in the sewer can result in the formation of sulfuric acid. The
presence of sulfate in high concentrations have proven to be extremely
corrosive to concrete gravity sewers, in particular. In addition, sulfate
converted by bacteria into sulfide may combine with hydrogen to form hydrogen
sulfide, which is corrosive, odorous, and presents a serious threat to human
health, especially if breathed at high concentrations (death is quite
possible). Finally, sulfate can inhibit the activated sludge and anaerobic
digestion processes. Both activated sludge treatment and anaerobic sludge
digestion are critical to the operation of the treatment plant.
         Sulfate - (Sulfate - 400 mg/l) x 30 days at $0.01
         Where:
         Sulfate   =   User monthly average sulfate discharge concentration, in
mg/l
         400      =   Surcharge value for sulfate, below the enforcement
ceiling limit of 500 mg/l, as contained in the ordinance, based upon digester
inhibition
         30      =   days in calendar month
         $0.01   =   surcharge rate for sulfate
      (2)   The sulfate discharge shall be based upon the monthly average
discharge for each user. The monthly average value shall be determined based
upon averaging the results of all samples collected and analyzed during each
calendar month. The surcharge shall only be calculated when a user’s monthly
average sulfate concentration is in excess of 400 mg/l but below an enforcement
ceiling of 500 mg/l, or other value specific to an individual permit.
   (C)   Additional surcharge parameters for BOD5 and TSS.  These can be found
in §
51.56, or its most recent modified version.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
§ 51.42  PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES.
   The City Administration may adopt reasonable charges and fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city’s pretreatment
program, which may include:
   (A)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost
of processing such application;
   (B)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including
the cost of collection and analyzing a user’s discharge, and reviewing
monitoring reports submitted by users;
   (C)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction;
   (D)   Fees for filing appeals; and
   (E)   Other fees as the city administration may deem necessary to carry out
the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters
covered by this subchapter and are separate from all other fees, fines and
penalties chargeable by the city.
(Ord. 1785, passed 12-9-2002; Am. Ord. 2158, passed 1-26-2009)
WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 51.55  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASIC USER CHARGE.  The basic assessment levied on all users of the public
sewer system.
   CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT CHARGE.  A charge levied on users to improve, extend or
reconstruct the sewage treatment works.
   DEBT SERVICE CHARGE.  The amount to be paid each billing period for payment

(Ord. 923, passed 12-12-1977; Ord. 1200, passed 4-3-1989)
§ 51.56  SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge
for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the
city shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus
replacement, applicable surcharges and local capital cost charge composed of a
debt service charge and a capital improvement charge.
      (1)   Debt service charge. The debt service charge is computed by
dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding bonds by the number of
users. Through further divisions, the monthly and/or quarterly debt service
charges can be computed.
      (2)   Capital improvement charge. The capital improvement charge is
levied on all users to provide for capital improvements, extensions or
reconstruction of the sewage treatment works. The capital improvement is
computed by apportioning the annual amount to be accrued as a cost per 100
cubic feet or as a fixed charge per month.
      (3)   Basic user charge.
         (a)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
domestic concentrations:
            1.   A 5-day, 20-degree centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
of 200 mg/l;
            2.   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
         (b)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and shall be computed as follows:
            1.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to
be treated;
            2.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories;
            3.   Proportion the estimated OM&R costs to each user class by
volume, suspended solids and BOD;
            4.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and
replacement (OM&R) costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended
solids and BOD;
            5.   Compute costs per 100 cubic feet for normal sewage strength;
            6.   Compute surcharge costs per pound per 100 cubic feet in excess
of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
      (4)   Surcharge. A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters
exceed the normal domestic concentrations of BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l).
The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/
l concentration for BOD and SS respectively. Division (F) below of this section
specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
      (5)   Review of charges. The adequacy of the wastewater service charge
shall be reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified public
accountants for the city in their annual audit report. The wastewater service
charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs
or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs.
      (6)   Notification of users. The users of wastewater treatment services
will be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and
that portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater
treatment operation, maintenance and replacement.
   (B)   Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the
lowest even increments of 100 cubic feet.
      (1)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the Public
Waterworks System, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a
type approved by the Superintendent of Public Works for the purpose of
determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
      (2)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the Superintendent of Public Works if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (3)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the Superintendent of Public Works.
   (C)   Local capital cost charge.  Debt service charge: A debt service charge
of $3.84 per month to each user of the wastewater facility of the city is
hereby established.
   (D)   User rates. User rate minimum charges, incremental user rate charges,
and sewer maintenance fees to be applied on a monthly basis are hereby amended
and provided to be as follows:
 
Rate Component      2/1/2019 - 1/31/ 2/1/2020 - 1/31/ 2/1/2021 - 1/31/2022
                    2020             2021
Minimum base fee on
first 200 cf of     $17.00           $18.00           $19.00

Sewer rate          $17.00           $18.00           $19.00
Sewer maintenance   $7.50            $7.50            $8.00
Sewer charge per
100 cr of water     $5.00            $5.25            $5.75
used
 
      (1)   All rates shown in reference to maintenance fees and incremental
user rate sewer charges as set forth herein, with the exception of the base fee
and the sewer maintenance fee, shall be in dollars per 100 cubic feet.
Additionally, the total charge for each metered user shall be the sum of (1)
the base fee, plus (2) the increment of usage of water over 200 cubic feet per
month as provided herein multiplied by its corresponding rate, plus (3) base
fee, and the sewer maintenance fee.
      (2)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charges shall be reviewed
annually periodically by the City Council and revised as deemed within the
discretion of the City Council to be appropriate order to reflect changes in
operation, maintenance costs, necessary infrastructure improvements and
advancements and/or governmental directives and or state and/or federal
directives and/or mandates, amongst other appropriate basis for revision or
rates.
      (3)   Also, any non-metered residential users of the wastewater
facilities shall pay a minimum flat rate charge per month equal to the base
charge, plus the sewer maintenance fee for each month, which will thus allow
such non-metered users a maximum of 200 cubic feet per month.
      (4)   In the event that within the sole discretion of the Superintendent
of Public Works of the city it is determined that it is reasonably estimated
that the non-metered usage of any residential user is in excess of 200 cubic
feet per  month, the Superintendent of Public Works may require such flat rate
non-metered residential user to install metering devices on the water supply
and/or sewer main ti measure the amount of service supplied.
      (5)   Additionally, for users of over 500,000 cubic feet per month, the
city reserves the right to negotiate individually with such large users with it
understood that any such negotiation shall not affect the discretion of the
city to revise rates even without agreement of any such large user.
      (6)   The city reserves the right, duty and responsibility to review and
revise the sewer rates if deemed appropriate with the discretion of the City
Council. In connection with any such review, the City Council may utilize any
appropriate resource tool including, but not limited to, sewer rate studies.
Any amendment and/or revision hereof shall be by ordinance.
   (E)   Surcharge rate. The rates of surcharges for BOD5 and SS shall be as
follows:
      Per lb. of BOD:   $.405
      Per lb. of SS:   $.154
   (F)   Computation of surcharge. The concentration of wastes used for
computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling
shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the Superintendent of
Public Works and shall be binding as a basic for surcharges.
   (G)   Computation of wastewater service charge. The wastewater service
charge shall be computed by the following formula:
      CW = CC + CD + CM + (Vu-X) CU + CS
      Where

escalate substantially, either the City or the Contractor may request
renegotiation on collection costs upon thirty (30) days written notice to the
other party. In the event of any renegotiation amongst the parties, the City
would retain and reserve the right to place up for bid garbage services as
opposed to continuing to receive service from the present Contractor. However,

with notice, in written form, of the time, date and location of the plea
hearing. The plea hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer, appointed by
the Mayor, with the advice and consent of the City Council. The owner of
record, any lessee and any lien holder of record shall appear at a plea hearing
and enter a plea of guilty of not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, or if
the owner of record, any lessee and lien holder of record fail to appear, the
case shall be disposed of at that time, with an order/default order in favor of
the city, which order/default order shall require the payment to the city of
the $250 administrative fee for Class 1 offenses, or the $500 administrative
fee for Class 2 offenses, and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow
company, and the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of
record, any lessee or lien holder of record pays to the city applicable
administrative fee and towing and storage cost to the tow company. If the owner
of record, any lessee or any lien holder of record pleads not guilty, an
evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled and held no later than 45 days after the
date of mailing the notice of hearing, unless continued by the hearing officer.
All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at
the evidentiary hearing. At any time prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the

shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly
liable to the city for an administrative fee in the amount of $250 for Class 1
offenses, or $500 for Class 2 offenses, and require the motor vehicle to
continue to be impounded until the applicable administrative fee is paid to the
city, plus applicable towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company.
The applicable administrative fee shall be a debt due to the city. If a cash
bond has been posted pursuant to §
71.23, the bond shall be applied to the administrative fee. If the owner of

(Ord. 1187, passed 9-19-1988)
§ 91.05  SUMMARY ABATEMENT BY CITY.
   (A)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Building Inspector of the city, the
maintenance or a continuance of a nuisance creates an imminent threat of
serious injury to persons or serious damage to persons or real property, or if
the nuisance can be abated summarily without or with only minor damage to the
items or premises which are creating nuisance, and/or the continuation of the
nuisance poses a substantial threat of injury to persons or property or a
substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment of life normally present in
the community, the Building Inspector shall proceed to abate such nuisance;
provided, further, that whenever the owner, occupant, agent or person in
possession, charge or control of the real or personal property which has become
a nuisance is unknown or cannot regularly be found, the Building Inspector may
proceed to abate such nuisance without notice.  Where the abatement of the
nuisance requires continuing acts by the corporate authorities beyond initial
summary abatement and any other additional emergency abatement, it shall seek
abatement of such nuisance on a permanent basis through judicial process as
soon as reasonably possible.
   (B)   When any personalty has been removed and placed in storage by the
city, as provided for herein, said personalty shall be sold by the city after
the last of 30 days.  If the proceeds of such sale are insufficient to pay the
cost of abatement, the owner shall be liable to the city for the balance of the
cost, jointly and severally, to be recoverable in a suit at law.  If the
proceeds are in excess of the cost, the balance shall be paid to said owners or
deposited in the city treasury for their use.
   (C)   The Building Inspector or his or her duly authorized representative
shall compile the cost of such work done and improvements made in abating such
nuisance and shall charge the same against the owner of the premises.  It is
hereby provided that general overhead of administrative expenses of inspection,
locating the owner, issuing a notice, reinspection and ordering such work,
together with all necessary incidents of same, shall require a charge of $100
for each lot, series of 2 or more adjacent and contiguous lots, or tracts or
parcels of acreage, and such minimum charge is hereby established and declared
to be an expense of such work and improvement.  Notwithstanding thereof, any
tabulation of recorded cost, a minimum charge of $200 shall be assessed against
each lot so improved upon the terms of this section, but such sum of $200 is
hereby expressly stated to be a minimum charge only, and shall have no
obligation when the tabulated cost of the work shall exceed such minimum
charge.
(Ord. 1187, passed 9-19-1988)
§ 91.06  COSTS OF ABATEMENT CONSTITUTE LIEN ON PROPERTY.
   The Building Inspector shall compile such cost of the work and after
charging the same against the owner of the premises, the Building Inspector
shall certify a statement of such expense and shall file the same with the
County Recorder which shall create a lien upon the property.  For any such
expenditures and interest, suit may be instituted by the City Attorney and
recovery and foreclosure had in the name of the city; and the statements so
made, as aforesaid, or a certified copy thereof, shall be prima facie evidence
of the amount expended in any such work or improvements.

(1963 Code, § 8-1-1) (Ord. passed 7-16-1912)
§ 93.051  SPECIAL ORDINANCE REQUIRED.
   Before any sidewalk shall be constructed by order of the Council, there
shall first be a special ordinance passed by the Council, which shall specify
the locality thereof and the width thereof.
(1963 Code, § 8-1-2)  (Ord. passed 7-16-1912)
§ 93.052  SIDEWALK SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks which shall hereafter be constructed unless otherwise
specially ordained, shall be constructed of concrete of the best material
according to the specifications hereinafter provided.  The specifications for
such sidewalks shall be as follows:
   (A)   Subgrade. The ground shall be excavated or filled to a depth of 12½
inches below the surface of the finished walk and the surface of the subgrade
shall be thoroughly and evenly tamped.
   (B)   Fill. Whenever filling is required it will be made of any suitable
material excavated from the work or with gravel.  All fills shall be made in
uniform layers not exceeding 6 inches in depth and each layer shall be
thoroughly tamped to insure a solid bed.
   (C)   Removal of soft material.  All soft and spongy material that cannot be
made solid shall be removed and the places filled with gravel.
   (D)   Foundation. Upon the subgrade as herein described, will be laid a
foundation course 7½ inches thick, after tamping, of good clean cinders or
gravel which shall be flooded and thoroughly tamped so as to procure a compact
solid foundation.
   (E)   Concrete. Upon this bed or foundation of cinders or gravel thus
formed, shall be placed a course of concrete 4 inches in thickness when tamped,
which concrete shall be composed of 1 part by bulk of best Portland cement, 2
parts by bulk of clean sharp sand and 4 parts by bulk of crushed stone or good
clean gravel crushed to such size that the fragments thereof shall pass through
a 2-inch ring.
   (F)   Wearing surface. Upon the concrete base there shall be spread a finish
coat or wearing surface 1 inch in thickness composed of 1 part by bulk of best
Portland cement, and 1½ parts by bulk of clean, sharp sand, finished to a
smooth surface.  This finish coat shall be spread on the concrete as soon as
the same is tamped and before it has begun to set and in such manner as shall
bind firmly to the concrete base.  It must be quickly and evenly spread and
shall then be floated and troweled to a smooth surface conforming to the grade
line.
   (G)   Mixing. The concrete shall be mixed by machinery or by hand.  If mixed
by machinery the mixing shall be done in a batch mixer subject to the approval
of the Board of Local Improvements.  If by hand, the sand and cement shall be
first mixed dry in proper proportions until the mixing shows a uniform color,
and to the mixture thus prepared shall be added the proper proportion of broken
stone or gravel which has been previously drenched with water and the whole
shall be mixed until every piece of the rock or gravel is coated with mortar. 
Sufficient water shall be used in mixing the concrete so that the water will
readily flush to the surface with very light tamping.
   (H)   Consistency of concrete. The concrete thus mixed shall have a
consistency that when rammed the mass shall not shake like jelly, but will when
struck remain compact and firm under the area of the tamper without being
displaced laterally.
   (I)   Mixing and laying.  The whole operation of mixing and laying each
batch of concrete shall be done in an expeditious and workmanlike manner, and
the concrete shall be thoroughly tamped immediately after it is placed in the
form.
   (J)   Retempering.  No retempering of concrete will be permitted and
concrete in which the mortar has begun to set will be rejected.
   (K)   Joints. The walk shall be laid off in blocks of the same length as the
width of the walks so as to make blocks practically square.  The joints shall
be cut clear through the concrete and shall be 1/4 inch in width.  Into each
joint in the concrete shall be poured clean dry sand, its entire length.  The

94.03   Control of hazardous substances or hazardous materials
   
94.04   Hazardous materials or hazardous substance incident expense recovery
§ 94.01  FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds that:
   (A)   Supplies and equipment used during hazardous material responses are a
continuously increasing expense for the city;
   (B)   Supplies needed for hazardous material responses are often
specifically fabricated materials that absorb spilled products without
deterioration and are, therefore, very costly;
   (C)   Much of the equipment used at such responses must be replaced after
only a few episodes, depending upon the amount of exposure and the material
encountered;
   (D)   Overtime personnel are often called back to assist in neutralizing the
situation or are deployed on reserve apparatus during such responses;
   (E)   Recipients of aid or emergency relief and services should be assessed
for those extraordinary costs incurred and payable to third parties for
services rendered by such third parties and/or for replenishing supplies and
equipment in the performance of the aid or emergency services expended;
   (F)   Subject to the provisions herein contained, the reimbursement for such
expenses by the direct recipients of the benefit is appropriate given the
disproportionate relationship in the amount of such costs and the general
benefit to the city and providing for the reimbursement of such extraordinary
expenses is in the best interest of the general welfare, health and safety of
the residents and of the city.

involving a mobile food vendor that has been licensed by the city as provided
within City of LaSalle ordinances. This is also subject to a permit therefor
having been authorized by the city through the joint approval of the Economic
Development Director and the Mayor; further, in the event that said parties are

food vendor commencing with fiscal year beginning May 1, 2019.

retailer that has filed a return pursuant to §
115.04(C) shall be deemed to have registered in accordance with this section.
   (B)   Every telecommunications provider who has registered with the city
pursuant to division (A) above has an affirmative duty to submit an amended
registration form or current return as required by §

§ 115.03  MUNICIPAL TELECOM- MUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEE.
   (A)   A city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is hereby
imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of 1% of all gross
charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to service addresses within
the city for telecommunications originating or received in the city.
   (B)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this subchapter, the city infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the city by telecommunications retailers. 
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this subchapter
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or
imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.
   (C)   The city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
by this section shall be  collected, enforced, and administered as set forth in
§
115.04.

§ 115.04  COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
INFRAS- TRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEES.
   (A)   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from each
customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the city infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer’s service address.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the city, the infrastructure maintenance
fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the city not later
than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in which a bill is
issued to the customer; provided, however, that the telecommunications retailer
may retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the city infrastructure maintenance
fee collected by it to reimburse itself for expenses incurred in accounting for
and remitting the fee.
   (C)   Remittance of the municipal infrastructure fee to the city shall be
accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the city, which shall
contain such information as the city may reasonably require.
   (D)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this subchapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by
such telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the city. The charge imposed under division (A)
by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this subchapter shall constitute
a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who provides such
services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as
the original charge for such services.
   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this subchapter, whether
as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due or to become due under
this subchapter from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the city may request, and the telecommunications
retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such credit. However, no
claim for such credit  may be made more than 3 years after the date of the
erroneous payment unless: (1) the credit is used only to offset a claim of
underpayment made by the city within the applicable statutory period of
limitations, and (2) the credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.
   (F)   Amounts paid under this subchapter by telecommunications retailers
shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts:
      (1)   Gross charges for purposes of the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act
(ILCS Ch. 35, Act 630, §§ 1 et seq.);
      (2)   Gross receipts for purposes of the municipal utility tax as
prescribed in Section 8-11-17 of the Illinois Municipal Code (ILCS Ch. 65, Act
5, § 8-11-17);

as prescribed in Section 8-11-17 of the Illinois Municipal Code (ILCS Ch. 65,

      (4)   Gross revenue for purposes of the tax on annual gross revenue of
public utilities prescribed in ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 2-202, the Public
Utilities Act.
   (G)   The city shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books
and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this subchapter to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
city for the city infrastructure maintenance fee.  Any underpayment of the
amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the city plus 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by
the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit.  Said sum shall be paid to
the city within 21 days after the date of issuance of any invoice for same.
   (H)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, may promulgate such further or
additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of this
subchapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to
time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to §
115.02 of such regulations.

   (B)   Standards for construction on, over, under, or within use of or repair
of the public rights-of-way, including standards relating to freestanding

shall only be effective during the time the infrastructure maintenance fee
provided for in this subchapter is subject to being lawfully imposed on the
telecommunications retailer and collected by the telecommunications retailer
from the customer.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified mail/
return receipt requested to each telecommunications retailer with whom the city

FRANCHISE TERMS; OPERATION OF SYSTEM
§ 116.20  GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The municipality, to the full extent that it may do so, hereby grants
to the company, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this
chapter, the right, privilege and franchise to establish, construct, operate
and maintain the system in, upon, over and under the public right-of-way and
within easements or other rights to use municipal property which are effective
for the purposes of the grant. However, nothing herein shall be construed to
include the use of municipally-owned utility poles without receiving reasonable
rental therefor, and as used in this paragraph, reasonable rental shall be not
more than the highest rate paid by any public utility operative in the
municipality. Upon acceptance of the grant hereunder, the company agrees to
extend the system to and offer the services of the system to all potential
subscribers within the municipality subject to the provisions of §§
116.01 through
116.03,
116.20 and
116.21; to acquire by lease, license, purchase or other right-to-use equipment,
facilities and improvements, and land constituting all or part of the system,
to connect subscribers to the system; and to repair, replace, enlarge and
extend the system.
      (1)   Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable system as
necessary, as desirable, or as required, pursuant to the terms of this
agreement within the municipality. Whenever grantee shall receive requests for
service from at least 5 subscribers within 660 cable-bearing strand feet (1/
8 cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its cable
system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for such extension.
The 660 feet or any multiple thereof shall be measured in extension length of
grantee’s trunk and feeder cable required for service located within the public
right-of-way or an easement grantee may obtain.
      (2)   No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for a
subscriber who is more than 150 feet of distance from distribution cable to
connection of service to subscriber, or a density of less than 5 subscribers
per 660 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, cable service
may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of
construction, including costs of material, labor and easements. For the purpose
of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be
borne by grantee and subscriber(s) in the area in which cable service may be
expanded, grantee shall provide 132 feet of trunk and/or feeder cable per
subscriber, which is the number of feet of trunk and/or feeder which would be
provided under the formula set forth in herein. Potential subscriber(s) will
bear the remainder of the construction and other costs.
      (3)   On or before January 31 of each year, grantee shall furnish a
written report and map to the municipality showing the location of the cable
system within the municipality as of the preceding January 1.
      (4)   Grantee shall offer all residential services at uniform rates and
classifications, provided rates within classifications are uniform.
   (B)   The term of the grant shall be 10 years. The term shall begin on the
effective date set forth in §
116.05 of this chapter.
   (C)   The grant shall not be exclusive. The municipality may make the same
grant or a different grant to the company or to any other person during the
term of the grant. However, the municipality will not authorize or permit
another system to operate within the franchise area on terms or conditions more
favorable or less burdensome to such system operator than those applied to the
company pursuant to this chapter. If any such franchise is granted on terms
more favorable to the grantee thereof than those contained herein, then the
company shall have the right to comply with all the terms of such other
franchise in lieu of compliance herewith. Additionally, if the municipality
authorizes another system to operate within the franchise area, it shall do so
on the condition that such system reimburse and hold harmless the company from
and against all costs and expenses incurred in strengthening poles, replacing
poles, rearranging attachments, placing underground facilities, and all other
costs, including those of the company, the municipality and any utilities.
(Ord. 1416, passed 5-25-1993)
§ 116.21  USE OF MUNICIPAL STREETS.
   (A)   All system facilities erected, constructed or placed by the company
within the municipality shall be located so as not to interfere with the proper
use of the public right-of-way and to cause minimum interference with the
rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the
public right-of-way and not to interfere with existing municipal or public
utility installations. All service lines shall be underground in those areas
providing telephone or electrical service underground at the time of
installation. In areas where telephone or electric utility facilities are above
ground at the time of installation, the company may install its service
aboveground. In those areas where telephone and electric utility facilities are
both above ground and underground at the time of installation, the company
shall install its services underground.
   (B)   In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other
surfacing, the company shall, at its own expense, and in the manner required by
applicable municipal ordinances or policies, replace and restore all paving,
sidewalk, driveway or other surface of any street or alley disturbed to a
condition reasonably comparable to the condition of such paving, sidewalk,
driveway or other surface of any street or alley disturbed existing immediately
prior to such disturbance. In case of any disturbance on either private or
public property, the land surface, including plantings and trees, shall be
restored by the company to substantially its previous condition.
   (C)   If at any time during the period of the franchise the municipality
shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade or location of any street,
alley or other public way, the company shall, upon not less than 5 business
days’ notice for repairs or 90 days notice for major construction by the
municipality, remove, relay and relocate affected system facilities at its own
expense, and in each instance comply with the requirements of the municipality;
provided, however, the company shall in all cases have the right of abandonment
of its property. The company shall be entitled to seek reimbursement of
expenses related to such move if provided by state or federal law.
   (D)   The company agrees to provide 1 channel for use by the municipality,
such channel to be shared by municipality and other franchised municipalities
in LaSalle and Bureau County areas. The company may make use of any unused
program time on such channel subject to the provisions of the Cable Act.
   (E)   The company shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit
issued by the municipality, temporarily move affected system facilities to
permit the moving of buildings, the expense of such temporary removal to be
paid in advance by the person requesting such removal, and the company shall be
given not less than 1-week advance notice to arrange for such temporary moves.
   (F)   The company shall have the authority, except when in conflict with
existing municipal ordinances, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the
public right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with system facilities.
   (G)   The municipality shall have the right to install and maintain free of
charge upon the property of the company its own equipment, including, but not
limited to, its police and fire system and emergency services and disaster
communications system, on the condition that such equipment does not interfere
with the company’s current or future establishment, construction, operation and
maintenance of the system. The municipality hereby indemnifies the company
against all claims, demands, costs or liabilities of every kind and nature
whatsoever, except the negligence of the company, arising out of the
municipality’s use of the company’s property, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
   (H)   If the company seeks to construct and maintain its cables and other
system facilities on or above public or private property, and an easement for
such use has already been granted to a telephone company, or electric or other
public utility, said easement shall, if at all possible, be interpreted so as
to grant the company the same rights and privileges as have been granted to the
telephone and electric companies and other public utilities. In such easements,
the words telephone or telephone company, electric company and the like, shall
be interpreted to include the company.
(Ord. 1416, passed 5-25-1993)
§ 116.22  JURISDICTION OF GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The grant shall apply within the corporate limits of the municipality,
including all territory hereafter annexed to the municipality.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the grant, the company has or will obtain all
necessary federal, state and local government permits,’ licenses and other
required authorizations in connection with the establishment, construction,
operation and maintenance of the system and will file copies of same with the
Clerk of the municipality.
   (C)   Where the density of residential dwelling and occupied commercial or
industrial structures, adverse terrain, or other factors render extension of
the system and offer of cable service impractical or technically infeasible or
creates an economic hardship, the municipality may, upon petition of the
company, either waive the extension of the system into such areas, or allow the
extension and offer of services on such special terms, conditions and
provisions as are reasonable and fair to the municipality, the company, and
potential subscribers in such areas.
(Ord. 1416, passed 5-25-1993)
§ 116.23  RATE PAYMENT.
   Unless the company provides a longer time, subscribers shall pay connection
charges and 1-month’s service charges at the time of installation.
(Ord. 1416, passed 5-25-1993)

   (A)   The company shall pay to the municipality for the right, privilege and
franchise in connection with the grant, an amount equal to 5% of the gross
revenues for the quarter year (the franchise fee) (or in the case of the first
quarterly early payment, part of a quarter-year as the case may be), preceding
January 1, April 1, July 1 and September 1 of each year, such payment to be
payable to the municipality within 45 days of the end of the prior quarter.
Each payment shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an official or
representative of the company having the requisite knowledge to make such a
certificate in the form described herein certifying the gross revenues upon
which the payment is based.
   (B)   Delinquent payments of the franchise fee shall bear interest at the
rate of 1½% per month with the minimum delinquency being a 1-month interest
charge.
   (C)   Upon termination of the grant at the expiration of the term provided
in §
116.20(B), or otherwise, the company shall continue to make the quarter-yearly
statements and certifications as provided in this section until such time as

existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the city fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the city in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the
ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day
after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the city. The receipt of the
deemed approved notice shall not preclude the city’s denial of the permit
request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (c)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the city fails to approve or

the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the city’s denial of the permit
request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (d)   1.   The city shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this.
            2.   If the city determines that applicable codes, ordinances or
regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and
conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            3.   The city shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
city denies an application.
            4.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city
and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial
is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The city
shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the city’s review period.
            5.   The applicant must notify the city in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            6.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the

within the jurisdiction of the city shall be allowed, at the applicant’s
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the city may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits.
         (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
city makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified

accordance with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
            (d)   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and
the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
            (e)   The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in division (C)(3)(d). Failure to remedy
the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
         (4)   (a)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
            (b)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small
wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the city
utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the
wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of
the pole. For purposes of this division (C)(4)(b), the terms COMMUNICATIONS
SPACE, COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
         (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
         (6)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable

written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
         (7)   Alternate placements.
            (a)   Except as provided in division (C), a wireless provider shall
not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific
utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate
multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an
application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a
new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be
collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure
within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept
if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
            (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in division (C)(7).

on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit in conformity with the procedures, terms
and conditions set forth within the zoning ordinances of the city, specifically
including, but not limited to, §§
153.075(A) through (E)(10) inclusive.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable

      (11)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application
to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless facility addressed
in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability.

the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation,
wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, and the like) below the
base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with §
151.07.
         (d)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with §
151.07. All of the building’s structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
         (e)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be

§ 151.12  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the City of LaSalle or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 2282, passed 6-27-2011)
§ 151.13  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City of
LaSalle to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program to
the extent in any manner inconsistent herewith including, but not being limited
to Ordinance Number 1746 passed and adopted 08-20-2001. However,
notwithstanding anything else contained herein suggesting to the contrary, this
chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

§ 151.99  PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the City of LaSalle Building
Inspector may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
chapter exists. The City of LaSalle Building Inspector shall notify the owner
in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after 10 days notice to correct the violation:

revoked until a hearing is held by the City Planning Commission. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City
Planning Commission shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of LaSalle from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations.  All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

condition to the issuance of the license prior to the occupancy by a tenant and
prior to the issuance of the initial license and/or after any change in

in the event that the residential rental premises involved in the change of
tenancy have passed inspection satisfactory to the Building Inspector within 90
days preceding the change in adult tenancy. Additional inspections shall be
allowed to the city upon a request of a tenant or owner, or upon the city
determining that probable cause exists for a violation of the provisions of
this chapter and/or any other city code for the purpose of determining whether
the residential rental property is in compliance with all applicable property
maintenance laws, and further in compliance with the city’s zoning ordinance,
and all other applicable provisions of this chapter of the LaSalle City Code.
Any such inspection shall also within the discretion of the Building Inspector
include a physical inspection of the residential property including the
building exterior, common areas, basement and all individual units of the
rental residential property.
   (B)   That notwithstanding the provisions within division (A) of this
section, in the event that the owner shall have provided written notice to the

return receipt requested, addressed to the City of LaSalle Building Inspector
c/o 745 Second Street, LaSalle, IL 61301 or to the e-mail address of the City
of LaSalle Building Inspector presently at c.covert@lasalle-il.gov and in the
further event that following receipt of said notice the city shall not within 5
days perform an inspection then in that event the premises may be leased and
occupied by tenants without the issuance of the license, with the city however
retaining the right to reasonably inspect the premises regarding said initial
issuance and/or change of occupancy within 90 days of said written notice.
   (C)   When a licensing inspection of a rental residential property reveals
any violations of applicable ordinances, a compliance time frame will be set by
the Code Official. In establishing a compliance time frame, the Code Official
shall determine the reasonable minimal time necessary to correct the violations
based upon the number and severity of the violations. In the event that the
property is unoccupied at the time that an inspection of a rental residential
property reveals any violations of applicable ordinances, the Building
Inspector shall have the discretion to require, depending upon a circumstance
as deemed appropriate within the appropriate exercise of discretion by the
Building Inspector that corrections in regard to the full remediation and
compliance be made prior to the residential rental property being allowed to be
reoccupied. The Code Official shall send notice to the property owner or the
listed property agent by regular U.S. mail at the last address provided on the
most recent license application. The notice shall include the following:
      (1)   Description of the property sufficient for identification;
      (2)   A statement listing the violations of applicable ordinances;
      (3)   A statement of the date upon which the licensing re-inspection will
occur; and
      (4)   An explanation that if upon completion of the licensing re-
inspection that the requirements of applicable city ordinances have not been
met, a written denial of the license application revoking the temporary
certificate will be issued.
   (D)   A licensing re-inspection will be conducted as provided above in the
event of change of tenancy, which per the definition of this chapter shall
include change in adult occupancy. The license shall remain in effect upon the
successful completion of a licensing re-inspection that determines the rental
residential property meets the requirements of applicable city ordinances. If
the Code Official finds that the requirements of applicable city ordinances
have not been met, or that any information provided in the license application
is false, the license shall be suspended or revoked in accordance with §
152.08.
   (F)   Applications for license renewals shall be made in the same manner as
for new applications except that such applications shall state thereon such
fact.

§ 152.08  LICENSE; SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   A license may be suspended when violations of applicable city
ordinances, state statutes and/or state regulations have been identified by the
department and the property owner has been properly notified of the violations
and given a reasonable period of time in which to correct violations, but has
failed to do so. A license may also be suspended when any information provided
in the license application is determined by the code official to be false.
   (B)   When an inspection of a licensed rental residential property reveals
any violations of applicable ordinances, a compliance time frame will be set by
the code official using the standard as set forth in §
152.05(E). The Code Official shall send notice to the property owner or the
listed property agent by regular U.S. mail at the last address provided on the
most recent license application. The notice shall include the following:
      (1)   Description of the rental residential property sufficient for
identification;
      (2)   A statement listing the violations of applicable ordinances;
      (3)   A statement on the date upon which a re-inspection will occur; and
      (4)   An explanation that if upon completion of the re-inspection that
the requirements of applicable city ordinances have not been met, that the
license for the rental residential property will be suspended.
   (C)   A re-inspection will be conducted at the end of the compliance time
frame. If the code official finds that the requirements of applicable city
ordinances have not been met upon the completion of such re-inspection, the
license for the rental residential property shall be suspended.
   (D)   When a license is suspended, the code official shall send notice to
the property owner or the listed property agent at the last address provided on
the most recent license application. The notice shall be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or personally served upon the property owner or
the property agent listed on the most recent license application. The notice

revocation of the license unless the Code Official grants such request pursuant
to a showing of good cause by the property owner.
   (F)   Any person whose license has been suspended shall be entitled to
appeal the suspension by filing a petition as set forth in the Property
Maintenance Code Ordinance of the City of LaSalle with the Appeals Board vested
with the authority for considering any such petition. Such an appeal shall
operate as a stay of the revocation until such time as the appeals board
renders a decision on the appeal. A hearing shall be scheduled in accordance
with the provisions of this code and the rules and regulations of the Appeals
Board. The Appeals Board considering any such petition may immediately revoke
the license, continue the suspension to a definite compliance date with
revocation being the penalty for noncompliance, or dismiss the charges and
reinstate the license. The Appeals Board shall render a decision in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter and its rules and regulations.
   (G)   A license may be revoked when a petition for appeal has not been filed
within 20 days following the date of issuance of an order of suspension, or, if
the suspension is sustained after appeal. A license may also be revoked when in
the opinion of the Code Official emergency conditions exist in a rental
residential property that require the immediate vacating of a structure as
specified in the city’s property maintenance code.
   (H)   A license which has been properly revoked as herein provided shall not
be reinstated. The property owner may, however, obtain a new license after all
violations have been corrected and by following the procedures for obtaining a

applicable fees.

provided on the most recent license application. The notice shall be sent by

§ 153.148  SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Relations to adjoining street system.  The arrangement of streets in
new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the existing
streets in adjoining areas (or their proper projections where adjoining land is
not subdivided) insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public
requirements.  The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be less
than the minimum widths established herein.  The street and alley arrangements
shall not be such as to crate hardship for owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access to it.  Off-set streets
shall be avoided.  The angle of intersection between minor streets and major
streets shall not vary by more than 10 degrees from a right angle. Streets
obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of the
existing streets.  Proposed street names that are in conflict with existing
street names shall not be approved.
   (B)   Street and alley width.
      (1)   The widths and locations of major streets shall conform to the
widths and locations designated on the major street plan.
      (2)   The minimum width for major streets shall be 50 feet.  When streets
adjoin subdivided property, a half street at least 30 feet in width may be
dedicated, and whenever subdivided property adjoins a half street the remainder
of streets shall be dedicated.
      (3)   Alleys shall not be provided in a residential block.  Alleys are
required in the rear of all business lots and shall be at least 20 feet wide.
   (C)   Easements.  Easements of at least 5 feet in width shall not be
provided and dedicated on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot
lines, where necessary for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers,
gas water or other mains.  Basements of greater width may be required along or
across lots where necessary for the extension of main sewers of other utilities
or where both water and sewer lines are located in the same easement.
   (D)   Blocks.
      (1)   No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet or shorter than 500 feet 
between cross streets. Blocks over 1,000 feet in length shall have a cross-walk
with a right-of-way of at least 10 feet in width near the center of the block.
      (2)   In platting residential lots containing less than 15,000 square
feet, the depth of the block shall be between 200 feet and 300 feet.
      (3)   Subdivisions need not follow normal street arrangement. Courts,
dead end streets, or other arrangements, may be provided if proper access  is
given to all lots from a dedicated street or court.  All dead end streets shall
terminate in a dedicated street space having a minimum radius  of 50 feet. 
Dead end street shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length.
   (E)   Lots.
      (1)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building site, properly related to
topography  and the character of the surrounding development.
      (2)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines except where a variation of this rule
will provide a better street and lot layout.  Lots with double frontage shall
be avoided.
      (3)   No lot shall have a depth of less than 100 feet or a depth in
excess of 3 times its width.  No lot shall have an area or width less than that
required by any zoning ordinance adopted as part of the official plan.
      (4)   Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the
establishment of front building lines on both the adjoining streets.
      (5)   Lots fronting on major street intersections and acute angle
intersections of less than 85 degrees shall have a radius of 20 feet at the
street corner.  On business lots a chord may be substituted for the circular
arc.
   (F)   Building lines.  Street set back building lines conforming with zoning
regulations or the standards of the official plan shall be shown on all lots.
   (G)   Maintenance of improvements outside corporate limits.  Where a
subdivision outside the corporate limits  contains sewers, sewage treatment
plants, water supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical
facilities necessary or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of
common use or benefit and which the city does not desire to, or cannot
maintain, provision shall be made by trust agreements made a part of the deed
restrictions acceptable to the city, for the proper and continuous maintenance
and supervision of facilities by the lot owners in the subdivision.
   (H)   Parks, schools sites, etc.
      (1)   Where an area being subdivided includes lands proposed to be used
for parks or schools, under the duly adopted official plan of the city, the
subdivider shall dedicate such lands to the proper public agency as a part of
subdivision plat; provided, however, that such dedication need not exceed 7½%
of the total area of the subdivision plat.  Where such land exceed 7½% of the
total area of the subdivision plat, the part of such lands in excess of 7½% of
the total area shall also be shown on the plat and arrangements made for
purchase of such lands by the proper public agency in a period of not less than
3 years from the date of approval of the plat, said purchase to be consummated
within 3 years from the date approval of final plat.
      (2)   Where less than 7½% of an area being subdivided consists of land
proposed for parks or schools under the official plan, the subdivider shall
dedicate any lands so proposed and pay the city a sum of money so that either
or both the dedication and the payment equal 7½% of the appraised value of the
land before it is subdivided.  Sums so received shall be placed in a special
fund to be known as the Subdivision Park and School Site Purchase Fund and used
by the Council solely for purchase of land for parks or schools in accordance
with the official plan and after receipt of recommendations of the Commission. 
Value of the land shall be made by 3 qualified appraisers, 1 of whom shall be
appointed by the Council, 1 of whom shall be appointed by the subdivider and 1
of whom shall be mutually agreed upon by the 2 appraisers named above.  The
subdivider may agree with the city on an installment method of payment based on
the sale of the lots.
   (I)   Easements along streams.  Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in any area which is being subdivided, the
subdivider may provide an adequate easement as determined by the City Engineer
along each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping,
improving or protecting the stream.

definition of a SMALL SUBDIVISION as defined within §
153.146 of this chapter, as determined by the joint decision of the City of
LaSalle City Engineer and Building Inspector, then a preliminary and final plat
of said small subdivision may be approved by the city by the joint approval of
the city’s Building Inspector and City Engineer subject to final approval by
the City Council without the necessity of a hearing before the city’s Planning
Commission in such a small subdivision. Additionally, regarding a subdivision
that meets the requirements of constituting a small subdivision in the
appropriate exercise of the joint discretion of the Building Inspector and City
Engineer of the city, further provided that said subdivision contains a
division into not more than three 3 lots, the requirement of a formal “plat of
subdivision” may be waived and excepted provided that in lieu of a formal “plat
of subdivision” there shall be a land survey certified by a registered land
surveyor clearly delineating the corners of all lots and further staking the

      (2)   In the event that an applicant shall not obtain approval of a
subdivision of land through this expedited process within 30 days of the
submission of an application for approval, the applicant and/or proponent of a
proposed small subdivision of land may request a hearing regarding
consideration of approval of said plat of subdivision before the city’s
Planning Commission and for eventual consideration of said request for approval
by the City Council, subject to all appropriate lawful provisions of the city
ordinances and state law.
   (B)   Additional exceptions. Whenever the tract of land in connection with
any proposed subdivision of land is of such unusual size or shape or surrounded
by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the
requirements contained within this City of LaSalle Subdivision Subchapter would
result in real difficulties or substantial hardship or injustice, the Council,
after report by the Commission, may accept, modify and/or waive such
requirements so that the subdivider may develop his, her or its property in a
reasonable manner but so that at the same time, the public welfare and
interests of the city and surrounding area are protected and the general intent
and spirit of the Subdivision Subchapter of the City of LaSalle Ordinances is
preserved. It is additionally expressly provided that in the further event that
a subdivision of land suggested to potentially comply with the provisions of a
small subdivision into not more than 3 lots has not otherwise been approved as
provided in division (A) of this section, a waiver and/or exception as provided
by this division (B) may be considered by the City of LaSalle Planning
Commission and the City Council and can also include a waiver of a formal plat
of subdivision provided that the subdivision meets the definition and criteria

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 153.160  PURPOSE.
   Planned developments are intended to allow greater design flexibility than
is permitted by the standard district regulations. A planned development can
best adapt to the topography and other natural characteristics of a given site
and result in a more economical and stable development. It is intended that
these regulations will encourage and facilitate development which is consistent
with the spirit and intent of this subchapter, be in conformity with the
general character of the city and have a beneficial effect upon the health,
safety, general welfare and stability of the city and its immediate environs
than would develop under strict conformity with district regulations. Under
certain conditions the permitted uses in district may be increased. Planned
developments are of such substantially different character from other
conditional uses that the following standards are established to guard against
use of the planned development technique solely as a means of intensifying the
use of land, and to provide flexibility that will stimulate sound and
imaginative design.
(Ord. 1959, passed 5-22-2006)
§ 153.161  PREAMBLE.
   In addition to the general purpose of this subchapter, the purpose of these
provisions is to establish standards and procedures for planned unit
developments and is included in the Zoning and Subdivision Codes in order to
achieve the following purposes:
   (A)   Encourage more creative design and development of land.
   (B)   Promote variety in the physical development pattern of the city.
   (C)   Provide flexibility in the development of land and in the design of
structures located on the land, and permit planned diversification in the
location of such structures that might not otherwise be achieved due to the
strict applications of the Zoning Code.
   (D)   Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the
relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures in
developments conceived as cohesive unified projects.
   (E)   Provide for functional, aesthetic and beneficial uses of open areas.
Preservation of natural features of the city.  Preserving natural vegetation
areas, topography and geologic features by using a creative and efficient use
of land.
   (F)   Provide means for greater creativity and flexibility in environmental
design than is provided under strict application of the requirements of other
zoning districts, while at the same time preserving the health, safety, order,
convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the city and its residents.
   (G)   Allow flexibility in development of land as necessary to meet changes
in technology and demand what will be in the best interest of and consistent
with the general intent of the comprehensive guide plan of the city.
   (H)   Provide for the more efficient allocation and maintenance by private
initiative of useable open space to all residential and commercial areas and to
allow the most efficient use of public facilities and land in keeping with the
best interests of the city.
   (I)   To provide and allow for the development of property as condominiums
amongst other types of appropriate development.
(Ord. 1959, passed 5-22-2006)

contemplated that planned unit developments will include modifications from
otherwise existing zoning and subdivision requirements, and it is contemplated
that in connection with the concept of planned unit developments, planned unit
developments may be approved notwithstanding that the development would not
otherwise be in conformance with the Zoning and/or Subdivision Code but for the
developments approval as a planned unit development consistent with the terms
and provisions set forth herein. The development plan shall include, as a
minimum, the following:
   (A)   A written statement justifying the need for a planned development.
   (B)   *An accurate topographic and boundary line map of the project area and
a location map showing its relationship to surrounding properties.
   (C)   *The pattern of public and private roads, driveways and parking
facilities, and intended design standards. A traffic impact study may be
required.

§ 153.201  STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS.
   Personal wireless telecommunication facilities will be permitted to be
placed in right-of-way within the jurisdiction of the city as attachments to
existing utility poles, alternative antenna structures, or city-owned
infrastructure subject to the following regulations:
   (A)   Number limitation and co-location. The Mayor or his or her designee
may regulate the number of personal wireless telecommunications facilities
allowed on each utility pole or unit of city-owned infrastructure. No more than
2 personal wireless telecommunications facilities will be permitted on utility
poles or alternative antenna structure of 90 feet or less. No more than 3
personal wireless telecommunications facilities will be permitted on utility
poles or alternative antenna structures in excess of 90 feet and less than 120
feet. This subchapter does not preclude or prohibit co-location of personal
wireless telecommunication facilities on towers or monopoles that meet the
requirements as set forth elsewhere in this section or as required by federal
law. Additionally, no personal wireless telecommunications facilities will be
permitted on utility poles or alternative antennae structures in excess of 50
feet, without first having obtained a special use permit pursuant to procedures
set forth within the zoning provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Separation and clearance requirements. Personal wireless
telecommunication facilities may be attached to a utility pole, alternative
antenna structure, monopole, or city-owned infrastructure only where such pole,
structure or infrastructure is located no closer than a distance equal to 100%
of the height of such facility to any residential building and no closer than
300 feet from any other personal wireless telecommunication facility. A
separation or lesser clearance may be allowed by the Mayor or his or her
designee as an administrative variance to this subchapter when the applicant
establishes that the lesser separation or clearance is necessary to close a
significant coverage or capacity gap in the applicant’s services or to
otherwise provide adequate services to customers, and the proposed antenna or
facility is the least intrusive means to do so within the right-of-way.
   (C)   City-owned infrastructure. Personal wireless telecommunication
facilities can only be mounted to city-owned infrastructure including, but not
limited to, streetlights, traffic signal, towers or buildings, if authorized by
a license or other agreement between the owner and the city.
   (D)   New towers. No new monopole or other tower to support personal
wireless telecommunication facilities in excess of 60 feet is permitted to be
installed on right-of-way within the jurisdiction of the city unless the City
Council finds, based on clear and convincing evidence provided by the
applicant, that locating the personal wireless telecommunications facilities on
the right-of-way is necessary to close a significant coverage or capacity gap
in the applicant’s services or to otherwise provide adequate services to
customers, and the proposed new monopole or other tower within the right-of-way
is the least intrusive means to do so.
   (E)   Attachment limitations. No personal wireless telecommunication antenna
or facility within the right-of-way will be attached to a utility pole,
alternative antenna structure, tower, or city-owned infrastructure unless all
of the following conditions are satisfied:

grade. In the event that the operator of a personal wireless telecommunication
facility proposes to install a facility where equipment or appurtenances are to
be installed at grade, screening must be installed to minimize the visibility
of the facility. Screening must be installed at least 3 feet from the equipment
installed at-grade and 8 feet from a roadway, which as to site distance from a
roadway shall also require the approval of the City Engineer and/or
Superintendent of Public Works.
      (5)   Height. The top of the highest point of the antenna cannot extend
more than 7 feet above the highest point of the utility pole, alternative
antenna support structure, tower or city-owned infrastructure. If necessary,
the replacement or new utility pole, alternative support structure or city-
owned infrastructure located within the public right-of-way may be no more than
20 feet higher than existing poles adjacent to the replacement or new pole or
structure, or no more than 90 feet in height overall, whichever is less, with
it further being provided that no such pole shall be in excess of 50 feet
without first having obtained a special use permit pursuant to the procedures
set forth within the zoning provisions of this chapter.

building as provided herein is not to be regulated under this chapter for a
stated period if upon consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient
evidence, the Building Inspector determines that the circumstances, which give
rise to the building being eligible for regulation hereunder are clearly
temporary in nature and are either in the process of being addressed or will
soon be addressed by the owner and that therefore regulation of the building
under this chapter would not serve the public health, welfare and safety and
makes written findings in support of the Building Inspector’s decision. The
determination shall be in writing and shall state the factual basis for the
determination. Notice of said determination shall be provided in writing by the
Building Inspector to the person designated by the County of LaSalle as
receiving the real estate tax bill regarding said premises. The contents of
said notice of said determination requiring registration shall include the
following:
      (1)   The Street address of the building or a description sufficient for
identification;
      (2)   A statement requiring the proper owner to register the building
with the department to apply for the necessary permits within 10 days of the
mailing of the notice, and to enclose the building in compliance with this
chapter;
      (3)   A statement requiring the property owner and/or permit holder to
call the department prior to completion of the enclosure in order to schedule
an inspection;
      (4)   A statement whereby the owner or his or her designated agent shall
be responsible for maintaining the property free of any brush, dead or dying
trees, stumps, roots or solid waste material; and that the grass and weeds
shall not exceed 6 inches in height;
      (5)   A copy of this chapter pertaining to registered buildings; and
      (6)   If a violation of the LaSalle City Code of Ordinances is alleged in
connection with the building or premises thereto, the violations shall be
specified in the notice.
   (C)   The owner or responsible party shall apply for vacant building
registration within 10 days of the mailing of the notice.

(Ord. 2479, passed 3-11-2014)
§ 154.12  ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING OPEN BUILDINGS.
   All open buildings, as defined in this chapter, shall be enclosed by the
owner. The enclosure shall comply with the provisions within the City Property
Maintenance Code, §§
150.05et seq., and with the following requirements.
   (A)   All windows shall be secured and all doors covered with a wire mesh,
securely attached to the frame work of either the doors or windows so as to

blight. The wire mesh shall be as provided and defined within §
154.03, herein.
   (B)   All other exterior openings allowing entry of fowl or animals shall be

§ 154.13 FAILURE OF OWNER TO COMPLY WITH THE ENCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SHALL

   (A)   If the owner of the building fails to comply with the notice to
enclose within 10 days after the date of mailing of the notice, the Building
Inspector may file a complaint in the circuit court requesting the enclosure of
the building by the owner. If the owner fails to comply with an order from the
court, the city may cause the structure to be enclosed in compliance with the
City Code.
   (B)   Any open structure which poses an immediate health hazard shall be
enclosed within 24 hours. In the event the structure is not enclosed within 24
hours, the department may enclose or cause the enclosure of the structure.
Should the open structure be in a location or condition so as to be an
emergency, the department may enclose or cause the enclosure of the structure
without delay without first issuing any notice.
   (C)   The cost of enclosure by the city shall constitute a lien on the
property where the building is located. The lien shall consist of a sworn
statement setting out a description, the amount of money representing the cost
and expense incurred, and the date or dates when the cost and expense was
incurred by the city. Upon payment of the costs and expense by the owner or
other persons interested in the property after the notice of lien has been
filed, the lien shall be released and the release may be filed by the owner or
other person interested in the property. The lien may be enforced by
proceedings to foreclose as in cases of mortgages or mechanic’s liens.
   (D)   If the city corrects the violation itself or causes the violation to
be corrected on its behalf, the owner of the property shall nevertheless be
subject to a fine for the code violation as provided for in this chapter in
addition to a lien being placed on the owner’s property. In addition, the city
may also obtain a personal judgment against the owner of the property for the
costs of correcting the violation.
(Ord. 2479, passed 3-11-2014)

$1,000 for a building consisting of more than 20,000 square feet. The initial
and any subsequent registration shall be valid for a period of 3 months. The
registration fee is due at the time of the application for the registration
permit. If at the end of any registration period, the building official
determines that the building does not meet the criteria set forth in §
154.03, the owner will not be required to register the building. If the owner
notifies the building official that the building no longer meets the criteria
set forth in §
154.03, and the Building Official concurs, the owner shall be reimbursed an
amount equal to the number of months remaining in the registration period.
   (B)   Before any building is registered or reregistered, a joint inspection
shall be conducted by the department and any other city department deemed
necessary by the Building Official to determine whether any violations of this
code exist. If an owner or occupant of the building refuses to allow an
inspection or re-inspection to be conducted, an administrative search warrant
may be requested from the circuit court pursuant to the provisions stated in §
152.10.
   (C)   Once a building has been registered, the owner shall obtain a
certificate of occupancy in the manner set forth in Chapter 155 prior to any
occupancy of the registered building.
   (D)   After a building has been registered, or required to be registered by
the department, for a period of three years, no further registration shall be
permitted and the owner shall be required to either obtain permits sufficient
to obtain a certificate of occupancy or demolish the building. At such time,
the department shall undertake a comprehensive inspection of the building for
determining whether the building should be deemed an unsafe or dangerous
building as defined in §
150.21. Any owner who does not obtain such permit or permits within 60 days of
the end of the said three-year period shall be subject to a fine of not less
than $750. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or
on which a violation of this section occurs or continues.

for any change in ownership whatsoever. The registration statement shall be
deemed prima facie proof of the statements therein contained in any
administrative enforcement proceeding or court proceeding instituted by the
city in reference to the building and/or the premises on which the building is
located. Failure to notify the Building Inspector of any change in the
registration information as provided herein within said 21 day period shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.

§ 154.20  ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   The city shall send a notice to the owner by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal or substitute service, for the failure to
complete a vacant building registration application, register the vacant
building, and/or pay the registration fee for a vacant building. Each shall
constitute a separate violation. Proof of mailing of said notice shall be
primia facie evidence of receipt of the notice. The owner shall have twenty-one
days in which to complete a vacant building registration application, register
the vacant building and/or pay the registration fee for a vacant building as
set forth in the notice; if the violation is not resolved within 21 days, the
fine amount shall be the amount of the registration fee due and owing plus not
less than $100 and not more than $750 for each violation; additionally, in the
event that the city is required to perform a search to ascertain the owner, the
owner is responsible to reimburse the city for said costs. Further, an owner
who fails to re-register the vacant building and/or pay the renewal
registration fee as provided herein shall be subject to the same penalties as
set forth above in connection with an owner who originally fails to complete a
vacant building registration application, register the vacant building and/or
pay the registration fee for a vacant building.
   (B)   If the owner of any building fails to comply with the notice to
register within 10 days after the date of mailing of the notice, the Building
Inspector may in addition to the other remedies provided herein file a
complaint in the Circuit Court requesting the registration of the building by
the owner and further requesting compliance with this chapter, amongst other
relief.
   (C)   Additionally, any person who violates any other provision of this
chapter shall be fined not less than $60 and not more than $750 for each
offense, and each day that a violation occurs shall constitute a new and
additional offense in violation of this chapter. Further, again, the remedies
as provided herein are in addition to all other legal and/or equitable remedies
available to the city. Such other remedies include, but are not limited to,
injunctive relief, application to a court of competent jurisdiction for
receiver, demolition, or condemnation, contracting for the repair or purchase
of the premises, or foreclosure of any lien that the city may have thereon.
Each day that a violation of this chapter shall be permitted to continue shall
constitute a separate offense in violation.
