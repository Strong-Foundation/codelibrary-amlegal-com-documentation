§ 30.11 DISASTER REMOTE MEETING POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   The purpose of this policy is to govern the procedure by which the
City of Markham may conduct open or closed meetings by audio or video
conference, without the physical presence of a quorum of the City Council, when
circumstances warrant and only as authorized by Section 7(e) of the Illinois
Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/1 et seq.
      (2)   To the extent that this policy and rules conflict with any other
rule of the City Council, this policy will control during a disaster and while
this policy is activated. This policy hereby applies to all subsidiary boards,
committees, and commissions unless and until such boards, committees, and
commissions adopt their own rules for remote meetings or hearings held during a
disaster and/or pursuant to Section 2.06(g) and Section 7(e), when and if
enacted, of the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
   (B)   Definitions. As used in this chapter.
      ACT. The Illinois Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/1 et seq., including
amendments made thereto by Public Act 101-0640.
      ALDERMAN. One of the four members of the City Council elected from wards
pursuant to state code.
      CITY. City of Markham.
      CITY COUNCIL.  The City Council of the City of Markham consisting of the
Mayor and the four duly elected and/or appointed Aldermen pursuant to this
code.
      CLERK. The City Clerk elected pursuant to this code.
      CODE. The Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.
      DISASTER. An event where the Governor or the Director of the Illinois
Department of Public Health has issued a disaster declaration related to public
health concerns because of a disaster as defined in Section 4 of the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency Act, and all or part of the jurisdiction of the
public body is covered by the disaster area.
      MAYOR. The Mayor of the City of Markham, Cook County, State of Illinois,
as defined by this code.
      MEETING. Any open meeting of the City Council that is subject to the Act.
      POLICY. This disaster remote meeting policy and any modifications that
may be approved from time to time.
      REMOTE MEANS. Video or audio conference only.
   (C)   Activation of remote meetings policy.
      (1)   Open or closed meetings held by remote means, without the physical
presence of a quorum of the City Council, may be held when the Governor or the
Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health has issued a disaster
declaration related to public health concerns because of a disaster as defined
in Section 4 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, and all or part
of the jurisdiction of the public body is covered by the disaster area.
      (2)   Upon such a declaration by the Governor or the Director of the
Illinois Department of Public Health, the Mayor may determine that an in-person
meeting or meeting conducted under the Illinois Open Meetings Act is not
practical or prudent because of the disaster and may activate this policy. Said
determination shall include any specific modifications or requirements related
to in-person meeting attendance as discussed further herein. Any subsequent
modifications that may be necessary during the period of the disaster may be
declared by the Mayor from time to time. The City Council may approve, by
resolution, modifications to conducting meetings under this policy subject to
the limitations of the Act and parameters of this policy.
      (3)   Once this policy is activated, the City Council shall convene open
and closed meetings subject to the parameters of this policy and the Act for
the period of the disaster unless the Mayor earlier determines that there no
longer remains a need for its activation.
   (D)   Disaster remote meeting procedures. When this policy is activated
pursuant to the above division (C), meetings shall be held as follows:
      (1)   At least one member of the City Council, the Mayor, the City
Attorney, or Chief Administrative Officer must be physically present at the
regular meeting location. The Mayor shall determine the official required to
physically attend the meeting. All other Aldermen may participate remotely in
City Council meetings. The Mayor may order some or all Aldermen to participate
remotely. However, the Mayor may declare, or City Council may resolve, that
physical attendance is unfeasible due to the disaster. The Mayor or Council are
not precluded from determining a specific limit on the number of people allowed
to physically attend a meeting. Such determination may be changed from time to
time during the disaster period when this policy is activated as the Mayor and
City Council may deem necessary and proper.
      (2)   Meetings shall comply with any parameters or orders required by the
disaster declaration, any executive orders, rules, regulations, or any other
relevant law.
      (3)   All members of the City Council participating at a meeting,
wherever their physical location, must be verified and shall confirm that they
are able to hear all other participants, all discussion, and any testimony
prior to the meeting commencing. The platform for remote or electronic
attendance and participation at the City Council meeting will be arranged in
advance by the Mayor or his/her designee at least 48 hours prior to the
commencement of the meeting.
      (4)   Each member of the body participating in a meeting by audio or
video conference for a meeting held pursuant to this section is considered
present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum and participating
in all proceedings.
      (5)   All votes conducted while this policy is activated shall be by roll
call with each Alderman's vote on each issue identified and recorded. No voice-
votes for routine, procedural motions or otherwise are allowed.
      (6)   A verbatim record, in the form of an audio or video recording,
shall be kept of both closed and open meetings conducted while this policy is
activated. Verbatim records of open meetings shall be made available to the
public and all verbatim records remain subject to Section 2.06 of the Act. In
addition to a verbatim record, minutes shall be kept and approved by the City
Council as is done for any other open or closed meeting.
      (7)   When circumstances warrant and allow one or more city officials to
be physically present at the regular meeting location, the following rules
shall apply:
         (a)   The number of persons admitted to physically attend an open
meeting may be limited based on the nature of the disaster and any such
limitations shall be stated on the meeting notice as discussed herein.
         (b)   The first persons to be admitted to City of Markham City Council
meetings will be its elected and appointed officers choosing or otherwise
required to attend in person. If the in-person attendance maximum is not met,
the next person(s) to be admitted shall be one member of the Associated or
Local Press. To ensure eligibility for entry, the member of the Press must
email City Clerk, Jennifer Coles, at icoles@cityof markham.net. The first email
received will determine the Press member admitted to any City of Markham City
Council meeting held during the disaster period where this policy is in place.
Thereafter, if the in-person attendance maximum is not met, members of the
public shall be admitted. Admittance will be determined by which member of the
public emails City Clerk, Jennifer Coles, at jcoles@cityofmarkham.net and
requests admittance on a first-come, first-serve basis. If no person requests
admittance via email, admittance shall be granted on a first-come, first serve
basis.
         (c)   At the meeting, persons attending in-person shall comply with
any applicable health or other requirements that may be ordered.
         (d)   Members of the public attending in-person at the regular meeting
location of the city must be able to hear all discussion and testimony and all
votes of the City Council.
      (8)   When in-person attendance at the regular meeting location is not
feasible, in whole or in part, due to the disaster, the city shall make
alternative arrangements, and provide notice of such alternative arrangements
on the meeting notice, as discussed herein, whereby the members of the public
must be able to contemporaneously hear all discussion, testimony, and roll call
votes. Such alternative access may include, but is not limited to, offering an
alternative physical location with a video and audio feed of the meeting, a
telephone conference number, or a web-based access link. The city officer
responsible for posting and/or publishing meeting notices shall be responsible
for compliance with all notice requirements provided by this policy and in
accordance with Public Act 101-0640.
      (9)   In addition to providing any in-person comments, any person
desiring to make public comment may also email their public comment to City
Clerk, Jennifer Coles, at jcoles@cityofmarkham.net by 4:00 p.m. on the day upon
which the City Council holds a meeting during the time when this policy is
activated. Public comments received by email will be read during the public
comment section and will be noted in the meeting minutes. Emailed public
comments must be limited to 200 words, must identify the commenter, and are
limited to one comment per person. If the remote meeting platform allows for
live public comment, then the rules applicable to public comment with respect
to length and number of comments shall be applicable thereto. Nothing herein
shall allow members of the public to speak, interrupt the proceedings, or
otherwise attempt to conduct city business unless otherwise recognized and
allowed by the City Council.
      (10)   All persons unable to attend a meeting in-person or by the
alternative arrangement, and who desire to know if action was taken on an
agenda item by the Mayor and City Council for the City of Markham may contact
City Clerk, Jennifer Coles, at icoles@cityofmarkham.net the following day or
thereafter.
      (11)   Except in the event of a bona fide emergency, 48 hours' notice
shall be given of a meeting to be held pursuant to this policy. Notice shall be
given to all members of the public body, shall be posted on the website of the
public body, and shall also be provided to any news media who has requested
notice of meetings pursuant to subsection (a) of Section 2.02 of the Act. The
meeting notice shall include any modifications and/or restrictions to public
attendance, shall include any alternative arrangements to access the meeting,
shall include the information concerning submission of public comments, and
shall include any and all such other rules or modifications to the meeting
rules as determined by the Mayor and City Council. In addition to the meeting
notice, the city shall endeavor to publicize the alternative arrangements to
access the meeting on the city's website and/or social media channels. In the
event of a bona fide emergency declared by the city:
         (a)   Notice shall be given pursuant to subsection (a) of Section 2.02
of the Act, and the Mayor shall state the nature of the emergency at the
beginning of the meeting; and
         (b)   The public body must comply with the verbatim recording
requirements set forth in Section 2.06 of the Act.

available, one employee must either voluntarily quit or terminate his or her
employment within 90 days of the date in which the two became immediate family.
The choice regarding which employee shall leave shall be made by the employees.
If there is an unwillingness to make a decision, the employee with the least
seniority shall be terminated, unless the City Council determines that the
needs of the city demand otherwise. In the event an employment position that
will not create any prohibited family employment relationship described above
becomes available within one year of the employee’s termination, said position
shall be offered to the terminated employee to the extent he or she is
qualified and able for such position.
   (D)   If, prior to the effective date of this section, two or more immediate
family members are employed within the same city department and no supervisory/
subordinate relationship exists situation exists, those individuals affected
will be allowed to remain in their current positions until such time that a
supervisory/subordinate relationship arises at which time the above-referenced
90-day period shall commence for any employee transfers or resignations.

defined as the employee’s spouse, civil union spouse/partner, dependent child

in-law), sister, brother, grandparent or grandchild.

and independent of every other.
(Prior Code, § 35.73) (Ord. 04-O-1804, passed 7-7-2004)
§ 35.094 DISPOSITION OF GIFTS.
   An officer or employee, his or her spouse or an immediate family member
living with the officer or employee, does not violate this subchapter if the

appropriate charity that is exempt from income taxation under I.R.C. § 501(c)
(3), as now or hereafter amended, renumbered or succeeded.

any elected officer of the city.
   (B)   At the first meeting of the Commission, the initial appointees shall
draw lots to determine their initial terms. Two Commissioners shall serve two-
year terms and the third Commissioner shall serve a one-year term. Thereafter,
all Commissioners shall be appointed to two-year terms. Commissioners may be

Commissioners and official action by the Commission shall require the
affirmative vote of two members.
   (D)   The Mayor, with the advice and consent of the City Council members,
may remove a Commissioner in case of incompetency, neglect of duty or
malfeasance in office after service on the Commissioner by certified mail,
return receipt requested, of a copy of the written charges against the
Commissioner and after providing an opportunity to be heard in person or by
counsel upon not less than ten days’ notice. Vacancies shall be filled in the
same manner as original appointments.
   (E)   The Commission shall have the following powers and duties:
      (1)   To promulgate procedures and rules governing the performance of its
duties and the exercise of its powers;
      (2)   Upon receipt of a signed, notarized, written complaint, to
investigate, conduct hearings and deliberations, issue recommendations for
disciplinary actions, impose fines in accordance with §
35.999 of this chapter and refer violations of §§
35.091 or
35.092 of this chapter to the appropriate attorney for prosecution. The
Commission shall, however, act only upon the receipt of a written complaint
alleging a violation of this subchapter and not upon its own prerogative;
      (3)   To receive information from the public pertaining to its
investigation and to require additional information and documents from persons
who may have violated the provisions of this subchapter;
      (4)   To compel the attendance of witnesses and to compel the production
of books and papers pertinent to an investigation. It is the obligation of all
officers and employees of the city to cooperate with the Commission during the
course of its investigations. Failure or refusal to cooperate with requests by
the Commission shall constitute grounds for discipline or discharge; and
      (5)   The powers and duties of the Commission are limited to matters
clearly within the purview of this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 35.76) (Ord. 04-O-1804, passed 7-7-2004)
§ 35.097 COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   Complaints alleging a violation of this subchapter shall be filed with
the Ethics Commission.
   (B)   Within three business days after the receipt of a complaint, the
Commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice to
the respondent that a complaint has been filed against him or her and a copy of
the complaint. The Commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt
requested, a confirmation of the receipt of the complaint to the complainant
within three business days after receipt by the Commission. The notices to the
respondent and the complainant shall also advise them of the date, time and
place of the meeting to determine the sufficiency of the complaint and to
establish whether probable cause exists to proceed.
   (C)   (1)   Upon not less than 48 hours’ public notice, the Commission shall
meet to review the sufficiency of the complaint and, if the complaint is deemed
sufficient to allege a violation of this subchapter, to determine whether there
is probable cause, based on the evidence presented by the complainant, to
proceed. The meeting may be closed to the public to the extent authorized by
the Open Meetings Act, being 5 ILCS 120. The Commission shall issue notice to
the complainant and the respondent of the Commission’s ruling on the
sufficiency of the complaint and, if necessary, on probable cause to proceed
within seven business days after receiving the complaint.
      (2)   If the complaint is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of §
35.092 of this chapter and there is a determination of probable cause, then the
Commission’s notice to the parties shall include a hearing date scheduled
within four weeks after the complaint’s receipt. Alternatively, the Commission
may elect to notify in writing the attorney designated by the corporate
authorities to prosecute such actions and request that the complaint be
adjudicated judicially. If the complaint is deemed not sufficient to allege a
violation or if there is no determination of probable cause, then the
Commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice to
the parties of the decision to dismiss the complaint, and that notice shall be
made public.
      (3)   If the complaint is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of §
35.091 of this chapter, then the Commission shall notify in writing the

shall transmit to the attorney the complaint and all additional documents in
the custody of the Commission concerning the alleged violation.
   (D)   On the scheduled date and upon at least 48 hours’ public notice of the
meeting, the Commission shall conduct a hearing on the complaint and shall
allow both parties the opportunity to present testimony and evidence. The
hearing may be closed to the public only if authorized by the Open Meetings
Act, being 5 ILCS 120.
   (E)   Within 30 days after the date the hearing or any recessed hearing is
concluded, the Commission shall either dismiss the complaint or issue a
recommendation for discipline to the alleged violator and to the Mayor, or
impose a fine upon the violator, or both. The particular findings in the case,
any recommendation for discipline, and any fine imposed shall be a matter of
public information.
   (F)   (1)   If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file
a written demand for a public hearing on the complaint within seven business
days after issuance of the recommendation for discipline or imposition of a
fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the enforcement of the
recommendation or fine.
      (2)   Within 14 days after receiving the demand, the Commission shall
conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon at least 48 hours’ public notice
of the hearing and allow both parties the opportunity to present testimony and
evidence. Within seven days thereafter, the Commission shall publicly issue a
final recommendation to the alleged violator and to the Mayor or impose a fine
upon the violator, or both.
   (G)   If a complaint is filed during the 60 days preceding the date of any
election at which the respondent is a candidate, the Commission shall render
its decision as required under division (E) within seven days after the
complaint is filed, and during the seven days preceding that election, the
Commission shall render such decision before the date of that election, if
possible.
   (H)   A complaint alleging the violation of this subchapter must be filed
within one year after the alleged violation.
(Prior Code, § 35.77) (Ord. 04-O-1804, passed 7-7-2004)
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY
§ 35.110 ELIGIBILITY.
   To be eligible for the city’s Family and Medical Leave Policy, hereinafter
called “FMLA” benefits, an employee must:
   (A)   Have worked for the city for a total of 12 months; and
   (B)   Have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12-month period preceding the
FMLA leave.
(Prior Code, § 39.25) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.111 LEAVE ENTITLEMENT.
   (A)   A covered employee is entitled to up to a total of 12 weeks of unpaid
leave in a 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   For the birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn
child;
      (2)   For the placement with the employee of a child for adoption or
foster care, and to care for the newly-placed child;
      (3)   To care for an immediate family member, spouse, child or parent
(biological or one who stood in loco parentis, but not a parent-in law) with a
serious health condition; and
      (4)   When the employee is unable to work because of a serious health
condition;
   (B)   Leave to care for a newborn child or for a newly-placed child must
conclude within 12 weeks after the birth or placement.
   (C)   Spouses employed by the same employer may be limited to a combined
total of 12 work weeks of family leave for the following reasons:
      (1)   Birth or care of a child;
      (2)   For the placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to
care for the newly-placed child; and
      (3)   To care for an employee’s parent who has a serious health
condition.
   (D)   Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA leave intermittently
which means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal weekly
or daily work schedule.
   (E)   If FMLA leave is for birth and care or placement for adoption or
foster care, use of intermittent leave is subject to the employer’s approval.
   (F)   FMLA leave may be taken intermittently whenever medically necessary to
care for a seriously ill family member or because the employee is seriously ill
and unable to work.
(Prior Code, § 39.26) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.112 LEAVE AVAILABILITY CALCULATION.
   The city has adopted the “rolling 12-month period” method of calculating
available FMLA leave. In order to determine the amount of available FMLA leave,
the calculation is made each time an employee commences any FMLA leave from
that date, the preceding 12-month period is examined. Any FMLA leave used
during that preceding 12-month period is examined. Any FMLA leave used during
that preceding 12 months is deducted from the 12 weeks annual leave granted by
the FMLA. The employee is entitled to take no more than the remaining balance
of the FMLA leave.
(Prior Code, § 39.27) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.113 SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE.
   (A)   Any employee taking FMLA leave is required to substitute and use any
remaining paid leave benefits which are available or become available during
the FMLA leave.
   (B)   This includes vacation, personal and sick days. This paid leave will
run concurrently with and not in addition to FMLA leave.
(Prior Code, § 39.28) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.114 MEDICAL INSURANCE BENEFITS WHILE ON FMLA LEAVE.
   (A)   The city will maintain in force the medical insurance benefits
provided to the employee prior to taking FMLA leave, under the same terms and
conditions as existed prior to leave. If the employee was required to pay a
portion of the premiums for coverage, that obligation continues while on leave.
   (B)   Payment is expected to be made in the same amounts, and at the same
time (i.e., each payroll date) as was made while working. If any payment is
more than 30 days late, medical coverage will be canceled without further
notice.
   (C)   An employee can elect not to continue medical coverage while on leave.
If this election is made, the city will immediately offer COBRA coverage.
   (D)   If the coverage is continued while on FMLA leave, and the employee
does not return to work at the end of the FMLA leave period, the city will bill
the employee for the amount of premiums paid by the city during the leave
period.
   (E)   No other employment benefits provided by the city are continued during
FMLA leave. All such benefits are instead held in abeyance until the employee
returns to work.
(Prior Code, § 39.29) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.115 PROCEDURE FOR REQUESTING FMLA LEAVE.
   (A)   Any employee desiring to take FMLA leave should contact his or her
supervisor as soon as possible.
   (B)    A request for FMLA leave for the birth of a child or placement of a
foster or adopted child should be made at least before the leave can commence,
or in emergency cases as soon as possible. Leave for any other reason allowed
by the FMLA should be requested as soon as the employee knows the need for FMLA
leave.
   (C)   Any employee taking leave for his or her own serious health condition
or that of a statutory family member must submit a written medical certificate
issued by the attending health care provider on the form which may be obtained
from the employee’s supervisor or the Human Resource Department. Failure to
provide such a certification within 15 days of making the leave request or
commencing leave, whichever is sooner, will result in termination of the leave
and a requirement that the employee immediately return to work, or face
discipline under the city’s attendance policy.
(Prior Code, § 39.30) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.116 CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING FMLA LEAVE.
   (A)   Any FMLA leave taken will be counted against the 12 weeks’ leave per
FMLA leave period allowed by statute. Any employee seeking to return to work
after leave taken because of the employee’s own serious health condition must
submit to a medical certification of fitness to return to duty signed by the
attending health care provider before the employee will be allowed to return to
work. Failure to comply with this requirement does not extend the leave.
   (B)   On return from FMLA leave, the employee will be returned to the same
position the employee held when leave commenced, or to an equivalent position
with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment.
   (C)   The city reserves the right to deny restoration to key employees, as
defined by the FMLA regulations, where restoration will cause substantial and
grievous economic injury to the operation of the city.
   (D)   If the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the
position because of a physical or mental condition, including the continuation
of a serious health condition, the employee has no right to restoration to
another position under the FMLA. The employee may, however, fall under the
Americans with Disability Act (ADA).
(Prior Code, § 39.31) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
§ 35.117 REFERENCE TO FMLA NOTICE POSTER.
   The city has posted in each department a poster setting forth the relevant
provisions of the FMLA. The terms of that poster are incorporated in this
subchapter as if they were specifically set forth. Each employee is charged
with familiarizing himself or herself with the contents of that poster
concerning all applicable employee rights and obligations under the FMLA.
(Prior Code, § 39.32) (Ord. 04-O-1798, passed 4-21-2004)
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 35.130 PROHIBITION.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations, it is a policy of the city to prohibit harassment of
any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 18-O-2191, passed 1-12-2018) Penalty, see §
35.999
§ 35.131 DEFINITION.
   (A)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the state’s Human Rights Act, which currently defines SEXUAL HARASSMENT as any
unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute SEXUAL HARASSMENT includes:
      (1)   Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
      (2)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking”
or “kissing” noises;
      (3)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
      (4)   Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
      (5)   Textual/electronic. “Sexting” (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person”.
(Ord. 18-O-2191, passed 1-12-2018)
§ 35.132 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING ALLEGATION.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself
or himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident
(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her or his
position to the offending employee, and her or his immediate supervisor. It is
not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the
report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her or his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality. The employee
experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume
that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the
victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
state’s Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. 18-O-2191, passed 1-12-2018)
§ 35.133 PROHIBITION OF RETALIATION.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, RETALIATORY ACTION means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
state’s Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, state agency or
other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the state’s Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (F)   According to the state’s Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the state’s Human
Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge, due within 150 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 18-O-2191, passed 1-12-2018)
§ 35.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   (1)   A person who intentionally violates any provision of §
35.091 of this chapter may be punished by a term of incarceration in a penal
institution other than a penitentiary for a period of not more than 364 days,
and may be fined in an amount not to exceed $2,500.
      (2)   Any person who intentionally violates any provision of §
35.092 of this chapter is subject to a fine in an amount of not less than
$1,001, and not more than $5,000.
      (3)   Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of this subchapter to the local enforcement
authorities, the state’s attorney or any other law enforcement official may be
punished by a term of incarceration in a penal institution other than a
penitentiary for a period of not more than 364 days, and may be fined in an
amount not to exceed $2,500.
      (4)   (a)   A violation of §
35.091 of this chapter shall be prosecuted as a criminal offense by an attorney
for the city by filing in the Circuit Court an information, or sworn complaint,
charging such offense. The prosecution shall be under and conform to the rules
of criminal procedure. Conviction shall require the establishment of the guilt
of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.
         (b)   A violation of §
35.092 of this chapter may be prosecuted as a quasi-criminal offense by an
attorney for the city, or, if an Ethics Commission has been created, by the
Commission through the designated administrative procedure.
      (5)   In addition to any other penalty that may be applicable, whether
criminal or civil, an officer or employee who intentionally violates any
provision of §§
35.091 and
35.092 of this chapter is subject to discipline or discharge.
      (6)   The Commission may fine any person who intentionally violates any
provision of §
35.092 of this chapter in an amount of not less than $1,001, and not more than
$5,000. The Commission may fine any person who knowingly files a frivolous
complaint alleging a violation of this subchapter in an amount of not less than
$1,001, and not more than $5,000. The Commission may recommend any appropriate
discipline up to and including discharge.
(Prior Code, § 35.78)
   (C)   (1)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual
harassment. In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable
pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this
policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty Imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
      (2)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
         (a)   A FALSE REPORT is a report of sexual harassment made by an
accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than
stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A
false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given
the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous
report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any
person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any
provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant
to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.
         (b)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the state’s Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

§ 39.16 SCOPE OF LEGISLATIVE ACT; INTENT.

of a municipality without regard to whether such provisions should contain
terms contrary to the provision of current or subsequent nonpreemptive state
law, or legislate in a manner, or regarding a matter not delegated to

the city that to the extent that the terms of this subchapter should be
inconsistent with any non-preemptive state law, that this subchapter shall
supersede state law in that regard within its jurisdiction.

clause:
Contractor agrees that he shall actively solicit bids for the subcontracting of
goods or services from qualified minority business enterprises. At the request
of the city, contractor shall furnish evidence of his compliance with his
minority solicitation requirement. Contractor further agrees to consider the
grant of subcontractors to bidders who are minority business enterprises in a
light favorable to said minority enterprises where proposals are substantially
equal. Contractor further affirms that in obtaining his performance and bid
bonds, he will seek out and attempt to utilize companies which have records of,
and/or which will make commitments to, the bonding of minority contractors on a
rate basis comparable to their bonding of similar non-minority contractors. The
contractor may be required to submit this evidence as part of the bid or
subsequent to it. Contractor further agrees that 50% of its employees who
perform the contractor’s contractual obligations with the city shall be either
members of a minority group or residents of the city, unless such an agreement

seek the participation of minority business enterprises in procurement of goods
and services. Each department of the city shall submit a quarterly report on
the utilization of minority business enterprises to the office of the Mayor.
(Prior Code, § 39.14) (Ord. 86-O-1240, passed 8-6-1986)

developing the work program and purchasing program of the city for each year,
designate specific projects and commodities which are to be preserved for
qualified minority business enterprises. Qualified business enterprises shall
be requested to submit proposals as to their cost of performing such contracts.
Upon approval of the annual budget, the Mayor shall meet with the appropriate
persons to determine those projects and commodities to be designated as reserve
for minority business enterprises. One of the considerations to be made by the
Mayor is the availability of competition among minority business enterprises in
the areas chosen. The Mayor shall not proceed with the program until the
Mayor’s designation of projects and commodities for minority business
enterprises is approved by the City Council as being consistent with city
policy and with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and the Constitutions

an alternative means of protecting the city in the performance of work is
available, a requirement of a performance bond shall not be included as part of
the bid specifications. It is the policy of the city that this procedure should
be utilized when it is determined that the requirement of a performance bond
would tend to discourage minority business enterprises form doing business with
the city.

stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of or in the
possession of the owner at the time of the violation; or

possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit
proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates
was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
(Ord. 07-O-1893, passed 8-15-2007)
§ 72.18 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor
vehicle entering an intersection in violation of §
72.16 of this chapter, the city shall issue a written notice of violation to
the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S.
mail within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the city of
the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event
later than 90 days following the violation. The city shall only be required to
notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee’s name by an
affidavit and a copy of the lease within 60 days of the notice’s issuance. If
the driver information is not provided within 60 days, the leasing company/
lessor may be found liable. If any notice to an address is returned as
undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded
in a United States post office approved database of the owner or lessee of the
cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class mail postage
prepaid.
   (B)   A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law
violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the
Traffic Compliance Administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine
whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of §
72.16 of this chapter, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in § 
72.17 of this chapter is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination
that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the
notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the
manner provided for above. The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall retain a
copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed
to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence
of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding
alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and
shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis
of the defenses established in this subchapter.
   (C)   The notice of violations shall include the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address in a
United States post office approved database;
      (2)   The make (only if discernable) and registration number of the motor
vehicle involved in the violation;
      (3)   The violation charged;

should be paid 14 days from the date of issuance, if a hearing is not
requested, and a statement that the payment of the fine shall operated as a
final disposition of the violation;
      (8)   A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date
noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or
lessee;
      (9)   The amount of the late fee;
      (10)   A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will
result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension
of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle;
      (11)   A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie
evidence of a violation;
      (12)   A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the
fine or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing;
and
      (13)   A statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested.
(Ord. 07-O-1893, passed 8-15-2007; Ord. 11-O-1994, passed 6-15-2011)
§ 72.19 HEARING.
   (A)   The owner of a vehicle being operated in violation of §
72.16 of this chapter may request a hearing by the respond-by-date on the
notice of violation (14 days from the date of issuance) to challenge the
evidence or set forth an applicable defense. The notice of violation shall
constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in
any proceeding alleging a violation of §
72.16 of this chapter. The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of
a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in §
72.17 of this chapter.
   (B)   The owner’s failure to appear at the hearing will result in a finding
of liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a “findings, decision and
order” letter will be sent to the owner. The owner’s failure to pay the amount
by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination.

   (B)   Hazardous or unlawful vehicles may be towed without prior notice;
except that, when an unlawful vehicle is only one that has been reported as
stolen and is not towable for some other specific reason, the owner should be,
when practicable, notified by telephone or other means and given the
opportunity to claim or move the vehicle, if he or she so wishes, to avoid
incurring the expenses of a police-ordered tow. However, the vehicle may be
towed if the owner permitted the tow to be made when the vehicle was reported
stolen or at any time thereafter, in the form provided in Appendix A, § 4, of
this chapter. Within 24 hours after towing a vehicle pursuant to this chapter,

most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and
notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished, though in
no case will the municipality be required to delay towing more than seven days
after the date of the mailing or personal delivery of the notice if no request
for a hearing has been received within that seven-day period.
   (B)   A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest date upon which
the tow may take place and the address and phone number of the Police
Department shall be placed on the vehicle.

§ 90.33 PRE-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner or person entitled to possession of
a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven days after the
date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a
pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be towed,
if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven-day
period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this subchapter will be
deemed waived.
   (B)   Schedule of pre-tow hearings. The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled
for a date within 14 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the pre-tow
notice. The municipality shall not be required to delay towing longer than such
a 14-day period.
   (C)   Request for pre-tow hearings. Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be
made in person to the office indicated on the notice. Requests for hearing by
persons who reside more than 50 miles from the municipality may be made by
mail. Forms for such requests shall be made available at the Police Department.
At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date
and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.
   (D)   Appointment of Hearing Officer. The municipality shall choose an
officer or employee of the municipality to serve as Hearing Officer. In no case
shall that Hearing Officer be an individual who was involved in the initial
decision to tow the vehicle. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to
require the presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow
or any other municipal personnel.
   (E)   Nature of hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant
evidence, the Hearing Officer shall make a written decision based upon a
preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized
by the laws of the state or the code or any applicable ordinances of the
municipality, with a specific statutory, code or ordinance section cited in the
decision. The owner shall be provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Decision to tow and rates to be charged. If the preponderance of the
evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this subchapter,
the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and
storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees to be charged
for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by
the Chief of Police pursuant to the provisions of §
90.34 of this chapter. The owner of said vehicle having had such a hearing may
avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location
to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the
vehicle.
   (G)   Decision not to tow. If the preponderance of the evidence fails to
support towing of the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the
vehicle shall not be towed. The municipality shall furnish a copy of such
decision to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location
plainly visible from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No
vehicle about which such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the
municipality unless the circumstances under which the decision was rendered
have changed. If, at some subsequent time, the municipality should wish to tow
the vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures
required for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.
   (H)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. Originals
or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports and any
associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police
Department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after

   (A)   Mailing or delivery of notice. Notice pursuant to this section shall
be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the

the name of the police officer making the delivery shall be noted in the Police
Department records or reports. The notice shall be in the forms provided in
Appendix A, § 1(A) and (B), of this chapter and shall be mailed or delivered

for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner
of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address
furnished.
   (B)   Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing service
operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least
12 inches by 18 inches, indicating the opportunity and procedures for a hearing
to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the form for which is set
out in
Appendix A, § 1(A), of this chapter, shall be placed in locations readily
visible to the public transacting business at any towing facility. If a towing
service operator performs services for more than one municipality, the
information for contacting the various appropriate municipal offices can be
listed in one such sign, the format for which shall be substantially similar to
the form set out in
Appendix A, § 1(A), of this chapter.
   (C)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in
person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or

establish these facts.
   (E)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates. The owner shall pay
fees to the towing service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered
tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts to be administratively
established by the Chief of Police and which may be revised from time to time.
      (1)   The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign
concerning vehicle release requirements set forth in
Appendix A, § 1(A), of this chapter. However, nothing in this subchapter is
intended to prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging less
than the established maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows.
      (2)   In arriving at the maximum rates for various services, the Chief
shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rates in the area for the
different types of vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for
categories such as large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative
difficulties and amount of work required to perform various types of towing
operations.
      (3)   For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or
serious accidents, the Chief is authorized to allow towing operators to charge
rates above those established for normal situations, which special charges must
be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account such matters
as the man-hours and equipment time required for the job.
      (4)   A towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details
of such a billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow,
and supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner and to the Police
Department. Any such special rates charged must be customary in the towing
industry in the area for the nature and extent of the services provided.
      (5)   Every towing service operator and the Police Department shall have
available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any special rate
policy established by the Chief, for vehicle owners to view upon request.

posting shall be considered a separate offense.

corrective action, the violation has not, in the city's reasonable judgment,

      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   “Obscene” defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:

standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults; except
that, it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;

ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;

   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially
adapted for reproducing multiple copies or the possession of more than three
copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
disseminate.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age; or
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

or distribution that it is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which

provisions.
(Prior Code, § 150.03) (Ord. 06-O-1853, passed 4-5-2006)
§ 150.004 PROPERTY REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
   (A)   Enactment. The city enacts the Property Redevelopment Program for
properties it acquires by a judicial deed or judicial sales deed for the
purpose of putting properties back on the tax roll and so that these properties
can be rehabbed at no cost to the city.
   (B)   Applicants. Under the program to redevelop properties, a person or
legal entity may make a request to City Council to purchase any of the
properties that the city has acquired through the County Circuit Court as
described in this section. The applicant must show that they have the financial
ability to redevelop the property and must submit plans as to how the property
will be redeveloped. The plans must show that the property will be redeveloped
in accordance with the applicable zoning for the location of the property. All
applications must include who will occupy the property as the owner and not a
tenant. In the alternative, it could include a plan of the applicant to sell to
a person or entity that will occupy the property and not rent the property.
   (C)   Rehabilitation. Upon the approval of their application, the applicant
must sign an agreement with the city which will give the applicant six months
to redevelop the property. In the agreement, the applicant will agree to
forfeit any work it completes within the six-month period if it fails to
complete the rehabilitation within the six- month period or within any
extension granted by City Council. The forfeiture in the agreement will include
not only work but supplies and will prevent the applicant from filing any type
of lien against the property. The rehabilitation of the property means that the
property will be repaired to bring it into compliance with all of the current
codes of the city and any amendments thereof. The applicant will be required to
obtain all necessary permits to do any work on the property. Furthermore, the
aforesaid agreement will require the applicant to provide insurance to the city
in which the city is an additional insured for an amount determined by City
Council to be sufficient to protect the city. The applicant will be required to
provide the city with the proof that the city had been added to its insurance
policy as additionally insured before the applicant can be issued any permits
to do work on the property.
   (D)   Sales price. The sales price will be the higher of either the value of
the property determined by an state licensed appraiser or the total of any
costs the city had invested into the property. The calculation of the costs the
city had invested into the property will include but not be limited to
appraisal fees, any outstanding grass cutting fees, outstanding water bills,
outstanding citations fines against the property, and legal fees paid
associated with the property. The City Council can deviate from the aforesaid
determination of the sales price based on the circumstances and facts presented
if it finds it in the best interest of the city to deviate.
   (E)   Conveyance. If the applicant completes the rehabilitation or obtains
an extension by City Council during the six-month period and rehabilitate the
property during the extension, the applicant can request a deed from City
Council. At the time the applicant makes its request, the applicant must
include the amount of the sales price in the form of certified funds to the
city. Upon a determination by City Council that the applicant had complied with
this section, the city will issue the applicant a quit claim deed with no title
insurance or warranties. If the property conveyed to the applicant is used as
rental property, this fact will be taken into consideration if the applicant
ever submits an application to City Council under this program.

previous registration. Said fees shall be used to offset the costs of: (1)
registration and registration enforcement, (2) code enforcement and mitigation

      (4)   When a registrable property is vacant or becomes vacant, the owner
shall designate a property manager to be responsible for the requirements of
this section. The property manager shall be responsible for inspecting,
maintaining and securing the property.
      (5)   If the mortgage and/or servicing on a property is sold or
transferred, the new mortgagee is subject to all the terms of this section.
Within ten days of the transfer, the new mortgagee shall register the property
or update the existing registration. The previous mortgagee(s) will not be
released from the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid fees, fines, and
penalties imposed by the city and accrued during that mortgagee’s involvement
with the registrable property.
      (6)   If the mortgagee sells or transfers the registrable property in a
non-arm’s length transaction to a related entity or person, the transferee is
subject to all the terms of this chapter. Within ten days of the transfer, the
transferee shall register the property or update the existing registration. Any
and all previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties, regardless of who the

previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties imposed by the city and accrued
during that mortgagee’s involvement with the registrable property.

shall be subject to enforcement by any of the enforcement means available to

the necessary action to ensure compliance with and/or place a lien on the
property for the cost of the outstanding obligation and any additional cost
incurred to the property into compliance.
      (12)   Registration of foreclosure property does not alleviate the
mortgagee and/or owner from obtaining all required licenses, permits and
inspections required by applicable code or state statutes. Acquisition of
required licenses, permits and inspections or registration of rental property
does not alleviate the requirement for the property to be registered under this
division. Mortgagee and/or owner is expected to update the status of the
property in the event of a mortgagee managed rental.
      (13)   Properties meeting the requirements of this division are not
required to register under division (D) below.

declared vacant, register the vacant property with the Building and Housing
Department.
      (4)   Each vacant property registration shall be made in writing to the

vacant and abandoned properties, and (3) for any related purposes as may be
adopted in the policy set forth in this section.
      (6)   Changes in registration information. An owner shall notify the
Building and Housing Department within 21 days of any change in the
registration information by filling an amended registration provided by the
Building and Housing Department. A new registration is required for any change

   (E)   Regulations for all registrable property. The owner or mortgagee of a
registrable property shall be responsible for the following:
      (1)   Property maintenance. All registrable properties, including
adjoining yard areas, shall be maintained in compliance with all city
ordinances and remain free of weeds, overgrown bush, dead vegetation, building
materials, accumulation of newspapers, discarded furniture, clothing,
appliances, debris, garbage, graffiti, litter, portable toilets, rodents,
standing water and any other items that give the appearance that the property
is abandoned. All grass and vegetation shall be landscaped and maintained. The

      (4)   Failure of the mortgagee and/or property owner of record to
properly inspect and secure a property subject to this chapter, and post and
maintain the signage noted in this section, is a violation and shall be subject
to enforcement by any of the enforcement means available to the city. The city
may take the necessary action to ensure compliance with this section, and
recover costs and expenses in support thereof.
   (F)   City incurred fees. All fees incurred by the city to maintain, secure,
or otherwise bring a property into code compliance shall be reimbursed to the
city by the owner or mortgagee of the property. Fees shall be as stated in an
invoice from an outside contractor or as designated in the city’s fee ordinance
plus an additional $100 administrative fee per activity. Failure to reimburse
the city may result in a lien of the property pursuant to applicable law.
   (G)   Remedies not exclusive. The provisions of this chapter are cumulative
with and in addition to other available remedies. Nothing contained in this
chapter shall prohibit the city from collecting on fees, fines, and penalties
in any lawful manner; or enforcing its codes by any other means, including, but
not limited to, injunction, abatement, or as otherwise provided by law or
ordinance.

IMPACT FEES
§ 150.035 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   This subchapter is for the purpose of requiring that new construction and
developments pay a fair share of the cost of public facilities and services
through the imposition of an impact fee which will be used to finance, defray
or reimburse the city for all or a portion of the costs of public facilities
and services which serve each developments or new construction. The amount of
each impact fee shall be $5,000 for a single-family home and $5,000 for each
dwelling unit in a multiple-family structure. The impact fee for industrial or
commercial structures shall be calculated by the Building Department based on
the gross square footage of non-residential development, type of density or
intensity of use, trip generation or other appropriate methodology which
ensures that the fee is roughly proportional to the impact of the new
construction or development on public facilities and services. Those
calculations will be based on rules issued from time to time by the Building
Department. The city assumes responsibility for and will pay for with general
city revenues all public facility needs for existing developments.

will act as a bowl and unregulated backfill may create an area of super-
saturated soil which could prove to be a hazard to the public’s safety. The
other consideration is that there may be a future building on the site and the
uncompacted fill would not be adequate to sustain the loading and the new
structure would likely suffer structural damage.

not accumulate in the pool. An inspection of the holes is required prior to
backfill;
            2.   Recommend the top 24 inches of the side walls be removed (18
inches minimum);
            3.   Pool shall be backfilled and compacted to a minimum of 90%
maximum density. No organic or other reducible material shall be incorporated
in fills. No rock or similar irreducible material with a dimension greater than
eight inches shall be buried or placed within 48 inches of the finished grade;
and
            4.   Disconnection and proper termination of the gas, water and
electrical lines will be required prior to final inspection.

measured at the front of the structure and from the top of the finished floor
to the highest point of the building, and shall be no taller than 15 feet in
height. In the event there are significant grade changes on the property as to
expose 18 inches or more of the foundation of the structure, a grading plan
shall be a required component of the building permit application.
   (P)   Retaining wall.
      (1)   Permit fee. Permit fee: 1.5% of estimated cost of construction and
a grading plan.
      (2)   Submittal requirements.

submitted:
      (1)   Letter from the contractor or permit holder requesting permit
cancellation and stating no work has been performed. The letter must include
the permit number, job address, reasons for cancellation and a contact name and
telephone number. If the contractor is no longer available or unwilling to
submit the letter, the request can be made by the property owner. If the permit
is valid at the time of request for cancellation and the permit holder is not
submitting the request, then the property owner will be required to complete a
cancellation letter. Please note that in cases where a cancellation letter is
required there will be a ten working day waiting period prior to cancellation.
Additionally, the Department will notify all interested parties (original
permit holders and all subsidiary permit holders) of the cancellation request;

cancellation request. Following the receipt of the letter and payment of the
cancellation fee, if applicable, a field inspection will be scheduled for the
next business day to confirm that no work was performed. If the performance of
the inspection determines that work was not performed, the permit will be
canceled, However, if work is determined to have been performed an additional
inspection fee will be assessed against the permit. Additionally, one will be
required to complete the work covered under the scope of the permit and obtain
all mandatory inspections. If the permit has expired, one will be required to
have it re-issued prior to proceeding with the work and obtaining the mandatory
inspections. Further, the Department will issue a notice of violation and open
a case in our regulation system to ensure appropriate action is taken. Failure
to do so may result in the issuance of a violation notice or ticket requiring
payment of a fine and correction of the violation. Please be advised that the
request will not be accepted if any of the required documentation is missing or
in cases where work has commenced as evidenced by an inspection result entered
in the computer system. In these cases, the work must be completed and
mandatory inspections obtained. If the permit has expired, it must be reissued
prior to request for mandatory inspections.
   (B)   Cancellations where work has been performed. In the unique instances

removed or superseded by another permit number (provide specific permit
number). The letter must include the permit number, job address and a contact
name and telephone number. If the contractor is no longer available or
unwilling to submit the letter, the request can be made by the property owner;
      (2)   For cases where the work has been removed, the applicant is
required to have the job copy of the plans at the site. An inspection will be
performed to verify the work has been removed. Following the performance of the
inspection, if it is determined the work was removed, then the permit will be
canceled. However, if the work still exists an additional inspection fee will
be assessed against the permit. Additionally, one will be required to complete
the work covered under the scope of the permit and obtain all mandatory
inspections. If the permit is expired, one must have the permit reissued prior
to obtaining mandatory inspections. Further, the Department will issue a notice
of violation and open a case in the regulation system to ensure appropriate
action is taken. Failure to do so may result in the issuance of a civil
violation notice or ticket requiring payment of a fine and correction of the
violation;
      (3)   In cases where a permit has been superseded by a new permit, the
requesting party must submit copies of the permit and plans relating to the old
and new number. An inspection may be scheduled for further determination of the
work performed. Once the Department is satisfied that there is a duplicate, the
permit will be canceled; and
      (4)   If the permit is expired, a fee of $60 is required at time of
cancellation request.
   (C)   Request to surrender permits where the contractor/qualifier is no
longer going to perform work on the project. A contractor who is no longer
going to perform work on a project must send the Department a letter advising

is posted in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling affected by the
notice; and
      (5)   Such notice may contain an outline of remedial action which, if

emergency and requiring that such action be taken as he or she deems necessary
to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subchapter,
such order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is
directed shall comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Board

upon his or her finding as to whether the provisions of this subchapter have
been complied with, the Board shall continue such order in effect, modify it or

dwelling or structure complies with the minimum provisions of the city’s code,
then the city shall issue a passing property inspection report.
   (F)   Violation report, as-is affidavit, inclement weather affidavit. In the
event the property inspection shows the property does not meet the minimum
requirements of this code, the Building and Housing Department shall issue a
violation report.
      (1)   The buyer or transferee of the property shall be required to
execute an “as-is sale affidavit” and take responsibility for correcting the
violations listed within 30 days of transfer. The city may only extend the time

agreed upon extension thereto, the temporary certificate of occupancy shall be
revoked and the owner shall be subject to all citations, fees, fines and legal
action available to the city.
   (G)   Disclaimer. The city does not warrant the condition of any property
inspected and shall not be responsible for any claims arising out of the
property or the condition thereof. The city does not warrant that all
deficiencies are listed in the inspection report and does not warrant anything
as to the condition of the property or the liability thereof. The issuance of
the inspection and transfer stamp and/or temporary certificate of occupancy
shall not operate as a waiver of any right of the city to prosecute an owner or
occupant of any real estate for any violation of any city ordinance.
   (H)   Exempt transfers. Where the city is the transferor of real estate, the
transaction shall be exempt from the requirements of this section and an exempt

civil action is necessary, then the city may recover reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs from the violator.

prohibited from raising any new matter or requiring any further remediation not
contained in his or her original report if the conditions existed as of the
time of the original inspection. Reinspection must occur within five working
days after the city is notified that the dwelling or structure is ready for

appropriate for repairs to be made and completed to the dwelling or structure.
         (b)   With respect to a repair escrow, if reasonable proof that the
repairs have been completed is not received by or shown to the Building
Department or other authorized representative of the city designated by the
governing body of the city, within the escrow time period established by the
Building Department as the time period for said repairs to be completed, the
city at its sole and exclusive option, shall declare the escrow deposit

escrow agreement and shall use the escrow funds to secure, or repair the
structure so that it will be in compliance with the provisions of this
subchapter.
         (c)   If after the lapse of the established time period for repair,
the city secures the repair of the structure, the city shall reimburse itself
from the retained repair escrow funds. No more than 15% of the escrow funds may

construct, a permit to alter or an original license is declined, the Department
shall give the reasons therefore in writing to the applicant; and if the
objections can be corrected, the applicant may amend his or her application and
resubmit it for approval.
   (B)   If a permit to construct or a permit to alter a park has been issued,
the applicant upon completion thereof shall notify the Department. The
Department shall then inspect the park and, if completed in accordance with the
approved plans, shall issue a license for the number of approved sites after
receipt of the required fee.
   (C)   A permit does not relieve the applicant from securing building permits
in municipalities or counties having a building code, or from complying with
any municipal or county zoning or other ordinance applicable thereto. Within
ten days of receiving an application for a permit to construct a new park or
expand a licensed park, the Department shall send a copy thereof, by certified
mail, to the county or municipality in which the proposed park is located.
Construction for which the Department has issued a permit shall not commence

zoning approvals. No license to operate and maintain a mobile home park shall
be issued upon the Department’s being notified, within 60 days of the mailing
of the application to the municipality or county, as provided in this section
by a written certification from the municipal or county zoning board or
commission of any municipality or county that such park is in violation of any
municipal or county zoning or other ordinances and that such park was not in
existence at the time of the passage of such municipal or county zoning or
other ordinances. Upon certification from such municipal or county-zoning board
that such park has complied with the municipal or county zoning or other
ordinances and other requirements of 210 ILCS 115/1 et seq. have been met, such
license shall be issued. Within ten days after such park has complied with the
municipal or county zoning ordinance the municipal or county zoning board or
commission shall certify such compliance to the Department; provided, fees
charged by such municipality or county for such permits shall not exceed the
usual charge for the services provided by such municipality or county in
connection with such permits.

§ 156.268 METHOD OF GRANTING SPECIAL PERMIT USE FOR HOT MIX ASPHALT
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS WITH OUTDOOR STORAGE FACILITY.
   (A)   Authority. The City Council may, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, grant a
special permit authorizing the use as a hot mix asphalt manufacturing and
construction facility with outdoor storage.
   (B)   Purpose. Special permit uses are those uses having some special impact
or uniqueness that require a careful review of their location, design,
configuration and special impact to determine the desirability of permitting
their establishment on any given site. They are uses that may or may not be
appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing, in each case, of
the public need and benefit against the local impact and effect.
   (C)   Parties entitled to seek special permits. An application for a special
permit may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual
interest in, the subject property.
   (D)   Standards for special permits.
      (1)   General standards. No special permit for hot mix asphalt
manufacturing and construction contractor facility with outdoor storage shall
be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant shall
establish that:
         (a)   No undue adverse impact. The proposed use, drainage and
development will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent
property, the character of the area or the public health, safety and general
welfare;
         (b)   No interference with surrounding development. The proposed use
and development will be constructed, arranged and operated so as not to
dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations;
         (c)   Adequate public facilities. The proposed use and development
will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as
streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection,
refuse disposal or the applicant will provide adequately for such services;
         (d)   No traffic congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
residential streets; and
         (e)   No destruction of significant features. The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of natural,
scenic or historic features of significant importance.
      (2)   Considerations. In determining whether the applicant’s evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the City Council shall
consider:
         (a)   Public benefit. Whether, and to what extent, the proposed use
and development at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable
to provide a service and a facility that is in the interest of the public
convenience and that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood
or community; and
         (b)   Mitigation of adverse impacts. Whether, and to what extent, all
steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed
use and development on the immediate vicinity through building design, site
design, landscaping and screening.
   (E)   Conditions on special permits. The City Council may impose such
conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this code upon the premises benefited by a special permit as may
be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other
property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon
public facilities. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the
ordinance granting the special permit. Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for
revocation of the special permit.
   (F)   Limitations on special permits.
      (1)   Subject to an extension of time granted by the City Council, no
special permit shall be valid for a period longer than two years unless a
building permit is issued and construction has actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless the use is
commenced or has already been continued within that period.
      (2)   A special permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular
use for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically expire and
cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be
discontinued for a period of 24 consecutive months or more.
   (G)   Recognition of current use.
      (1)   The property located at 16222 South Western Avenue, Markham,
Illinois, consisting of 22.2 acres is currently being used as a hot mix asphalt
manufacturing and construction contracting facility and has been used as such
since 1952. That property is deemed to fulfill all the requirements of the
special use permit as set forth in division (D)(1) above in that such use has
demonstrated:
         (a)   No adverse impact;
         (b)   No interference with surrounding development;
         (c)   Adequate public facilities;
         (d)   No residential traffic congestion; and
         (e)   No destruction of significant natural, scenic or historic
features.
      (2)   Such facility at that location is desirable to provide a local
source of hot mix asphalt products for the community. All appropriate steps
have been taken to mitigate any adverse impacts on the local area. As such, the
use satisfies the considerations set forth in division (D)(2) above. The City
Council hereby adopts a special permit for use as a hot mix asphalt
manufacturing and construction contractors facility to the property located at
16222 South Western Avenue, Markham, Illinois, without conditions or special
limitations.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

to the public as customers, patrons, clients or patients, including areas
occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display or sale of merchandise. It

provisions contained in such plan. Any use of such property in violation of
this chapter is deemed a violation of these zoning regulations. Should the
owner or occupant of any building to whom a building permit has been granted
containing off-street parking requirements so change the use to which such
building is put as to increase off-street parking as required under these

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 156.335 FINDING OF FACTS.
   It is hereby determined that, unless regulated as specified herein, the
number of signs and billboards in the city would be excessive and unduly
distracting to motorists and pedestrians, would create traffic hazards and
would reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. It is also
determined that the number of distracting signs and billboards ought to be
reduced to minimize the aforementioned effects, and that the signs and
billboards of least value to people within the city are those which carry
commercial messages other than the advertisement of any product, service,
event, person, institution, activity or business located on the lot where the
sign is located, or the sale or rental of such lot. It is also determined that
the regulations contained in this subchapter are the minimum amount of
regulation necessary to achieve its purposes.

      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest;
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities;
      (3)   A “planned development” which is a tract of land developed as a
unit under single ownership or control, includes two or more principal uses,
and is at least four acres in area, except for planned developments operated by
a municipal corporation which shall be at least two acres in area;
      (4)   Drive-in theaters;
      (5)   Uses to which a high volume of traffic, either vehicular or
pedestrian or both, are attached;
      (6)   The sale of used autos other than as allowed under C-2 zoning;
      (7)   Privately operated utilities; and
      (8)   Cannabis businesses.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the
city by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8 and 5/11-31-2. The
purpose of this chapter is: to maintain the city’s eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding
including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve
and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values
and provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific
purposes:
      (1)   To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18(g), Rivers, Lakes and
Streams Act;
      (2)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or
drainage hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion;
      (3)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
      (4)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
      (5)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities and flood rescue and
relief operations;
      (6)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property
in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
      (7)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program, codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through 79, as amended;
      (8)   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources; and
      (9)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and
riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development.
(Ord. 08-O-1929, passed 8-6-2008)
§ 157.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A non-habitable structure which is on the same parcel
of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
   ACT. An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams
of the state, 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
   APPROPRIATE USE. Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible
and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed
are as specified in §
157.21(C) of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR FREQUENCY FLOOD EVENT.
Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in §
157.05 of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of the building having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, including manufactured homes,
prefabricated buildings and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than 180
days per year.
   CHANNEL. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash or natural or human-made drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION. Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION includes
damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of CHANNEL MODIFICATION involving a significant change in the channel cross-
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off-site flood water elevations and flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE. Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this part, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as- built plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood
boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective Flood Hazard Boundary Map or
Flood Insurance Rate Map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these CRITICAL FACILITIES can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community or can put
special populations at risk. Examples of CRITICAL FACILITIES where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations); schools; hospitals; retirement homes and senior care
facilities; major roads and bridges; critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers); and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of CRITICAL FACILITIES where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants; water treatment plants; and pumping stations.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. DAMS may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
   DESIGNATED FLOODWAY.
      (1)   The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the
floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on the FEMA
FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year frequency
flood discharge with no more than a 0.1-foot increase in stage due to the loss
of flood conveyance or storage and no more than a 10% increase in velocities.
      (2)   The floodways are designated for Park Creek, I-57 Drainage Ditch,
Bel Aire Creek, Dixie Creek and Calumet Union Drainage Ditch, Southern Branch

restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
      (3)   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that
are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city that may be annexed
into the city are designated for the Calumet Union Drainage Ditch on the
countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA and dated 8-19-2008.
      (4)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the DESIGNATED
FLOODWAY boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to real estate, including:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, repair or placement of a building
or any addition to a building;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a

   The following are duties of the Director of Building and Housing:
   (A)   Determining the floodplain designation.
      (1)   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA);
      (2)   If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile; and
      (3)   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended
SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the
development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance or
inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to
delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections
of this chapter.
   (B)   Professional engineer review.
      (1)   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer
under the employ or contract of the city for review to ensure that the
development meets §§
157.21 and
157.22 of this chapter.
      (2)   In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing
that the development meets the requirements of §
157.21 of this chapter.
   (C)   Dam safety requirements.
      (1)   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage
potential in the event of failure.
      (2)   The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard)
and Class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
      (3)   Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins that
have an embankment are non-jurisdictional Class III dam. It is not required

Rate Map of the county shall be according to the best existing data available
from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an
engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood
elevations.
      (1)   When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists,
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall
be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS or a dynamic
model such as HIP.
      (2)   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-l, TR-20 or HIP, or by techniques

or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
         (a)   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The Director of Building and Housing shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
      (4)   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall
be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and re-vegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
      (5)   The Director of Building and Housing shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity.
The Director of Building and Housing shall not issue a permit unless all other
federal, state and local permits have been obtained.
   (C)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      (1)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data
and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of
removing the site from the floodplain.
      (2)   (a)   1.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for
use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or
structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be
compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation
taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
            2.   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-
half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
            3.   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall
be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
            4.   All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
            5.   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
         (b)   Compensatory storage shall be provided incrementally as follows:
            1.   All regulatory floodplain storage lost below the existing
regulatory ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed
regulatory ten-year flood elevation;
            2.   All regulatory floodplain storage lost above the existing
regulatory ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
regulatory ten-year flood elevation; and
            3.   The additional compensatory storage required beyond a one to
one (1:1) ratio may be placed above or below the proposed regulatory ten-year
flood elevation.
   (D)   Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE).
A person who has obtained a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill that removes a
site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate
the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the city to construct the
lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The
Director of Building and Housing shall not issue such a permit unless the
applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following
subsection.
      (1)   Compensatory storage shall be provided per division (C)(2) above.
      (2)   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
      (3)   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above
the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the Director of Building and Housing may waive the ten-foot minimum
setback if a state licensed professional engineer certify that an alternative
method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has
been met, The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and
structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the Director of
Building and Housing for review. The Director of Building and Housing may
require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed
shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case
shall the setback distance be less than four feet.
      (4)   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if
site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the Director
of Building and Housing may waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance if a
state licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to
protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A
detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback
distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding shall be
submitted to the city for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less
than four feet.
      (5)   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this division (D) and is at least five feet thick under the
basement floor slab. Nothing in this division (D) shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes,
      (6)   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material and the engineering priorities must be in the
same direction.
      (7)   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by a state licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the site
conditions.
      (8)   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five below the BFE.
      (9)   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab,
and minimum of one-quarter horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times
the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the
building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor
under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      (10)   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      (11)   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
      (12)   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in the preceding paragraphs of this division (D), the Director of
Building and Housing may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE
only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet
the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and
are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed
structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a
detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The
engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest
edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being
prepared by a state licensed professional engineer.
      (13)   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The
rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if
necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly
to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain
the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

         (b)   A licensed professional engineer, under the employ or contract
of the city shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section.
   (C)   Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses.
      (1)   The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or
impair fee natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or
channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm.
Code part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
         (a)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
         (b)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water-dependent uses;
         (c)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
         (d)   Underground and overhead utilities;
         (e)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems, including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including
open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that will not
block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         (f)   Detached garages, storage sheds or other non-habitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         (g)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
         (h)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            1.   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event
will not exceed one foot; or
            2.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility
parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during over bank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all over
bank flooding events.
         (i)   Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a
positive non-erosive slop toward a watercourse;
         (j)   Flood-proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of water-tight window wells, elevating
structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure,
and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
         (k)   The replacement, reconstruction or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the
building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation; and
         (l)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase
the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios and second story additions. If the
building is improved to 50% or more of the market value before the modification
occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from
flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      (2)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of
any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation
or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in
the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials, except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
      (3)   Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate
use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets
the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing
with supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional
engineer and provided mat any structure meets the protection requirements of §
157.23 of this chapter:
         (a)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            1.   Designated floodway conveyance, “K” = (1.486/n)(AR2/3), where
“n” is Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and “R” is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959));
            2.   The same Manning’s V value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover; and
            3.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length;
               b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length;
               c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used;
               d.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties; and
               e.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         (b)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding.
            1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            2.   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
at least one and one-half Awes the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            3.   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
            4.   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
            5.   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            6.   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at existing structure.
         (c)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights.
            1.   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
            2.   In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by me use of rip-rap or other design measures.
         (d)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches.
            1.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will he contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements.
            2.   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than one-tenth feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to
obtain a permit for a dam or waiver.
               a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
157.05 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any
commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
               b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per division
(C)(3) above.
               c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division (C)(3)
above.
               d.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is
used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be
received.
               e.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
division (C).
               f.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed per division (C)(3) above.
         (e)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and
approach roads.
            1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
            2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            3.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         (f)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water.
            1.   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero feet
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within
recorded flood easements.
            2.   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            3.   All dams and impoundment structures, as defined in §
157.02 of this chapter, shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm.
Code part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity
involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
               a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation or regional storm water
detention;
               b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation
basin;
               d.   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; and
               e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
this section.
         (g)   Flood-proofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures.
            1.   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of
the existing building, the outside perimeter of the flood-proofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
            2.   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be
required for flood-proofing activities.
         (h)   Excavation in the floodway.
            1.   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation,
            2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length;
               b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length;
               c.   When expanding or contacting flows in a vertical direction,
a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used; and
               d.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         (i)   Channel modification. If the proposed activity involves a
channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
            1.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, flood-proofing of existing structures, removal of structures
from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel or the
establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification
is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water
quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
            2.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
            3.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria.
               a.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
               b.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they
will prevent erosion.
               c.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
               d.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
               e.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
               f.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               g.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features
shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
               h.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               i.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
               j.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               k.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of flood water storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
            4.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         (j)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
         (k)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria.
            1.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the
initiation of improvements.
            2.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade, but
will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.
            3.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches
and sediment traps and basins.
            4.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see
division (C)(3)(p) below). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be
minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to
minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be
restabilized immediately.
            5.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (1988), also known as the
“Green Book”, and The Illinois Urban Manual (NRCS, J995).
         (l)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control
projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if
the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         (m)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
            1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §
157.05 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
            2.   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               a.   The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency
flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               b.   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
            3.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         (n)   Conditional letter of map revision.
            1.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
            2.   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
            3.   In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            4.   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
            5.   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         (o)   Professional engineer’s supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional
engineer.
         (p)   Construction. For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be
met.
            1.   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            2.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         (q)   Conditional approval. After receipt of conditional approval of
the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway
designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction
that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated
floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The
designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the “as-built” plans.
      (4)   Development activities in delegated communities requiring state
review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or

§ 158.001 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired, and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license, or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license, or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the city so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city
to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety,
and welfare.

§ 158.005 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Superintendent
of Public Works, or his or her designee, within a reasonable time after filing.
If the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Superintendent of Public
Works, or his or her designee, shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Superintendent of Public Works, or his or
her designee, is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements
of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations,
the Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her designee, shall issue a
permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty
of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of
Public Works, or his or her designee, that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to commence
work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work
requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of
work requiring excavation. The Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her
designee, shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility
may be placed, used, and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her
designee, fails to provide such specification of location to the
telecommunications retailer within either: (i) ten days after service of notice
to the city by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not
involving excavation for new construction; or (ii) 25 days after service of
notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving
excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence
work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
158.004 the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications, and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of division (A) of this section.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the city, unless otherwise acted upon by the city, provided the
holder has complied with applicable city codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Ord. 21-O-2302, passed 6-2-2021)
§ 158.006 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 21-O-2302, passed 6-2-2021) Penalty, see §
158.999
§ 158.007 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with this chapter. If the city denies the
request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility
from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit
and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
(Ord. 21-O-2302, passed 6-2-2021)
§ 158.008 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. 
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the city, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A) and (B) of this section:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability.
         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
         "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after
receipt by the City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the City Mayor or Administrator of
such intent to cancel or not to renew."
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C), and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under
the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
[All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.]

be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 21-O-2302, passed 6-2-2021)
§ 158.010 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the City Engineer and/or Director of Public Works, and
may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
of Public Works, or his or her designee, may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall
be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this division (C) for any
single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14 day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs, or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee
shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this
section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

      (4)   The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time periods provided in this division (C).
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of this
section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: (i) correct the deficiencies; (ii)
upon not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or (iii) after not less than 30 days notice to the
permittee of failure to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and

§ 158.012 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the city no less than
30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way
or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or the
facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former
owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and facilities in
the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or

§ 158.015 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this section.
      (1)   No interference with city facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her
designee, determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or
displacement of any of the City's utility facilities or will otherwise
interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the city's utility
facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.

provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The city may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The city may
require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The city may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The city may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The city may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular
locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.

as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Engineer and/or Director of Public Works.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the city.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   1.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement
shall be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the city.
            2.   Bell and spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of
installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the city as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities; tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire, or other means.

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades, or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her designee, or his or her duly
authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have
been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to
make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to
interfere with the free movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified
immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.

§ 158.021 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the Superintendent
of Public Works, or his or her designee, as a part of the permit application.
The request shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance
is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Superintendent of Public Works, or
his or her designee, shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each
provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on an individual
basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Superintendent of Public
Works, or his or her designee, may authorize a variance only if the utility
requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations, or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her
designee, may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable
standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this
chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision, or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the
Superintendent of Public Works, or his or her designee, under the provisions of
this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the City Council, or such other
board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the City Clerk within 30 days after the date of such
order, requirement, decision, or determination. The City Council shall commence
its consideration of the appeal at the Council's next regularly scheduled
meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The City
Council shall timely decide the appeal.

§ 158.999 PENALTIES.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when
the city will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because
the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
city's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility
that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
