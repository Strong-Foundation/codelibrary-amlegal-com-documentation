means is approved may not vote on the approval of any other member's request
considered during that meeting, but may participate in any debate on the
question.
         h.   Any member whose request for attendance by electronic means is
denied may continue to listen to and/or view the meeting via electronic means,
but may only participate to the same extent in which a member of the public
physically present at the meeting could participate.
      5.   Closed Sessions:
         a.   Any member's request to attend by electronic means only the
closed session of any such meeting shall be considered and voted upon in open

purpose of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision and order. Nothing in
this section shall prevent the village from consolidating multiple findings,

accordance with the applicable municipal ordinance. Service of the summons and

of the code of civil procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested,
provided that the total amount of fines, other sanctions, and costs imposed by

hearing department and a docket number shall be stamped on all copies of the
report and a hearing date shall be noted on the form. The hearing date shall

on the owner cannot be made by mail, service may be made on the owner by
posting or nailing a copy of the violation report form on the front door of the
structure where the violation is found, not less than twenty (20) days before
the hearing is scheduled 3 .

fact exist, or at the time of the hearing, the violation has been remedied or
removed;
         b.   The building code violation has been caused by the current
property occupants and that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to
maintain the dwelling free of such violations, the current occupants continue
to cause the violations;
         c.   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the
owner or his agent to all or part of the dwelling for the purpose of correcting

produced by the device while it was under his/her control. The original or a

administrator, and there shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of
business. A parking, standing, or compliance violation notice issued, signed
and served in accordance with this section, or a copy of the notice, shall be

facts shown on the notice. The notice or copy shall be admissible in any

for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated;
            (8)   State that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of
violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to
exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any unpaid
fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the village of Antioch.
         b.   A notice of final determination of parking, standing, or
compliance violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final

            (3)   State that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an
original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self- addressed,

petition are limited to: a) the person not having been the owner or lessee of
the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, b) the person
having already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question and c)
excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. After the
determination of violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just
cause, the person owing the unpaid fine or penalty shall be provided with a
hearing on the merits for the violation 10 .

setting of a hearing for the eligibility to receive said benefits.
      4.   The claim shall be submitted within sixty (60) days of the date the
disability pension has been awarded by the pension board.
   E.   Authorization. Any applicant for PSEBA benefits must execute a signed

provided by law.
      7.   Expedited Hearing. The hearing procedures set forth in this Code may
be expedited by the Village in instances where the eligibility for benefits is
obvious and without doubt.
   H.   Eligibility for Paid Health Insurance Premiums
      1.   Basic Group Health Plan. An applicant that has been approved for
eligibility for PSEBA benefits (the "PSEBA beneficiary") will be enrolled in
the Village's identified basic health group plan. The basic group health plan
will be determined annually at the start of the benefit open enrollment period.
If the PSEBA beneficiary chooses to enroll in any other group health plan
offered by the Village of Antioch, the PSEBA beneficiary must pay the
difference in insurance premiums. The basic group health insurance plan does
not include any supplemental coverage such as dental, vision or life insurance,
nor does it cover the cost of any co-pays or deductibles.
      2.   Other Benefits. Health insurance benefits payable from any other
source will reduce the benefits payable from the Village. Each PSEBA
beneficiary shall sign an affidavit attesting that the PSEBA beneficiary, his
or her spouse, and eligible dependents are not eligible for insurance benefits
from any other source. When and if the PSEBA beneficiary, his or her spouse, or
eligible dependents are eligible for benefits from another source, the PSEBA
beneficiary shall notify the Village of that other source no later than five
(5) business days from the other coverage taking effect.
      3.   Disclosure of Health Insurance Coverage. The PSEBA beneficiary has
an on-going obligation and shall update health insurance coverage information
provided and failure to do so may result in the denial of benefits and/or
reimbursement to the Village for duplicate coverage. If duplicate coverage has
been received by a PSEBA beneficiary, further PSEBA benefits may be denied
until the Village has been fully reimbursed by the PSEBA beneficiary for
benefits that would not have been paid due to the other health coverage.
      4.   Reimbursement. Receipt of health insurance benefits from other
sources without notice to the Village shall require the PSEBA beneficiary to
reimburse the Village for the value of those benefits.
      5.   Medicare Eligibility. The PSEBA beneficiary shall notify the Village
when he or she becomes Medicare eligible regardless of the status of the
enrollment period, so the Village may assist with the transition to Medicare
coverage and/or adjust health insurance benefits or PSEBA benefits accordingly.

percent (9%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.

the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed, and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.
   C.   Abatement: The local tax administrator shall have the authority to
waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file
penalty if the local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists

1-9-11: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the

administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 01-02-11, 2-5-2001)

the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.

years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due, or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 01-02-11, 2-5-2001)
1-9-13: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 01-02-11, 2-5-
2001)
1-9-14: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCE:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Upon request, copies of
all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public at the village clerk's
office. (Ord. 01-02-11, 2-5-2001)
1-9-15: LIENS FOR UNPAID TAXES:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord. 01-

1-11-1: POLICY AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsive to the people
they serve; government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of
the governmental structure; public office not be used for personal gain or to
advance the interests of family or relatives; and the public have confidence in
the integrity of its government. In recognition of such goals, there is
established a code of ethics for all village public officials, whether elected
or appointed, paid or unpaid, and for village employees. The purposes of this
code of ethics are to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such
public officials and public employees by setting forth the acts or actions
which are incompatible with the best interests of the village and its
inhabitants and by requiring disclosure by public officials and public
employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the
village.
   B.   This code of ethics is founded upon the principle that no individual
shall receive any impermissible financial or other gain by reason of their
serving as a public official or public employee of the village, and that no
private person or taxpayer, including public officials or public employees, or
their family members, should receive any benefits from village action beyond
that which is available to any other private person or taxpayer due to their
relation to or as a result of privileged information or support provided by any
public official or public employee.
   C.   It is the legislative intent of the corporate authorities for this
chapter to be liberally construed to accomplish the policy and purposes herein
expressed to the greatest extent permitted by law. (Ord. 09-04-10, 4-20-2009)
1-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this code of ethics, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
BUSINESS ENTITY: Any business, proprietorship, firm, partnership, person in a
representative or fiduciary capacity, association, venture, trust or

   B.   If the public official, employee or family member fails or refuses to
disclose his interest in any real property within a TIF project area or
otherwise violates any of the provisions of this section, the public official
or employee shall be subject to penalties and sanctions as otherwise provided
under this code of ethics or the village code, as may be applicable. (Ord. 09-
04-10, 4-20-2009)
1-11-21: FAILURE TO ATTEND MEETINGS; FINE:
   A.   In the event of there being less than a quorum at any regular meeting
of the village board of trustees, the members of the corporate authorities
present may have served a summons on any absent members, such summons being
served by any police officer of the village, and may demand the immediate
presence of such member at the meeting if he is able to attend. Any member who
shall ignore such a notice, or who shall wilfully fail to attend any regular or
special meeting of the village board without good cause, may be fined an amount
equal to one-twenty fourth (1/24) of such officer's annual salary, on a
majority vote of all of the trustees elected to office.
   B.   Any member of the corporate authorities who fails to attend eighteen
(18) regular or special meetings of the village board during any fiscal year,
without good cause, may, after a due process hearing before the village board,
be fined an amount equal to one-twenty fourth (1/24) of such officer's annual
salary on a majority vote of all of the trustees elected to office. Each
subsequent unexcused absence after the seventh absence shall be considered a
separate and additional violation of this provision for which an additional
fine may be assessed.
   C.   Participation in any regular or special meeting by electronic means
shall not be considered an absence for the purposes of this section. (Ord. 09-
04-10, 4-20-2009)
1-11-22: HIRING OF RELATIVES/NEPOTISM:
   A.   The employment of relatives in the same division or department of an
organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and
employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work,
personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day to
day working relationships. The village is committed to monitoring situations in
which family members work in the same division or department. In case of actual
or potential problems, the village will take prompt action. This can include
reassignment or, if necessary, termination of employment for one or both of the
individuals involved.
   B.   An individual shall not occupy a position where he or she reports to or
is supervised by his or her family member. This constitutes a "prohibited
employee relationship".
   C.   Family members of elected or appointed village officials shall not
become employed in any capacity with the village after the commencement of the
elected or appointed official's term. This provision is not intended to require
any action to address an existing employment relationship which began prior to
an elected or appointed official first beginning to serve.
   D.   Family members of department directors and the village administrator
shall not be employed in any capacity with the village.
   E.   The provisions of this policy shall not apply to any full time or
regular part time employee of the village hired before the effective date of
this revised policy. (Ord. 09-04-10, 4-20-2009)
1-11-23: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this code of ethics or application thereof to any person or
circumstance is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
does not affect other provisions or applications of this code of ethics which
can be given effect without the invalid application or provisions, and, to this
end, each such invalid provision or invalid application of this code of ethics
is severable, unless otherwise provided by this code. It is hereby declared to
be the legislative intent of the village that this code of ethics would have
been adopted had any such unconstitutional or otherwise invalid provision or
application not been included. (Ord. 09-04-10, 4-20-2009)
1-11-24: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:

1-11-10 of this chapter, or subsection C of this section, after a due process
hearing before the village board, may be subject to discipline, or removal from
office as otherwise may be authorized by law.
   F.   In addition to any other penalty that may be applicable hereunder, a
public employee who is found guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction of
violating any provision of section
1-11-5 or
1-11-10 of this chapter, or subsection C of this section may be subject to
discipline and/or dismissal as may otherwise be determined by the village
administrator.
   G.   The penalties provided in subsections A through F of this section are
not exclusive and are in addition to any other regulations relating to public
official or public employee sanctions or disciplinary procedures as may
otherwise be authorized in the village code or Illinois municipal code for
violation of this code of ethics or analogous statutory provisions. (Ord. 09-

The regulations of Public Act 100-0554 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act" in
this chapter), are hereby adopted by reference and made applicable to the
elected officials, officers and employees of the Village to the extent required
by the Act. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-2: POLICY ADOPTED:
As required by the Act, the following policy provisions set forth in this
chapter are hereby adopted, and are expressly applicable to all elected
officials, officers and employees of the Village. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-3: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Antioch to prohibit harassment
of any person by any Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or
Municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All Municipal
officials, Municipal agents, Municipal employees and Municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-4: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
This chapter adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   A.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment,
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
necessarily limited to:
      1.   Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      2.   Non-Verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/Electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some forms of sexual harassment are subtler
and depend, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person". The Village administration, in enforcing this chapter will
utilize that same standard. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-5: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
However, persons wishing to make a report of sexual harassment and who are
uncomfortable with reporting it within the ordinary chain of command may (for
this sole purpose) ignore the chain of command and make the report with any
supervisory person described in this section, and may do so anonymously. This
provision is specifically intended to include, but is not limited to, instances
where the alleged harasser holds a supervisory position over the reporting
person.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following:
   A.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing behavior
in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express
her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending
behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are
needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
   B.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
Director of Human Resources, an Ethics Officer, the Village Administrator, or
the Mayor.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must
not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses
and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
   C.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this chapter is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all Municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the Municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-6: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or Municipal
agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any Municipal
employee due to a Municipal employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
chapter,
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this chapter, or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   B.   For the purposes of this chapter, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a Municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act 1  provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2 , an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other
proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation 3 .
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4 , it is a civil rights
violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate
against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in
good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge - due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-
2017)

1-12-7: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this chapter or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an Ethics Commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a State or Federal agency. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-8: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this chapter shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an Ethics Commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-9: EXISTING ORDINANCES OR POLICIES:
This chapter shall be deemed to supersede any and all existing ordinances or
policies which regulate the conduct of Village elected officials, officers or
employees, but only to the extent of the regulations set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-10: FUTURE AMENDMENTS:
Any amendment to the Act that becomes effective after the effective date of
this chapter shall be incorporated into this chapter by reference and shall be
applicable to the regulated activities. However, any amendment that makes its
provisions optional for adoption by municipalities shall not be incorporated
into this chapter by reference without formal action by the Corporate
Authorities of the Village. (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-11: FUTURE ACTS DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL:
   A.   If the Illinois Supreme Court declares the Act unconstitutional in its
entirety, then this chapter shall be repealed as of the date that the Illinois
Supreme Court's decision becomes final and not subject to any further appeals
or rehearings. This chapter shall be deemed repealed without further action by
the Corporate Authorities of the Village if the Act is found unconstitutional
by the Illinois Supreme Court.
   B.   If the Illinois Supreme Court declares part of the Act unconstitutional
but upholds the constitutionality of the remainder of the Act, or does not
address the remainder of the Act, then the remainder of the Act as adopted by
this chapter shall remain in full force and effect; however, that part of this
chapter relating to the part of the Act found unconstitutional shall be deemed
repealed without further action by the Corporate Authorities of the Village.
(Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-2017)
1-12-12: PENALTY:
Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter for which no
other penalty is specified shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00)
nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). (Ord. 17-12-48, 12-11-

   A.   It is the intent of the Village Board and declared to be the policy of
the Village that every effort shall be made to provide funds for disaster
emergencies.
   B.   It is the Village Board's intent that the first recourse shall be to
funds regularly appropriated to the Village's emergency funds. If the Village
Mayor finds that the demands placed upon these funds in coping with a
particular disaster are unreasonably great, and the Governor has proclaimed the
Village a disaster, the Village Mayor may make application for funds from the
State Disaster Relief Fund. If the monies from all available previously
appropriated emergency funds are insufficient, and the Village Mayor finds that
other sources of money to cope with the disaster are not available or are
insufficient, the Village Mayor may issue a call for an immediate session of
the Village Board for the purpose of enacting ordinances as the Board may deem
necessary to transfer and expend monies appropriated for other purposes, to
borrow monies from the United States government or other public or private
sources. If less than a quorum of the members of the Board is capable of
convening in session to enact such ordinances for the transfer, expenditure or
loan of such monies, the Village Mayor is authorized to carry out those
decisions until such time as a quorum of the Board can convene.
   C.   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the
Village Mayor's authority to apply for, administer and expend grants, gifts, or
payments in aid of disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response or
recovery.

authorize any purchase or contracts necessary to place the Village in a
position to combat effectively any disaster resulting from the explosion of any
nuclear or other bomb or missile, and to protect the public health and safety,
protect property, and provide emergency assistance to victims in the case of
such disaster, or from manmade or natural disaster.
   E.   In the event of enemy caused or other disaster, the Village
Administrator is authorized, on behalf of the Village, to procure such
services, supplies, equipment, or material as may be necessary for such
purposes, in view of the exigency, without regard to the statutory procedures
or formalities normally prescribed by law pertaining to Village contracts or
obligations, as authorized by 20 Illinois Compiled Statutes. However, if the
Mayor meets with the Board of Trustees at this time, he shall act subject to
the directions and restrictions imposed by that body. (Ord. 19-03-08, 3-11-
2019)
2-8-6: LOCAL DISASTERS:

(7) days except by or with the consent of the Village Board. Any order or
proclamation declaring, continuing or terminating a local disaster shall be
given prompt and general publicity, and shall be filed promptly with the
Village Clerk.
   B.   The effect of a declaration of a local disaster is to activate the
response and recovery aspects of any and all applicable local emergency
operations plans and to authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance
thereunder.
   C.   During a local disaster, the Village Mayor may suspend the provisions
of any Village ordinance prescribing procedures for the conduct of Village
business, or the orders, rules and regulations of any Village agency, if strict
compliance with the provisions of any ordinance, rule or regulation would in
any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency,
as authorized by "the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act", provided that,
if the Village Board meets at such time, the Village Mayor shall act subject to
the directions and restrictions imposed by the body. (Ord. 19-03-08, 3-11-2019)
2-8-7: STATE EMERGENCY ACTION:
If the Governor proclaims that a disaster emergency exists in the event of
actual enemy attack upon the United States or the occurrence within the State
of Illinois of a major disaster resulting from enemy sabotage or other hostile
action, or from manmade or natural disaster, it shall be the duty of the
Village of Antioch to cooperate fully with the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency and with the Governor in the exercise of emergency powers as provided by
law. (Ord. 19-03-08, 3-11-2019)
2-8-8: TESTING OF WARNING DEVICES:

be held only on the first Tuesday of each month at ten o'clock (10:00) A.M.
(Ord. 19-03-08, 3-11-2019)
2-8-9: MUTUAL AID ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS:
The Village of Antioch may, in collaboration with other public agencies within
the immediate vicinity, develop or cause to be developed mutual aid
arrangements with other political subdivisions, municipal corporations or
bodies politic within this State for reciprocal disaster response and recovery
in case a disaster is too great to be dealt with unassisted. The mutual aid
shall not, however, be effective unless and until approved by each of such
political subdivisions, municipal corporations or bodies of politic as are

connected by the interoffice channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include
any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made

sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or

taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonable identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services of telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or

retailer of the telecommunications.
INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate or

imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for

SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.

acts or privileges:
   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event,
shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by
this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in
the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation
of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any
taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or
municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any
tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the
amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax
properly due and paid in another municipality in this state which was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this
state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 09-11-34, 11-16-2009)
3-2-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 09-11-34, 11-16-2009)

act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any accompanying rules and
regulations created by the department to implement the act. (Ord. 09-11-34, 11-
16-2009)
3-2-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number
from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection
with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable
because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 09-11-34, 11-16-2009)

wireless provider shall provide legally competent written evidence of the
consent of the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      2.   Application Process: The Village shall process applications as
follows:
         a.   Application Priority: The first completed application shall have
priority over applications received by different applicants for collocation on
the same utility pole or wireless support structure.
         b.   Application Processing: An application to collocate a small
wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or
replacement of an existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be
processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the

deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing of its
intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than seventy five (75)
days following the submission of a completed application.
The permit shall be deemed approved on the 90th day after submission of the

preclude the Village's denial of the permit application within the time limits
as provided under this chapter.
         d.   Application Denial: The Village shall deny an application which
does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
If the Village determines that applicable codes, ordinances, or regulations
that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and conditions

replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of
the provider.
The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific Code
provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the
documentation to the applicant concurrent with the notice of application

The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted
with the revised application.
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited
in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the cure
requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.

applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment
Agreement.
      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:

wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent

      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's

determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair, and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition
and good repair, and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents, or

interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Electric Distribution Or Transmission System: The wireless provider
shall not collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are
part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Public Safety: The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.

design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits, or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms, and
conditions set forth in the Village of Antioch zoning ordinance.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning, or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty

ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable, and
applications not accompanied by the fee shall be deemed incomplete.
      4.   The Village shall not require an application, approval, or permit,
or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights- of-way, for:
         a.   Routine maintenance;
         b.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless

lane closures.
   E.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately-owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: a) to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this chapter.
   F.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after
the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent
to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   G.   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells or
transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider.
   H.   Indemnification: A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the
Village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or
property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use
or occupancy of the Village improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the
Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall
further waive any claims that they may have against the Village with respect to
consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the
theory of liability.
   I.   Insurance: The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless
provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance:
      1.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      2.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      3.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to
the collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self- insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage limits required by the Village. (Ord. 18-07-29, 7-9-2018)

      3.   Limited Exception For Subsequent Protected Uses And Residential
Property: An adult use lawfully operating under this chapter and under the

establishment at a time when an application for an adult use license, under the
adult use establishment licensing provisions of the village for that
establishment is submitted after the license has previously expired, has been
revoked or is at that time under suspension. (Ord. 00-12-20, 12-4-2000)

established a 50/50 grant program for the purposes of development and
redevelopment within certain designated areas of the village of Antioch. (Ord.
06-06-22, 6-19-2006)
4-11-2: PURPOSE:
In order to stimulate visual and aesthetic interest in, and renewed and
enhanced economic vitality in the qualifying business areas, the purpose of
this chapter is to provide economic incentives to business property owners of
qualifying properties within qualifying zoning districts for building facade
upgrades and redesigns provided such facade upgrades and redesigns comply with
the standards provided herein and comply with the provisions of any other
applicable ordinances and regulations of the village. (Ord. 06-06-22, 6-19-
2006)
4-11-3: DESIGNATION OF QUALIFYING ZONING DISTRICTS:
To qualify for the facade improvement program (the "program") established by

assistance under the program must be shown to be clearly within zoning
districts B-1, B-2, B-3, or the downtown overlay district within the
territorial limits of the village of Antioch, Illinois. (Ord. 07-02-04, 2-20-
2007)
4-11-4: CREATION OF FACADE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM:
As part of a business area development, rehabilitation and enhancement plan,
there is hereby created a facade improvement program to be implemented within
the qualifying zoning districts. The facade improvement program shall operate
as follows:
   A.   General Intent: Approved property owners who install at least one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in value and actual cost of qualifying
improvements to facades and storefronts are eligible to apply to the village
for a cost sharing grant equal to fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the work,
up to a maximum grant of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per storefront or
interior, per fiscal year. The village shall verify and determine the value and
the cost of such improvements based upon credible evidence thereof submitted by
the applicant. Only the actual cost paid for such improvements, and not the
value thereof, shall be eligible for cost sharing under this chapter. Provided,
however, where actual costs paid for the qualifying improvements are less than
the value of those improvements (as such value is determined by the village)
only the actual eligible cost paid shall be eligible for the grant cost share
reimbursement.
   B.   Eligible Improvements: Eligible improvements include brick cleaning and
tuck pointing; painting; awnings; sign replacement or repair (but only under
circumstances where it is determined by the village that the proposed signage
is a significant contribution to the overall architecture of the building);
window display area remodeling; exterior lighting; replacement of windows or
doors; restoration of original architectural features; and other improvements
which are visible from the street and which have a positive impact on the
appearance of the building. Interior restoration would include tin ceiling
restoration or restoration of original woodwork or architectural features.
Other interior eligible expenses include life safety devices and handicap
washroom upgrades. (Ord. 07-02-04, 2-20-2007)
   C.   Ineligible Improvements: Improvements which are ineligible for grants
under the facade improvement program include new construction; interior
remodeling (except the improvements listed above); purchase of furnishings,
equipment or other personal property which does not become part of the real
estate; and improvements completed or expenses incurred prior to notification
of approval.
   D.   Criteria For Grant Eligibility: The criteria used to determine
eligibility for grants under the facade improvement program are as follows:
      1.   The compatibility of the proposed improvements with the overall
architectural design goals for the area;
      2.   Compliance with village building codes, zoning and sign regulations
and the comprehensive plan;
      3.   The relationship between the proposed improvements and the general
character of the streetscape and other buildings in the area;
      4.   The overall impact of the improvements on the appearance,
marketability and life safety features of the building;
      5.   The relationship between the improvements and the original
architecture or historic significances of the building or area;
      6.   Any financing, in conjunction with a project where village of
Antioch facade improvement funds are used, must be funded through a financial
institution within the village limits.
Eligibility shall be evaluated on a first come, first served basis.
   E.   Procedure: Forms for grant applications shall be available at the
department of community services. The procedure for evaluation of applications
shall be as follows:
      1.   Completed applications (5 copies) shall be filed with the department
of community services. Applications shall not be deemed to be complete unless
accompanied by a preliminary design sketch, a description of needed work items,
cost estimates from contractors and a signed agreement with the village. The
estimates are preferred to be from local (Antioch, Antioch township or Antioch
chamber of commerce members) contractors unless such services are not
available. A minimum of two (2) estimates are required. If local contractors
are not competitive other estimates will be accepted. The agreement required
under this subsection E1 shall: a) be on a form provided by the office of the
village clerk, b) incorporate the relevant provisions of this chapter, and c)
provide that the applicant agrees that the village is not in any way a
contractor, owner or operator for the project and further agreeing to indemnify
and hold the village harmless from any and all claims, suits, demands and
judgments pertaining to, and arising out of the work which is the subject of
the application.
      2.   Within seven (7) days after receipt of a completed application, the
director of department of community services, accompanied by the director of
planning and zoning or his designee, shall meet with the applicant to review
the application. At the conclusion of said meeting (or continued meeting date
if application is deemed incomplete), the director of department of community
services shall determine whether the application is eligible for processing.
The application may be amended on its face to meet concerns or suggestions of
the department of community services. Written reasons for denial shall be
provided to applicant within seven (7) days after meeting.
      3.   If the department of community services finds the applicant to be
ineligible for a grant, the applicant may appeal to the village board. Appeals
to the village board must be in writing, state with specificity the reason(s)
supporting the applicant's appeal and be filed with the office of the village
clerk within fourteen (14) days of applicant's receipt of the notice of
ineligibility.
      4.   The eligible application will then be presented to the chairman of
the redevelopment commission within seven (7) days of the receipt of the
completed application. The chairman's recommendation shall be forwarded to the
finance, economic and redevelopment committee of the village board for further
recommendation to the village board of trustees. The chairman of the
redevelopment commission shall report his findings to the full redevelopment
commission at their next regularly scheduled meeting.
      5.   The village board shall consider the application at its next meeting
on which the application can be placed on the agenda and shall either vote to
find the application eligible, find the application ineligible, or request
further information from either the applicant or appropriate village staff. If
further information is needed and provided, the village board shall take up the
application at its next available regular village board meeting and vote
promptly after receipt and review thereof, and the decision of the village
board shall be final. Nothing herein shall prevent the applicant from
withdrawing the application prior to a decision by the village board.
      6.   Copies of all bids, contracts, invoices, contractor statements and
lien waivers shall be submitted to the department of community services but
neither the community development director nor the village shall have any
liability to any party for review or evaluation of any such documents. The
documents submitted shall become public records of the village.
      7.   Applicant is responsible for obtaining such building permits and/or
zoning approvals as are necessary for any improvements.
      8.   Any changes to approved plans or drawings must be approved by the
department of community services prior to being made. Changes to the previously
submitted plans without prior approval of the changes shall render the project
"nonqualifying".
      9.   Upon a finding of eligibility by the village board of trustees, the
applicant may proceed with the project in accordance with the procedures and
regulations consistent with all applicable village codes, the provisions of
this chapter, and such procedures and regulations as are established by the
office of the village administrator which are not inconsistent with the
provisions of this chapter.
      10.   Following completion of the work, the village building department
will inspect the work for conformance with the approved plans and drawings and
compliance with village codes.
      11.   Upon final inspection approval from the building department,
applicant may apply to the village for a cost share reimbursement for up to
fifty percent (50%) of the project cost up to a maximum limit of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.00). No legal, architectural or engineering fees shall qualify
for, or be included, in the project costs for program cost sharing purposes. No
amounts shall be approved for payment in excess of the village's portion of the
preliminary cost estimate submitted with the application, and no check shall be
issued by the village unless the applicant and contractor have acknowledged and
certified in writing, under oath, that the work is complete, applicant has paid
applicant's portion of the cost of the work and final waivers of all mechanic's
and material man's liens are delivered to the village for all labor and
materials supplied to complete the work. If the project is not completed within
twelve (12) months of the village board of trustees approval date, the project
grant eligibility will expire. (Ord. 06-06-22, 6-19-2006)
4-11-5: FUNDING:

disbursed. When grant applications have been approved totaling the approximate
appropriated or budgeted amount for any fiscal period, then no further
applications shall be received until the beginning of the next fiscal period,
and any applications which at that time have not been approved, may proceed
through the approval process but the applicant shall be notified that funding
may not occur until the following fiscal period. Any applications which have
been approved but so deferred shall be at the top of the list for funding in

board, such amendment, alteration, modification or repeal shall terminate all
then pending applications without recourse or liability to the village, its

apply only to costs incurred for activities performed on abandoned residential
properties under this section, as permitted by state law, and is an alternative

abatement activity pursuant to this section on more than one (1) occasion
during the course of one (1) year, then the village may combine any or all of
the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien.
The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth: (i) a
description of the abandoned residential property that sufficiently describes
the parcel; (ii) the amount of the cost incurred or payable for the activities;
(iii) the date or dates when such cost was incurred by the village or someone
working on behalf of the village; and (iv) a statement that the lien has been
filed pursuant to one (1) or more of the property maintenance activities
described in section
5-1-1(B)(2) and authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7D.
After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified mail to the
property owner, his or her agent or legal representative or occupant in legal
possession or control of the premises and, if different, to the person who
received the tax bill for the preceding year.
The village may not file a lien if the lender has provided notice to the
village that the lender has performed, or will perform, remedial actions;
provided, however, that the remedial actions must be performed or initiated in
good faith within thirty (30) days of the lender's notice to the village.

person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.

dog or other animal shall be quarantined for a period of at least ten (10) days
(upon request of any police officer, animal warden or other person charged with
the enforcement of this chapter) and to deliver such animal to them for such
placement. The owner shall immediately furnish the police department with the
name and location of said hospital and a certificate of a licensed veterinarian
stating whether or not such dog or animal shows symptoms of rabies. At the
expiration of the quarantine period and prior to the release of such dog or
other animal, the owner shall furnish the police department with another
certificate of a licensed veterinarian stating that such dog or other animal
does not have rabies. All costs of maintaining any such dog or other animal in
a veterinary hospital shall be the obligation and responsibility of its owner
and shall be paid by said owner. If, however, the rabies inspector or licensed
veterinarian has presented evidence that such dog or other animal has been
inoculated against rabies within the time prescribed by law prior to the
biting, such dog or other animal shall be confined in the house of its owner or
in a manner that will prohibit such dog or other animal from biting any person
or pet for a period of ten (10) days, unless in the judgment of the police
department, animal warden or the licensed veterinarian, circumstances are such
that the dog or other animal should be confined elsewhere. At the end of the
ten (10) day period, the dog or other animal shall be examined by the rabies
inspector or a licensed veterinarian.
   C.   In all cases where the animal that has bitten a person is slain or dies
within ten (10) days from the time of the biting, it shall be the duty of the
person slaying such animal and the owner of such animal to notify the police
department and to immediately deliver the head of such animal intact to said
department or cause the same to be done. Such head shall be sent to the state
department of health for examination for rabies.
   D.   Any animal found to be rabid by a licensed veterinarian shall be
destroyed according to all applicable statutes and rules of the Illinois and
Lake County departments of health.
   E.   It shall be an adequate defense to any charge of violation of this
section for the charged owner or possessor of an alleged biting or attacking
dog or other animal to show that the animal was defending its owner, another
person or the owner's property or that it was in a fenced in area or other
enclosure when the same was invaded by the person or animal bitten.
   F.   In recognition and in memoriam of the little dog which was bitten and
killed by a loose animal with a history of prior bites, this section shall
hereafter be known as "Gizmo's law". (Ord. 10-02-04, 2-16-2010)

or other domestic animal. All dogs, cats, domestic animals or other animals
kept within any area of the village shall be confined by means of a secure
leash or chain, or confined within a fenced area in such a manner as to prevent
the dog, cat, domestic animal or other animal from running at large. Any dog,
cat, domestic animal or other animal found running at large in violation
hereof, or that shall menace the public welfare is declared to be a public
nuisance and shall be apprehended and impounded in the manner provided in this
chapter.
   C.   Animal Wastes Disposed Of By Owner: All persons walking their dogs or
other domestic animals on the public property of the village, or on any private

necessary for the placing of any droppings or feces, while the animal is on the
public or private property other than his own. The owner of the animal shall
place the droppings in the receptacle to be disposed of in a proper garbage
container or lavatory. Should any person walking a dog or other domestic animal
be found without the receptacle, it shall be the duty of the law enforcement

6-1-8: PROCEDURE WHEN PERSON IS BITTEN:

person, to sell or give away such dog, cat, domestic animal or other animal or
allow such dog, cat, domestic or other animal to be taken beyond the limits of

or his authorized agent of the circumstance aforesaid, to deliver such dog,
cat, domestic or other animal within twenty four (24) hours to a licensed

the owner. Where there is a failure to comply within twenty four (24) hours
with the order from the animal warden or his authorized agent to have such dog,
cat, domestic or other animal examined, confined and observed as provided
herein, the animal warden or his authorized agent, upon a showing of reasonable
evidence that such dog, cat, domestic or other animal has bitten a person, may
seek a court order to have such dog, cat, domestic or other animal confined and
observed. Within twenty four (24) hours after the dog, cat, domestic or other
animal is examined and confined, the veterinarian shall report (as required by
section 12 of the Illinois rabies control act 1 ) to the animal warden, the
owner's name, address and the date of confinement, the breed, description, age

other animal shall be confined for a period of ten (10) days. At the
termination of the period of confinement, the veterinarian shall notify the
animal warden in writing of the final disposition of the animal.
   B.   If, however, the dog, cat, domestic or other animal is examined by a
licensed veterinarian within twenty four (24) hours after notification by the
animal warden and found to be free of signs of rabies, and the animal warden or
the licensed veterinarian is presented evidence that such dog, cat, domestic or
other animal has been inoculated against rabies more than thirty (30) days
prior to the biting and less than one year, if a one year immunity vaccine is
used, or less than three (3) years if a three (3) year vaccine is used, such
dog, cat, domestic or other animal shall be confined in the house of its owner
or in a manner that will prohibit such dog, cat, domestic or other animal from
escaping and from biting any person or animal for the ten (10) day period,
unless in the judgment of the animal warden or the licensed veterinarian,
circumstances are such that the dog, cat, domestic or other animal should be
confined elsewhere. At the end of the ten (10) day period, it shall be the duty
of the owner to present the dog, cat, domestic or other animal to a licensed
veterinarian for examination. The licensed veterinarian shall then notify the
animal warden, in writing, within twenty four (24) hours of the results of the
examination.
   C.   If the dog, cat, domestic or other animal escapes from the house of its
owner, or from such other place of confinement provided by its owner, during
the ten (10) day confinement period, or if the owner fails to deliver the dog,
cat, domestic or other animal to a licensed veterinarian for reexamination
within twenty four (24) hours of the completion of the ten (10) day confinement
period, the owner is declared to be in violation of this section and is subject
to the penalties provided in this chapter. In addition, the owner of an escaped
dog, cat, domestic or other animal shall immediately apprehend it and deliver
it to a licensed veterinarian for confinement, at the owner's expense, for the
remainder of the ten (10) day period.
   D.   The owner of a dog, cat, domestic or other animal, four (4) months of
age or older, not currently inoculated against rabies, as provided elsewhere in
this chapter, must have the dog inoculated against rabies at the time of
release from confinement. (1976 Code § 91.011)

use or benefit. (1976 Code § 13.001)
   B.   Theft Of Lost Or Mislaid Property: A person who obtains control over
lost or mislaid property commits theft when he:
      1.   Knows or learns the identity of the owner or knows, or is aware of,
or learns of a reasonable method of identifying the owner; and

without the consent, of the person providing the property, labor or services.
(1976 Code § 130.003)
   D.   Offender's Interest In Property:
      1.   It is no defense to a charge of theft of property that the offender
has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the
offender is not entitled.
      2.   Where the property involved is that of the offender's spouse, no
prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living
together as a legal couple and were living in separate abodes at the time of

(Ord. 11-08-13, 8-15-2011)
6-4-5: PROCEDURE:
When the chief of police receives one or more police reports documenting the
occurrence of a nuisance activity on or within a property, the chief of police
shall independently review such reports to determine whether they describe
criminal acts. Upon such findings, the chief may:
   A.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger
of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following
information:
      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
      2.   A statement that the chief of police has information that the
property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the
nuisance activities that may exist or that have occurred. The chief of police
shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action
that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise
to the violation;
      3.   Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police
within ten (10) days to discuss the nuisance activities.
   B.   If after complying with the notification procedures described herein
the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a
third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the
property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall:
      1.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been
determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall conform to the
following:
         a.   It shall set forth the street address or legal description
sufficient for identification of the property;
         b.   It shall include a statement that the chief of police has
determined the property to be a chronic nuisance property with a concise
description of the nuisance activities leading to his/her findings;
         c.   It shall demand that the person in charge respond within ten (10)
days to the chief of police and propose a course of action that the chief of
police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation;
         d.   Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at
the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such
other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the
determination by the chief of police;
         e.   A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such address
as shown on the tax rolls of Lake County, Illinois, and/or the occupant, at the
address of the property, if these persons are different than the person in
charge, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage
prepaid;
         f.   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after
the ten (10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the
person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the chief of
police;
         g.   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may
be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this chapter.
      2.   If, after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the village pursuant to this chapter, a person in charge
stipulates with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a
course of action that parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving
rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal
proceedings for a period of not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30)
days. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the
nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within
thirty (30) days, the chief of police shall request the village attorney or
prosecuting attorney to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance.
      3.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the
chief of police shall send copies of the notices, as well as any other
documentation which supports legal proceedings, to the village attorney.
   C.   When a person in charge makes a response to the chief of police as
required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance
activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the
exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for any
other purpose. (Ord. 11-08-13, 8-15-2011)
6-4-6: COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION; BURDEN OF PROOF:
   A.   In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, or seeking
to impose a civil penalty, the village shall have the burden of showing by
preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   B.   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of chronic nuisance
property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in
the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had
become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of
reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that
the property is a chronic nuisance property. The owner shall have the burden of
proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
   C.   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court
may consider any of the following factors if they find appropriate, and shall
cite those found applicable:
      1.   The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to
mitigate or correct the problem at the property;
      2.   Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous;
      3.   The magnitude or gravity of the problem;
      4.   The cooperation of the person in charge with the village;
      5.   The cost of the village investigating and correcting or attempting
to correct the condition. (Ord. 11-08-13, 8-15-2011)
6-4-7: EMERGENCY CLOSING PROCEDURES:
   A.   In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate
threat to the public safety and welfare, the village may apply to the circuit
court for such interim relief, as is deemed by the chief of police in
consultation with the village attorney to be appropriate. In such an event, the
notification provision set forth in section
6-4-5 of this chapter need not be complied with, however, the village shall
make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing.
   B.   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic
nuisance property" as defined in section
6-4-2 of this chapter, the court may order such remedies as are provided for in
this chapter. In addition, in the event that it also finds a person in charge
had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or
violating this chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may
assess a civil penalty as provided for in this chapter.
   C.   The court may authorize the village of Antioch to physically secure the
property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within
the time specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to
secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect the
closure shall be accounted for and assessed as a lien against the property. If
used herein, "costs" mean those costs actually incurred by the village for the
physical securing of the property, as well as any tenant relocation costs the
village might incur.
   D.   The village of Antioch employee effectuating the closure shall prepare
a statement of costs and the village of Antioch shall thereafter submit such
statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made
within the period described by the court, a lien in such amount may be recorded
against such property.
   E.   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by
the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the village.
   F.   As an ancillary to any enforcement action, the court shall have the
power to adjudicate any claim brought in the form of a petition with due and
proper notice by a displaced, innocent tenant against the owner for damages
occasioned by the loss of use of any property, and the court may award judgment
in favor of such tenant against the owner in its discretion based upon the
evidence presented. (Ord. 11-08-13, 8-15-2011)
6-4-8: DISCRETIONARY ACTION:
The provisions of this chapter are designed and intended to give discretion to
the chief of police, the village attorney, the prosecuting attorney and any
other village employees or agents. They are intended to provide useful tools
and mechanisms for dealing with chronic problem properties and to help preserve
order and peace within the community. For these reasons, the following
provisions, consistent with the reservation of discretion shall apply:
   A.   Nothing herein is intended, and nothing shall be construed as
intending, to create rights in citizens to require action to be taken by any
official, employee or agent of the village.
   B.   Nothing herein is intended to give any tenant whose tenancy is
disrupted by any action taken pursuant to this chapter a charge or claim
against the village for costs of relocation or loss of use of any rental
property. (Ord. 11-08-13, 8-15-2011)
6-4-9: EXEMPTIONS:
Notwithstanding any other provisions within this chapter, and consistent with
the terms and conditions of 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-2-1.5, no
property shall be considered a chronic nuisance if the police investigations
described in section
6-4-2 of this chapter arise from calls for assistance from any victim of
domestic abuse or person with a disability. Additionally, no victim of domestic
abuse or person with a disability shall be evicted, sanctioned or punished in
any way resulting from his or her seeking public assistance or police
protection relating to that abuse or condition. However, nothing herein shall
prevent the enforcement of this code against an owner of the property who may
be a victim of domestic abuse or be disabled, but whose victimhood or
disability is unrelated to the law enforcement activity causing the property to
be a chronic nuisance. (Ord. 15-10-11, 10-5-2015)

thirty (30) days after the application was filed with the village.
         c.   The chief of police's review of the application shall take into
consideration administrative efficiency and available resources, public safety
and orderly traffic flow, and an approval shall be subject to such conditions
and restrictions that the chief of police may impose in his or her sole
discretion (including, without limitation, those addressing day/time
availability of any such location(s), number of daily arrivals/departures to/
from any such location(s), and advance notification requirements by the
applicant). The chief of police may also require certified medical
documentation that passengers are not presently, and have not within the last
thirty (30) days prior to the date of unloading, been diagnosed or has
contracted any contagious disease such as malaria, tuberculosis or such other
contagious disease that, if spread to others, would adversely affect others
health, safety or welfare; provided, however, that such certification shall not
be required of domiciled residents of the United States who have not, within
the last thirty (30) days prior to unloading, traveled to a country
experiencing an outbreak of any such contagious disease.
         d.   If the chief of police denies the application, it shall be based
upon a determination that the loading/unloading of passengers, luggage or other
goods at that time, or in that particular designated bus stop, bus stand,
passenger loading/unloading zone or other location presents an unreasonable
threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public or impedes the safe and
efficient flow of traffic or imposes an unreasonable burden on available
resources. If the chief of police denies the application, the chief of police
shall send by e-mail or U.S. mail a notification to the applicant in writing
specifying the reasons for the decision. Any applicant may seek review of the
decision of the chief of police denying such application in the manner provided
by law.

7-3-16: TRUCK ROUTES:
   A.   Certain roads within the village are, by their location, design and
construction, amenable to vehicular traffic including heavy and/or large
trucks, whereas other local roads are not capable of accommodating these
vehicles safely, and the roads could be unduly damaged by such traffic. For
these reasons, the village adopts and designates certain truck routes as the
appropriate roads for truck traffic.
   B.   No person shall operate any vehicle with a (i) Gross vehicle weight
rating (GVWR), whether single vehicle or in combination; or (ii) Gross vehicle
weight (GVW),whether single vehicle or in combination; or (iii) A registered
vehicle weight rating, whether single vehicle or in combination, exceeding
twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds upon any roadway under the jurisdiction of
the Village, other than designated truck routes as identified in paragraph D of
this section; except that such vehicles may be operated thereon for the purpose
of delivering or picking up loads, material, or merchandise, and then only by
entering such road at the intersection nearest the destination of the vehicle
and proceeding thereon no further than the nearest intersection thereafter.
   C.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to school buses, village
contracted refuse and rubbish haulers, roadway and utility maintenance
vehicles, emergency vehicles, or any other vehicles engaged in any activity
sanctioned or approved by the Village. The provisions of this section shall
also not apply to vehicles acting in compliance with the instruction of a
police officer, a posted detour route, or an overweight permit issued by the

provided for in paragraph B of this section shall drive such vehicle only upon
the following roads, which are hereby designated as truck routes:

7-3-17: TRUCK AND TRAILER PARKING RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Certain roads within the village are, by their location, design and
construction, amenable to vehicular traffic including heavy and/or large trucks
and trailers, whereas other local roads are not capable of accommodating these
vehicles safely, and the roads could be unduly damaged by such traffic.
Additionally, many of the residential roads and smaller commercial roads are
not wide enough to safely accommodate parking of larger trucks and trailers and
often larger trucks are powered with correspondingly large engines which make a
lot more noise and can disturb the peace of neighborhoods. For these reasons,
the village finds it necessary to prohibit parking of large trucks and trailers
on any roads other than those specifically designated in subsection B of this
section.
   B.   It is prohibited to park vehicles bearing vehicle license plates other
than class A, B, C, D, TX, PT, LI, M and RV, or any trailer bearing license
plates other than class TB, TC and TD on any village street other than upon the
following roads, which are hereby designated as truck routes:

vehicles, moving vans, construction vehicles working on local construction
projects and the like.

approved by the village which have developed lots or vacant lots, said
subdivisions or planned unit developments shall provide on newly constructed
buildings for connection to the storm sewers, as long as said storm sewers are
adjacent to the lot. If it is impractical to connect to the existing storm
sewer because of expense or lack of proper hookup facilities, then the sump
pump discharge lines can be located on the surface of the lot at minimum
distance from the property lines as determined by the setback and side yard
requirements for that principal structure or ten feet (10'), whichever is
greater. The department of public works shall determine whether it is too

8-1A-1: WATER AND SEWER SERVICE CHARGES:
There are hereby established rates and charges for the use of the services
supplied by the combined waterworks and sewerage system of the village, based
upon the amount of water consumed, as shown by water meters as follows:
   A.   Users Within Corporate Limits:
      1.   Water Service Charge Bimonthly: For each residential, commercial,
industrial and municipal user of the water service of the combined waterworks
and sewerage system, there shall be a bimonthly charge or rate based upon the
amount of water consumed each bimonthly period as follows:
The minimum charge for water service applicable to each single metered account
shall be twelve dollars ($12.00) each bimonthly period and six dollars ($6.00)
each bimonthly period for each additional unit served through a single
connection.
Metered water flow charges shall be two dollars fifty eight cents ($2.58) per
each one thousand (1,000) gallons used effective August 1, 2013. On each
subsequent August 1, the rate will increase by three percent (3%) to meet the
needs of the increasing operating costs without the need of further action by
the corporate authorities.
      2.   Sewer Service Charges Bimonthly: For each residential, commercial,
industrial and municipal user of the sewer service of the combined waterworks
and sewerage system, there shall be a bimonthly sewer charge based upon the
amount of water consumed each bimonthly period. This bimonthly sewer charge
shall consist of two (2) separate components, being a minimum charge and a user
rate. The user rate is divided into two (2) service areas, one serviced by the
Antioch municipal wastewater treatment plant and one serviced by the Lake
County public works wastewater treatment plant.
         a.   Minimum Charges: The minimum charge applicable to each additional
unit served through a single sewer tap shall be fifty percent (50%) of the
charge applicable to single metered connections. These are calculated as
follows:
 
Each Metered User Each Additional Unit
$26.00            $13.00
 
         b.   Bimonthly User Rates:
            (1)   West Service Area: In the west service area, metered water
flow charges shall be four dollars twelve cents ($4.12) per each one thousand
(1,000) gallons effective August 1, 2013. Each subsequent year the rate will
increase by three percent (3%) to meet the needs of the increasing operating
costs without the need of further action by the corporate authorities.
            (2)   East Service Area: In the east service area, metered water
flow charges shall be four dollars twelve cents ($4.12) per each one thousand
(1,000) gallons effective August 1, 2013. Each subsequent year the rate will
increase by three percent (3%) to meet the needs of the increasing operating
costs without the need of further action by the corporate authorities.
Additionally, in the event the Lake County department of public works increases
its treatment fees, the rate will increase proportionally to those increases
without the need of further action by the corporate authorities.
         c.   Appropriation Of Funds:
            (1)   East Service Area: The bimonthly sewer charges for sewer
service applicable to each single metered connection in the east service area
shall be received as restricted funds to be used for the following:
               (A)   To pay fixed expenses applicable to the operation and
maintenance and replacement of the sewer collection system;
               (B)   To pay the treatment charges imposed by the Lake County
department of public works.
            (2)   West Service Area: The bimonthly sewer charges for sewer
service applicable to each single metered connection in the west service area
shall be received as restricted funds to be used for the following:
               (A)   To pay fixed expenses applicable to the operation and
maintenance and replacement of the sewer collection system;
               (B)   To pay fixed expenses applicable to the operation and
maintenance of the wastewater treatment plant; and
               (C)   To pay a proportional share of any applicable annual debt
service requirements of bonds or loans applicable to the water treatment plant.
   B.   Users Outside Corporate Limits:
      1.   Each user of the combined system of the village located outside the
corporate limits shall be billed at the rate of two hundred percent (200%) of
the rate charged to properties within the corporate limits as set out in
subsection A of this section.
      2.   For those properties served by the Oakwood Knolls Water Association
the minimum charge for water service applicable to each single metered account
shall be twelve dollars ($12.00) each bimonthly period and six dollars ($6.00)
each bimonthly period for each additional unit served through a single
connection. Metered water flow charges shall be billed at the rate charged to
properties within the corporate limits as set out in subsection A of this
section.
   C.   Water Service Only: For each user of the water service only of the
combined system within the corporate limits there shall be a bimonthly charge
based upon the amount of water consumed each bimonthly period as follows:
Each one thousand (1,000) gallons at two dollars fifty eight cents ($2.58) per
one thousand (1,000) gallons.
Metered water flow charges shall be two dollars fifty eight cents ($2.58) per
each one thousand (1,000) gallons used effective August 1, 2013. On each
subsequent August 1, the rate will increase by three percent (3%) to meet the
needs of the increasing operating costs without the need of further action by
the corporate authorities.
The minimum charge for water service only shall be twelve dollars ($12.00) each
bimonthly period.
   D.   Sewer Service Only: For each nonmetered user of the sewerage system
within the corporate limits there shall be a flat rate charge of eighty six
dollars ($86.00) each bimonthly period. The flat rate charge is computed in the
following manner:
 
Basic user charges              $16.00
Debt service charge             10.00
Usage rate to 15,000 gallons    60.00
Total nonmetered use            $86.00
 
On August 1, 2014, and on each subsequent August 1 thereafter, the usage rate
will increase by three percent (3%) to meet the needs of the increasing
operating costs without the need of further action by the corporate
authorities.
In the event usage of the wastewater facilities is determined to be in excess
of fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons per bimonthly period, the village may
require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the water supply or
sewer main to measure the amount of services supplied.
   E.   Multiple-Unit Users: A "multiple-unit user" is defined as any
additional number of family or commercial units located on the same premises,
or being served through a single water meter or sewer connection, where there
are no separate water meters for each unit, such as apartment buildings, more
than one commercial unit in the same building, or commercial and residential
units located in the same building. In all such cases, there shall be an
additional basic user charge and debt service charge for each additional unit
provided with water and sewer service and served by the single connection. The
additional charges applicable to the number of units served through the single
connection shall be added to the single metered connection for services.
   F.   The corporate authorities may, by ordinance and subject to such
conditions or requirements as they deem necessary, waive or reduce the water
service charge and/or the sewer service under this section why they determine
that the public interest will be served by such waiver.
(Ord. 13-12-24, 12-16-2013; amd. Ord. 24-05-28, 5-8-2024)
8-1A-2: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
8-1A-2-1: BASIC DATA FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
The user charge system hereinafter set forth has been developed from data
outlined in the report of McClure Engineering Associates, Inc., Waukegan,
Illinois, entitled "Report On The Revisions Of The User Charges Of The
Wastewater System Of The Village Of Antioch, Lake County, Illinois", said
report being incorporated herein by reference and which shall constitute the
basis for determining user charges in the village. (1976 Code § 51.005)
8-1A-2-2: BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
   A.   The wastewater service charges for the use of and for services supplied
by the wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user
charge to pay expenses for operation, maintenance and replacement of the
system, a fixed debt service charge, variable debt service rate and a
surcharge, if applicable.
   B.   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal volume and
concentrations:
      1.   A flow of four thousand (4,000) gallons per bimonthly period.
      2.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD5) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
      3.   A suspended solids content of two hundred forty milligrams per liter
(240 mg/l).
      4.   Ammonia nitrogen content of thirty milligrams per liter (30 mg/l).
      5.   A phosphorus content (P) of twenty five milligrams per liter (25 mg/
l).
   C.   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement,
and shall be computed as follows:
      1.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund, for the next
fiscal year for all works categories.
      2.   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by
volume, suspended solids, BOD5 and phosphorus.
      3.   Estimate waterworks volume, pounds of SS, pounds of BOD5 and pounds
of phosphorus to be treated.
      4.   Compute units costs for volume (dollars per 1,000 gallons), for SS
(dollars per pound), for BOD5 (dollars per pound), for ammonia nitrogen
(dollars per pound), and for phosphorus (dollars per pound).
      5.   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for volume, SS, BOD5,
NH3 and phosphorus at normal sewage strength. Add these costs to determine the
charge for operation and maintenance, including replacement. (1976 Code §
51.006)
   D.   There is hereby established a debt service charge in the amount as
established in section
8-1A-1 of this article per bimonthly period for each single metered user served
by the sanitary sewer system of the village, and in the amount as established
in section
8-1A-1 of this article per bimonthly period for each additional user or unit
served through a single meter. A component of the debt service charge in the
amount of four dollars ($4.00) per bimonthly period applicable to each single
metered or multiple-unit user shall be separately allocated by the village for
payment of a loan under the Illinois environmental protection agency revolving
loan program. (1976 Code § 51.006; amd. Ord. 02-03-10, 3-18-2002; Ord. 08-04-
07, 4-7-2008)
   E.   1. In the event use of the wastewater facilities by nonresidential
users is determined by the superintendent to include wastes in addition to
average strength domestic waste, the user shall pay a surcharge cost in
addition to the debt service charge, the basic user charge and the basic user
rates.
      2.   A surcharge will be levied upon all users whose wastes exceed the
normal concentrations for BOD5 (200 mg/l), SS (240 mg/l), NH3 (30 mg/l) and
phosphorus (25 mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the
concentrations for BOD5, SS, ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus content,
respectively. Section
8-1A-2-5 of this article specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge. (Ord.
13-12-24, 12-16-2013)
8-1A-2-3: MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
   A.   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
one thousand (1,000) gallons.
   B.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by
the superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained
from these other sources.
   C.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by
the superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records.
   D.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, these meters may not be removed without the consent of the
superintendent. (1976 Code § 51.007)
8-1A-2-4: SURCHARGE RATE:
The rates of surcharge shall be as follows:
 
For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5)    $0.19 per pound
For suspended solids (SS)                0.10 per pound
For ammonia nitrogen (NH3)               0.53 per pound
For phosphorus content (P)               0.82 per pound
 
(Ord. 13-12-24, 12-16-2013)
8-1A-2-5: COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGE:
   A.   The surcharge per person shall be computed by the following formula:
S - V (0.00834) (A (BOD 5-200) + B (SS-240) ) + C (NH3-30) + D (P-25), where
S       = Amount of surcharge
V       = Wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons/billing period
0.00834 = Unit weight of water x 10-6/1,000 gallons
A       = Unit charge per pound for BOD5
BOD5    = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, mg/l
200     = Allowable BOD5 strength
B       = Unit charge per pound of SS, mg/l
240     = Allowable SS, mg/l
C       = Unit charge per pound of NH3 mg/l
D       = Unit charge per pound of P mg/l
30      = Allowable NH3 mg/l
25      = Allowable P mg/l
 
   B.   The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be
established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as
may be deemed necessary by the superintendent, and shall be binding as a basis
for surcharge. (1976 Code § 51.010)
8-1A-2-6: COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
The wastewater service charge per person shall be computed by the following
formula:
W = D + M + (V-4,000) R + S, where:
W = D + M + (V-4,000) R + S, where:
W     = Amount of wastewater service charge ($)/billing period
D     = Debt service charge 1
M     = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
V     = Wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons/billing period
4,000 = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge
R     = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement
S     = Amount of surcharge2

connection therewith and to collect all monies due thereon.
   B.   Delinquent Charges: In the event the charges for service are not paid
within ninety (90) days after rendition of the bill for such service, such
charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent, and
thereafter such delinquencies shall constitute liens upon the real estate for
which such service is supplied, and the village clerk is hereby authorized and
directed to file a sworn statement showing such delinquencies in the office of
the recorder of deeds of Lake County, Illinois, and the filing of such
statement shall be deemed a lien and public notice for the payment of such
charges for such service. The owner of the property shall be responsible for
the payment of fees to record and release such liens as well as an
administrative fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00). (Ord. 13-12-24, 12-16-2013)

(90) days for bimonthly service after it has been rendered, the village
treasurer shall file with the county recorder of deeds a statement of lien
claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises
served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a notice that the village claims a
lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the period
covered by the bill.
      2.   If the consumer whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the
premises and the village treasurer has notice of this, notice shall be mailed
to the owner of the premises if his address is known to the village treasurer,
whenever the bill remains unpaid for the period of ninety (90) days, or a
bimonthly bill after it has been rendered. (1976 Code § 51.039; amd. Ord. 13-
12-24, 12-16-2013)
      3.   The failure of the village treasurer to record the lien or to mail
the notice, or the failure of the owner to receive the notice, shall not affect
the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in subsection B2
of this section. (1976 Code § 51.039)
   C.   Foreclosure Of Lien: Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges
shall be sold for nonpayment of the lien, and the proceeds of the sale shall be
applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. The foreclosure shall be by bill in equity in
the name of the village. The village attorney is authorized and directed to
institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has
remained unpaid ninety (90) days for a bimonthly bill after it has been
rendered. (1976 Code § 51.040; amd. Ord. 13-12-24, 12-16-2013)
8-1A-8: WATER SHUTOFF; APPLICATION AND FEE:
Any owner desiring for his convenience a shutting off of the water supply shall

charges elsewhere provided in this article. The village reserves the right to
refuse to turn water off in the event persons other than the one requesting the
shut off are residing in the property. (Ord. 13-12-24, 12-16-2013)
8-1A-9: REVENUES AND ACCOUNTING:
   A.   Revenues:
      1.   All revenues and monies derived from the operation of the combined
waterworks and sewer system shall be held by the village treasurer separate and
apart from her private funds and separate and apart from all other funds of the
village, and all of said sum, without any deduction whatever, shall be
delivered to the village treasurer not more than ten (10) days after receipt of
the same, or at such more frequent intervals as may from time to time be
directed by the mayor and board of trustees.
      2.   The village treasurer shall receive all such revenues from the
combined waterworks and sewer system and all other funds and monies incident to
the operation of said system as the same may be delivered to her and deposit
the same in a separate fund designated as the "waterworks and sewerage fund of
the village of Antioch" and said treasurer shall administer such fund in every
respect in the manner provided by the applicable provisions of division 139 of
article 11 of the Illinois municipal code, approved May 29, 1961, and all laws
amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto and as provided in the ordinances
heretofore adopted authorizing the issuance of bonds and the loan agreement of
said village.
   B.   Accounting:
      1.   a. The waterworks and sewerage fund is the principal accounting
designation for all revenues received and expenses incurred in the operation of
the waterworks and/or sewerage system. These revenues and expenses shall be
accounted for so that water system revenues and expenses shall be recorded
separately in the waterworks account of the fund and revenues and expenses of
the sewerage system shall be recorded separately in the sewer account of the
waterworks and sewerage fund. (Ord. 13-12-24, 12-16-2013)
         b.   The village treasurer shall establish a proper system of accounts
and shall keep proper books, records and accounts in which complete and correct
entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the waterworks and
sewerage system. At regular annual intervals, he shall cause to be made an

8-2-1-1: ENACTMENT:
Pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act of 1970, as
amended, and in accordance with Illinois Municipal Code, this chapter,
hereafter known as the SEWER USE AND PRETREATMENT ORDINANCE, is hereby enacted
by the board of trustees of the village of Antioch. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-1-2: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned
treatment works (POTW) for the village of Antioch, hereafter referred to
interchangeably as the village. This chapter provides for the use of public and
private sewers and drains, private sewage disposal, and authorizes the
installation and continuing of connections into the sewage works of the village
upon certain conditions, including permission thereof; providing for the
installation and maintenance of such connections and enforcements thereto;
regulating the use of municipal and private sewers and drains; individual
wastewater disposal, the installation, connection and disconnection of building
sewers, the discharge of water and waste in the public sewer system providing
for penalties for violation thereof; and providing for penalties for violation
thereof; and providing for termination of permits issued by the village
pursuant to the provisions hereof.
This chapter enables the village to comply with all applicable state and
federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1251 et seq.) and the
General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). Additional objectives of
this chapter are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will pass
through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   C.   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by air, wastewater
and biosolids in the course of their employment and the general public;
   D.   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and biosolids
from the POTW;
   E.   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW;
   F.   To enable the village to comply with its national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permit conditions, biosolids use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject;
   G.   To provide uniform requirements for food service establishments for the
control of grease discharge to the sanitary sewer system; and
   H.   To regulate private wastewater disposal systems.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW and provides for the
enforcement of general requirements for users. The chapter authorizes the
issuance of wastewater connection and discharge permits; provides for
monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative
review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the programs
established herein. This chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater
discharge permits that do not allow the discharge of defined process waste
streams but continue to allow the discharge of domestic or sanitary wastewater.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-1-3: ADMINISTRATION:
Except as otherwise provided herein, the pretreatment coordinator and duly
authorized agent(s) shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the pretreatment
coordinator and duly authorized agent(s) may be delegated by the village or
pretreatment coordinator to other village personnel or agents of the village.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-1-4: JURISDICTION:
This chapter shall apply to the village and to persons outside the village who
are, by contract or agreement with the village, users of the village POTW.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-1-5: FUNDING:
It is the intent of the village to pass some of the costs of the pretreatment
program to industrial users. The charges that shall apply to those users
subject to the pretreatment program are based on SIU classification and are
established in article C of this chapter. Billing shall be based on the billing
cycle for water and sewer and shall be added on to the water and sewer bill.
The rates or charges for pretreatment service shall be payable bi-monthly. The
owner of the premises, the occupant thereof, and the user of the service shall
be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service to such premises and the
service is furnished to the premises by the village only upon the condition
that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the service are jointly
and severally liable therefore to the village. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)

SOURCE:
               A.   Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is (or may
               be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced after the
               publication of proposed pretreatment standards under Section 307 (c) of the Act which
               will be applicable to such source if such standards are thereafter promulgated in
               accordance with that section, provided that one of the following is true:
                  1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at a site
               which no other source is located;
                  2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces the
               process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing

               facility, or installations are substantially independent of an existing source at the
               same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such as
               the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the
               extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as
               the existing source, should be considered.
               B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a
               modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new
NEW SOURCE:    building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of subsection A2
               or A3 of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process
               or production equipment.
               C.   Construction of a new source as defined under this paragraph has commenced if the
               owner of operator has done one of the following:

                  2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities
               or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable time.
               Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without
               substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do
               not constitute a contractual obligation under this paragraph.
               D.   New sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall "start-up"
               all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards

interrupted for a period of seven (7) calendar days or more, the village
engineer shall be notified twenty four (24) hours prior to continuing
construction of the sewer extension.
      6.   At the time a sewer extension is connected to an existing sewer, the
connection shall be made at an existing manhole of in a manhole constructed
over the existing sewer. If an existing manhole is the point of connection and
a suitable stub is not provided for the extension, the existing manhole shall
be core drilled and a suitable connection stub installed. The sewer extension
shall be plugged with a water tight concrete plug by the contractor at the time
the connection to the existing sewer is made. The plug shall be maintained in
place at all times until the sewer extension is approved in writing by the
village engineer. If the plug is not maintained in place, the village engineer
shall install a concrete plug and charge a fee to the contractor for each time
a plug is installed by the village engineer. The fee for the installation of a
plug is established by the village in article C of this chapter. Mechanical
plugs are also an acceptable means of plugging the sewer to maintain it out of
service.
      7.   Upon completion of construction, the contractor shall notify the
village engineer requesting final review of the work. The contractor shall
televise the completed extension in the presence of a village engineer or his
designee who will take immediate possession of the videotape prior to leaving
the site. The village engineer shall review the work for conformance with the
village's requirements and adherence to the approved plans and specifications
for which the village's sewer extension permit was issued. If deficiencies are
found in the work, the village engineer shall furnish the contractor with a
listing of such deficiencies. When the contractor believes that the
deficiencies have been corrected, the contractor shall request a re-review of
the work. Should the re-review of the work show that the deficiencies as set
forth have not been corrected, the contractor shall make the necessary
corrections, and subsequent to that, shall notify the village engineer and
request another review. The village engineer shall charge a fee for each
additional inspection after the first inspection following the issuance of the
list of deficiencies. The fee for each additional review is published as part
of article C of this chapter.
      8.   All sanitary sewers shall be constructed within public rights-of-way
or within easements dedicated for public utilities. No sanitary sewer mains
shall be installed nor their easements established in the rear or side yard of
any property unless first approved by the VE.

village or in any area under the jurisdiction of the village, any human or
animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste.
   It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the village,
or in any area under the jurisdiction of the village without the express
approval from the village engineer (VE) that all state and federal effluent
limitations have been met and there are no reasonable alternative methods of
disposal.
   B.   Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or
maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility
intended or used for the disposal of sewage.
   C.   The owner of all the houses, buildings, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation or other purpose situated within the village
and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located
or may in the future be located any public sanitary sewer of the village, is
hereby required at his expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein,
and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, within ninety (90) days after
date of official notice to do so, provided that said public sewer is within two
hundred feet (200' (61 m)) of the property line. If such public sewer benefits
other properties, the village board may enact a recapture ordinance and make
best efforts to assure that the benefitted property owners pay to the owner
amounts as required. All public sewer extensions shall be made in accordance
with section
8-2-2-2 of this chapter.
   D.   It shall be unlawful to discharge any sanitary waste, including,
without limitation, any residential, commercial or industrial liquid waste
product into any storm sewer, drainage facility, retention pond, detention pond
or other stormwater control structure or device located within the village
limits. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-3-2: PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL:
No person shall construct a wastewater treatment facility within the corporate
limits of the village or in any area under the jurisdiction of the village for
the purpose of treating wastewater and discharging same to a water course
unless the following provisions are met.
   A.   For the purpose of treating industrial wastes, the VE determines that
the wastewater treatment facilities have inadequate capacity, and issues a
permit for the construction and operation of a wastewater treatment facility.
No village permit shall become effective until:
      1.   The VE has approved the plans and specifications in writing;
      2.   Approval has been obtained from the Lake County Department of
Health;
      3.   An IEPA permit issued to construct the facility has been received;
      4.   An IEPA NPDES permit to operate the facility has been issued and
received; and
      5.   The final inspection has been completed the installation is
completed to the satisfaction by the VE.
      Persons operating a wastewater treatment facility shall file copies of
all operating reports sent to the USEPA and IEPA with the VE and such other
reports as the VE deems necessary.
   B.   Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of
section
8-2-3-1 of this chapter and the wastewater source to be treated is domestic in
nature, the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal
system employing subsurface absorption facilities.
   No person shall construct a private wastewater treatment facility with
subsurface disposal without previous approval from the VE. If approval is given
the person must adhere to the following limitations:
      1.   Permit Requirements:
         a.   Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal
system the owner shall first obtain a written permit signed by the VE. The
application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished by the VE which
the applicant shall supplement by any plans, specifications and other
information as deemed necessary by the VE. A permit and inspection fee as
published in the current title 13 of this code or reimbursement of costs shall
be paid to the village at the time the application is filed. The permit shall
not be issued until applicable state and county permits are on file.
         b.   The type, capacities, location and layout of a private sewage
disposal system shall comply with all regulations and provisions of the state
of Illinois Private Sewage Disposal Licensing Act and Code, with the state of
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Lake County Health Department,
latest revision. No permit shall be issued for any private sewage disposal
system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the
lot is less than forty thousand (40,000) square feet. No septic tank or
cesspool shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
         c.   A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not become
effective until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the VE.
The VE shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction and,
in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the VE when the work is
ready for final inspection, and before any underground portions are covered.
The inspection shall be made within twenty four (24) hours of the receipt of
written notice by the VE, except that no inspections will be made at any time
other than regular village working hours.
   C.   Where development is possible but gravity sewers and conventional sewer
systems are not practical.
   Accordingly, it is the policy of the village to approve grinder pump systems
on a discretionary case-by-case basis. In order to implement a grinder pump
system, a developer or individual homeowner must prove to the VE that a grinder
pump system is the only viable option other than a conventional sanitary sewer
system. A permit for a private wastewater treatment facility employing a
grinder pump system shall not be issued until the design and installation is
completed to the satisfaction of the VE.
      1.   Installation: The VE shall be allowed to inspect the work at any
stage of the construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall
notify the VE when the grinder pump system is ready for final inspection, and
before any underground portions are covered.
      2.   Operation And Maintenance: The VE or his designee shall be entitled
to inspect the grinder pump system if said VE has any reason to believe that
the grinder pump system is not operating properly or pursuant to a routine
inspection protocol developed by the VE. Should the grinder pump system fall
into disrepair or otherwise need maintenance as determined by the VE, and the
owner refuses to repair, replace or otherwise fix the grinder pump system to
the specifications of the village, the village may do so at its own expense and
obtain reimbursement from the individual owner. In that regard, and as a
condition of obtaining a village permit for a grinder pump system, the
individual owner shall enter into a contractual agreement indemnifying the
village for any costs the village may incur with regards to maintaining the
grinder pump system, and further allow the VE reasonable access to the grinder
pump system for inspection purposes.
   D.   Other Provisions:
      1.   The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal
facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, and at no expense to the village.
      2.   As provided in subsection B of this section, at such time as a
public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private Sewage
disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer within
sixty (60) days in compliance with this section. Any septic tanks, cesspools
and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be cleaned of biosolids
and filled with suitable material such as clean bank-run gravel or dirt.
      3.   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to
interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Lake
County Department of Health. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-3-3: BUILDING SEWER AND CONNECTIONS:
   A.   Permit Requirements:
   No person shall construct a new wastewater source and connect same to the
POTW of the village without first making application for the privilege of
making said connection to the village.
      1.   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with, or
opening into; use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the VE and an IEPA permit when
required under 35 Illinois Administrative Code 309.
      2.   No addition to or alteration of any building sewer shall be made or
caused to be made by any person without a permit from the VE and then only
through a sewer contractor. No permit shall authorize anything not explicitly
stated in the application.
      3.   All disposal by any person into the sewer system is unlawful except
those discharges in compliance with federal standards promulgated pursuant to
the Federal Act, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and regulations
promulgated thereto, and the Antioch Municipal Code.
      4.   There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits: for
residential wastewater service, and non-residential (at a minimum commercial,
institutional/governmental or industrial) wastewater service. In either case,
the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by
the village. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of
the VE.
      5.   Persons desiring to construct a new waste source and connect it to
the POTW of the village shall state the quantity, quality and rate of discharge
into the sewer. The non-residential user, as a condition of permit
authorization, must provide information describing its wastewater constituents,
characteristics and type of activity per sections
8-2-4-1 and
8-2-4-4 of this chapter. In the case of any fraudulent representation upon the
part of the user, the permit fees will be forfeited and the use of the sewer
stopped.
      6.   A building sewer permit will only be issued and a sewer connection
shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewerage
facilities, including sewers, pump stations and wastewater treatment
facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently
handle the additional anticipated waste load based on the population
equivalent.
      7.   The applicant will secure a building permit if the waste source is
new equipment to be installed in an existing building with an existing sewer.
      8.   Each excavation for any of the purposes set out in this subsection
shall require a separate permit.
      9.   The building permit will be issued for a period of twenty four (24)
months consistent with the IEPA permits.
   B.   Building Sewer Connections:
      1.   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on
an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer and may be done only with the explicit
approval of the VE.
      2.   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the VE or his designee, to
meet all requirements of this chapter. All costs shall be borne by the
applicant.
      3.   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the
village. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the
American Society of Testing Materials, "Water Pollution Control Federation
Manual of Practice No. 9", and "Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer
Main Construction in Illinois" shall apply.
      4.   No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet
(3') of any bearing wall. No building sewers shall be installed in any place
where they may be subject to freezing temperatures unless adequate provisions
are made to protect them from frost. Changes in direction shall be made only
with properly curbed pipe and fittings, or a manhole, as determined by the VE.
      5.   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer. Where possible, all building sanitary services shall be
"overhead" installations. Buildings having basements will have a pump or
ejector provided to pump the wastewater to the sanitary sewer service for
gravity transport to the sewer main.
      6.   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
a saddle connection and conform to the requirements of the building and
plumbing code, or other applicable rules and regulations of the village, or the
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society of
Testing Materials, "Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No.
9", and "Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in
Illinois". All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
   C.   Construction Requirements: Construction may not be started until all
fees are paid consistent with section
8-2-3-4 of this chapter, title 13 of this code and a written permit is issued
by the village after issuance and receipt of an IEPA permit for the project
when applicable. The following conditions are also required:
      1.   The applicant shall secure a public right-of-way opening permit from
the VE when appropriate in conformance with the provisions of section
13-1-5 of this code.
      2.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the village. Failure
to properly barricade will be cause for the job site to be shut down and a
penalty, as established in the title 13 of this code, must be paid before any
further work can commence.
      3.   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the VE
twenty four (24) hours prior to the start of any underground piping
installation and when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of a
qualified duly authorized agent of the village during regular village working
hours.
      4.   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify
the village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
      5.   The applicant shall file a certificate of liability insurance in the
amount of a minimum of two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) with the village
engineer or clerk to protect the village from any liability or damage
whatsoever for injury, including death, to any person or property.
      6.   Minimum building sanitary service sewer size shall be six inch (6")
diameter. All cleanouts shall be installed on the owner's property and not in
Village ROW. The maximum distance between cleanouts is one hundred twenty feet
(120').
      7.   Sewer services shall not be connected to manholes. All sanitary
sewer services serving single-family residences shall have "blind" connections
to the sewer main (as stated in subsection C8 of this section). Only exceptions
are when homes are located in a cul-de-sac and the connection to the sewer main
would be impractical. This exception must be approved by the VE or his
designee.
      8.   Sewer service connections to existing sewer mains shall be made by
the installation of a strap-on saddle with stainless steel banding in
accordance with manufacturers' recommendations. Romac "CB" style saddles with
stainless steel bands, Geneco "Sealtight" strap-on saddles, PVC saddles meeting
ASTM D3033/ASTM S3034, or other approved manufacturers may be accepted.
      The installation of the new saddle fitting will be use of a circular
sawcut by proper tools ("sewer tap" machine or similar device). All such
connections shall be done in the presence of the VE, or his designated
representative. After the saddle connection has been made, encasement in four
to six inches (4" to 6") of concrete may be required to provide a secure and
watertight connection collar, if in the opinion of the inspector, the existing
pipe is not sufficiently stabilized. Factory wye/tee, Inserta tee© be allowed
on eight inch (8") or ten inch (10") sewer main pipe. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-
2020)
8-2-3-4: FEES:
Fees shall be charged for when permitting and constructing a new wastewater
source and connecting it the POTW of the village and are found in title 13 of
this code for the following activities:
   A.   A permit review and inspection fee in accordance with the current fee
schedule for sewer permit shall be paid to the village at the time the
residential application is filed. Permit review costs for non-residential
permits will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the VE.
   B.   An inspection fee in accordance with the current fee schedule shall be
paid for any additional inspections. This includes but is not limited to
inspections of sampling manholes, flow metering or sampling equipment, garbage
grinders, grease, oil and sand interceptors, and grease interceptors.
   C.   Connection Fees: Title 13 shall be used for determining appropriate
fees to be paid for connections to the village sewer system.
      1.   For uses involving extra strength wastewater:
         a.   The VE may require industrial or commercial sewer users to report
to the VE concentrations and flow rates of wastewater discharged to the village
collection system. For wastewater the strength of which exceeds normal domestic
wastewater in any constituent the fees shall be based as follows. In the event
that the wastewater exhibits a ratio of BOD5 to COD of less than 0.3, the BOD5
population equivalent will be calculated on the basis of one third (1/3) of the
COD value. A permit connection fee then will be charged on the basis of the
impact on the POTW as the equivalent of the highest population equivalent of
the three (3) parameters: flow, BOD5, TSS or phosphorus.
         b.   When the volume and strength of the wastewater to be discharged
to the public sanitary sewers is not known at the time of the connection, the
fee shall be estimated and adjusted to reflect actual conditions during the
billing period just prior to a full year of operation.
         c.   The volume and strength of the wastewater for fee purposes shall
be the reasonable maximum daily discharge of constituents.
         d.   When a connection is made based on the applicant's statement that
the strength of the wastewater does not exceed normal domestic wastewater in
any constituent, and at the end of the billing period just prior to a full year
of operation it is determined that the wastewater does exceed domestic
wastewater in strength, the VE may accept or reject the wastes and backcharge
the applicant for fees plus penalties for the extra strength waste or have the
service disconnected and the premises closed.
   D.   Properties Outside Of Corporate Limits:
      1.   The connection fee calculated using the strength determination for
any user not located within the corporate limits of the village shall be two
(2) times the applicable connection fee listed in section
8-2C-2-3. On payment of the fee, the property baseline shall be adjusted to the
newly established PE. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-3-5: USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   A.   It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged to any
facility served by the village, without having first complied with the terms of
this chapter. At minimum, all users are subject to the prohibited discharge
standards in section
8-2-5-2 of this chapter, change notification in section
8-2-9-6 of this chapter and hazardous waste notification in section
8-2-9-9 of this chapter if applicable. Spill/slug control planning may also be
necessary for some non-residential users as identified in section
8-2-6-3 of this chapter. All non-residential users are subject to notification
of potential problems in section
8-2-9-7 of this chapter.
   B.   No user(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected
directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-3-6: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   An inspection fee as provided in section
8-2-3-4 of this chapter shall be paid to the village prior to issuance of the
permit should it be determined that the user is required to install any of the
following structures:
      1.   Sampling Manhole Requirements: All users located in areas zoned
industrial and such other users as required by the VE, except domestic users,
are required to install a monitoring manhole for each separate discharge in the
building sewer in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the
VE. Each manhole shall be situated on the user's premises in an easement
dedicated to the village.
      Where such a manhole location would be impractical or cause extreme
hardship on the user, the VE may concur with the manhole being constructed in
the public street or sidewalk area providing that the manhole is located so
that it shall not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. In those
cases where a sampling manhole must be in a parking lot, a permanent barricade,
such as a vertical pipe shall be placed around the manhole to prevent vehicles
from driving or parking over the manhole cover. A waiver for a sampling manhole
will be handled on case-by-case basis by the VE when it is determined that the
discharge is solely from a domestic source and the site is not in an area zoned
B-3, M-1, or M-2.
      The sampling manhole shall be located on the sewer connection pipe at a
point where there are no changes in grade or alignment for at least fifteen
(15) pipe diameters upstream and downstream from the manhole. The grade (slope)
of the pipe shall not exceed one percent (1%) (1 foot per 100 feet) through the
manhole and for a distance of fifteen (15) pipe diameters upstream and
downstream from the manhole.
      There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The manhole shall be
installed and maintained by the owner/user at his sole expense so as to be safe
and accessible to the village engineer at all times. The failure of a user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the
user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
      2.   Liquid Quantity Measurements: All significant industrial users may
be required to install an open channel flow measuring device in said sampling
manhole. When required, the sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus or
Parshall flume or equivalent, unless a weir or similar device is approved by
the village engineer.
      The village engineer may, at his option, based on the water usage and/or
waste loadings, require the user to install a device with a recording and
totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity. The device shall
include a circular chart recorder, suitable to record seven (7) days of flow.
The equipment required to indicate, record and totalize the flow shall be
located in a warm dry location and be accessible to the village engineer for
reading. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at his
sole expense. Should the requirement be made, the user shall complete
installation of the flume and secondary flow measuring device based on the
installation schedule approved for such device by the village engineer.
      The user shall be required to calibrate and maintain the flow metering
equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures and
frequencies. Users who operate flow measuring devices will submit the procedure
for operation and maintenance (O&M) to the village engineer. The user shall
further document O&M in a log which shall be available for inspection by
village engineer or his designee. At minimum, the user shall submit a semi-
annual calibration report performed by an outside representative by the
deadline defined in the user's discharge permit. The user shall submit flow
records to the pretreatment coordinator monthly.
      3.   Sampling Equipment: The village engineer may, at his option, based
on water usage and/or waste loadings or when the waste loads cannot be
accurately evaluated by time composite samples, require the user to install
sampling equipment. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the
user at his sole expense.
      Users shall submit the procedure for operation and maintenance to the
village engineer. The user shall further document O&M in a log which shall be
available for inspection by village personnel. At minimum, the user shall
submit an annual report confirming the accurate operation of the equipment
performed by an outside representative by the deadline defined in the discharge
permit. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-3-7: ADDITIONAL STRUCTURES REQUIRED FOR THE USE OF THE PUBLIC SEWERS:
   A.   An inspection fee as provided by section
8-2-3-4 of this chapter shall be paid to the village engineer prior to issuance
of the permit should it be determined that the user is required to install any
of the following structures:
      1.   Garbage Grinders: Garbage is required to be properly shredded in
order to be approved to be discharged to the public sewer. Wastes classified as
properly shredded garbage contain all particles being carried freely under the
flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particle greater
than one half inch (1/2" (1.27 centimeters)) in any dimension. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipped, with a motor of three fourths
(3/4) horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to review and
approval of the village engineer.
      2.   Grease, Oil, And Sand Interceptors: Interceptors shall be provided
in services connected to the village sewer system where it is determined that
they are necessary for the proper handling of the wastewater containing
excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand except that such interceptors
shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the village
engineer and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense.
      3.   Neutralizing Basins: Laboratory and facilities commonly using acid
or alkaline chemicals or compounds must install a neutralizing basin. All
basins shall be of type and capacity approved by the village and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such basins shall
be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his
expense.
      Equipment and devices installed under this section shall not be
considered to provide pretreatment to wastewater. Any user operating devices
installed in this section shall submit operating data as may be required by the
village.
   B.   Equalization And Pretreatment Equipment:

8-2-3-9: FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS:
   A.   Grease And Interceptors - Food Service Establishments (FSE): Hydro-
mechanical grease interceptors and gravity grease interceptors (collectively
referred to as grease interceptors or GI) are required to be installed in all
new FSE. The building department (BD) may require GI to be installed or
modified in existing FSE where FSE that have caused or contributed to overflows
and/or blockages, or at existing FSE that meet the remodeling requirements
identified in section
8-2-3-9 or when streetscapes or street/sewer replacements are installed.
      1.   Installation Requirements:
         a.   All newly constructed FSE's shall install an exterior GI prior to
operation of the facility.
         b.   Common interceptors are required to be installed when the tenants
or purchasers of sub-properties that are unknown by the complex owner and
zoning allows the build-out of an FSE in said properties. The owner of the
property on which the common interceptor is located shall be primarily
responsible for the maintenance, upkeep, and repair of the common interceptor.
         c.   Existing FSE: All existing FSE's may be required to install a GI
at the request of the BD. The BD may require a GI to be installed or modified
in an existing FSE within ninety (90) calendar days of notification by the
village where the FSE has caused or contributed to overflows and/or blockages,
when any reconstruction, rebuilding, or remodeling of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the building occurs, or when streetscapes or street/sewer replacements
are installed. The BD may require a new GI to be installed when the facility
has an undersized, irreparable, or defective GI. In the event that winter
weather will impact the installation of a GI, the BD may grant an extension of
the installation schedule to a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) calendar
days.
         d.   Existing FSE Where Hot Spots Or Blockages Have Occurred: GI's
will be required to be installed within ninety (90) calendar days of a notice
by the village if hot spots or blockages have occurred. GI's interior to the
building may be required as an interim measure to the installation of an
exterior GI. Such GI will be required to be installed within from five (5) to
thirty (30) calendar days, as determined by the BD based upon the nature of the
hot spot or blockage, after a notice by the village.
         e.   Waivers for installations at establishments only serving
beverages and snack bars with no food preparation other than food warming will
be handled on a case-by-case basis by the BD.
      2.   Location: All GI shall be so located to be easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. All GI will be provided exterior to the building for
all new construction and when feasible at existing FSE. The GI shall not be
located in drive-through lanes.
      3.   An inspection fee as provided by section
8-2-3-4 and found in section
8-2C-2-3 shall be paid to the village prior to issuance of the permit should it
be determined that the user is required to install any GI.
      4.   Sign-Off Inspection: Prior to the initial operation of any FSE, the
GI shall be inspected by the village and a sign-off will be issued by the
village. Notification will be made by the FSE to the BD during normal business
hours of the village. Inspections will be made normally by the village within
two (2) village business days of the notice. The FSE will be required to make
appropriate changes prior to initial operation, in the event that the GI does
not meet requirements.
      5.   Maintenance: Such GIs shall be inspected, the grease cap and solids
blanket cleaned every three (3) months, the entire contents of the trap cleaned
annually and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense. It
shall be the responsibility of the FSE to inspect its GI during the pumping
procedure to ensure the trap is properly cleaned out and that all fittings and
fixtures inside the trap are in working condition and functioning properly. In
the event that actual operations of the GI fail to produce results that
consistently prevent prohibitive discharges as defined in section
8-2-5-2 and/or meet the local limits in section
8-2A-2-1, the owner of the FSE will be required by the BD to have the GI
cleaned at a more frequent rate or install additional pretreatment as
necessary.
      6.   Modifications: The BD may make determinations of GI adequacy, need,
design, appropriateness, application, location, modification(s), and
conditional usage based on review of all relevant information regarding GI
performance, facility site and building plan review by all regulatory reviewing
agencies and may require repairs to, or modification or replacement of the GI.
      7.   FSE when required will be issued a general permit as provided by
sections
8-2-7 and
8-2-8.
   B.   Grease Interceptor Sizing Criteria: All GIs shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the BD based on an evaluation of the volume and
characteristics of the discharge in conjunction with the operating plan of the
FSE. Each GI will be sized so that it will continuously produce an effluent
that conforms with the local limits identified in section
8-2A-2-1. GI installed at new and existing FSE must meet the following
criteria:
      1.   The size will be determined by a formula approved by the village.
The minimum capacity of any individual FSE unit shall be five hundred (500)
gallons and the maximum capacity shall be one thousand five hundred (1,500)
gallons. Common interceptors may be required to be sized larger. Where
sufficient capacity cannot be achieved with a single unit, installation of GI
in series is required.
      2.   Twenty Five Percent (25%) Requirement: Provide for a minimum
hydraulic retention time of twenty four (24) minutes at actual peak flow
between the influent and effluent baffles, with twenty five percent (25%) of
the total volume of the exterior gravity GI being allowed for any food derived
solids to settle or accumulate and floatable grease-derived materials to rise
and accumulate, identified as a solids blanket and grease cap respectively.
      3.   Access Manholes: Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of twenty
four inches (24"), shall be provided over each exterior gravity GI chamber and
each sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade
and be designed to and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The
manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection,
grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities.
      4.   Prohibitions: Food waste disposal units shall not be connected to or
discharged into any GI. Dishwashers whose discharge has not been tempered to
less than one hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) are prohibited to be
discharged into any GI.
   C.   Waivers that are available to FSE are identified below. A request for a
waiver is required to be filed with the BD on a form provided by the village
and a waiver review fee will be required at the time of the filing as defined
in section
8-2C-3. Waiver requests are not considered to be filed until the request has
been reviewed and determined complete. If the BD fails to act on a completed
waiver request within forty five (45) calendar days, a request for waiver shall
be deemed to be denied. While waivers may result in an alteration of the GI
requirements, it does not waive the requirement to prevent prohibitive
discharges through alternate technologies and best management plan practices.
      1.   Existing External FSE GI Installation Waiver: The requirement to
install and to properly operate and maintain a GI is conditionally stayed, that
is, delayed in its implementation by the BD. Terms and conditions for
application of a stay to a FSE shall be set forth in a permit. The terms may
include the requirement to install GI(s) inside the facility, alternate
technology and the use of best management practices. The waiver will not apply
to any existing facility that has not operated as a FSE for the last twelve
(12) consecutive months prior to the adoption of this chapter. Such facilities
will be required to install a GI in order to operate a FSE in the village
sanitary sewer service area.
      2.   Common GI Waiver: Common GI means one or more interceptors receiving
FOG laden wastewater from more than one establishment. Common interceptors may
be used in lieu individual GI at each FSE provided a waiver has been granted by
the BD. A common GI may be located at shopping centers, malls, entertainment
complexes, sporting arenas, hotels, multi-tenant "flex" spaces, mixed use
spaces, and other sites where multiple establishments are connected to a single
GI. The owner of the property on which the common grease interceptor is located
shall be responsible for operating and maintenance of the common interceptor
including program documentation, upkeep, and repair. In such cases, a permit
will be issued to the property owner for the GI and general permits will also
be required at each FSE for best management practices requirements.
      3.   Limited Food Preparation Establishments GI Installation Waiver:
Waivers for installations at FSE only serving beverages and snack bars with no
food preparation other than food warming will be handled on a case-by-case
basis by the BD and are deemed to be limited food preparation establishments.
      4.   Constraint Waivers At Existing FSE: Where the installation of a GI
is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, a
waiver from the installation of the GI requirement may be granted. The BD
determination to grant the waiver will be based upon, but not limited to,
evaluation of the following conditions:
         a.   There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of
a grease interceptor;
         b.   There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between the kitchen
plumbing fixtures and the GI and/or between the GI and the private collection
lines or public sewer; or
         c.   A waiver from GI installation cannot be granted to allow
alternative pretreatment technology that is, at least, equally effective in
controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a GI.
      If a constraint waiver is granted, the DPW will institute the grease
disposal mitigation fee as defined in section
8-2C-2-3.
      5.   Alternate Technology Waiver: The use of automatic grease removal
systems is permissible only upon the written approval of the BD, and the lead
plumbing inspector of the village. Approval of the device shall be based on
demonstrated (proven) removal efficiencies and reliability of operation. The
village may approve these types of devices dependent on manufacturer's
specifications on a case-by-case basis. Any user operating an alternative
technology may be subject to additional operational requirements. Any user with
this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the
grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is
consistent achieved as required by the DPW.
      6.   Cleaning Cycle Waiver: The property may petition the BD to reduce
the cleaning and servicing of the GI from every three (3) months to a maximum
of every six (6) months upon demonstration that the amount removed every three
(3) months is significantly less than twenty five percent (25%) rule for the
basin capacity and the discharge does not exceed the oil and grease local limit
in section
8-2A-2-1. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-3-10: AUTOMOBILE SERVICE, REPAIR AND FUEL DISPENSING PROPERTIES:
   A.   When property use involves automotive repair or handling, sale and
dispensing of petroleum products and/or automotive fluids, all discharges shall
have installed a sampling manhole consistent with the requirements of section
8-2-3-7. All sampling manholes of this type shall be monitored throughout the
year in a manner secured and coordinated by the pretreatment coordinator.
Additionally, any property involved in the repair or servicing of automobiles,
trucks, or engine-powered equipment shall install a triple basin oil separator
in the sanitary line (per state of Illinois plumbing codes) servicing the
repair area of the building. This system shall be cleaned, serviced and
inspected at least four (4) times per year by the owner at his expense. The
property may petition the pretreatment coordinator to reduce the cleaning and
servicing of the triple basin oil separator to two (2) times per year upon
demonstration that the amount removed quarterly is significantly less than
twenty five percent (25%) rule for the basin capacity and the discharge does
not exceed the oil and grease local limit. Conversely, the system may be
required by the pretreatment coordinator to be cleaned at a more frequent rate
if the property cannot meet the requirements.
   B.   When property use involves automotive repair or handling, sale and
dispensing of petroleum products and/or automotive fluids, there shall be a
separate drainage system constructed to collect all fluids from the areas
associated with pump islands and under pump canopies. This separate drainage
system shall collect these fluids and hold them in a separate sealed tank for

reclamation processes. In no case shall a substance discharged to the village's
POTW cause the village to be in noncompliance with any biosolid use or disposal
regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; or any regulations
affecting biosolid use or disposal developed pursuant to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, Solids Waste Disposal Act, Toxic Substance
Control Act, or any state or local standards applicable to any biosolid
management methods either being used, or considered by the village;
      27.   Ammonia nitrogen in amounts that would cause a violation of the
water quality standards of the receiving waters of the POTW; or
      28.   Additives for the purpose of emulsifying or biologically/chemically
treating FOG for grease remediation or as a supplement to interceptor
maintenance that have a content of enzymes, surfactants or solvents that is
greater than ten percent (10%) of the volume without the written consent of the
pretreatment coordinator;
      29.   Any waste containing items that could clog or damage the village's

cleaning cloths, rags, paper towels, napkins, string, zip ties, laundry dryer
sheets, and any plastic products.
   D.   Wastes prohibited in this section shall not be processed or stored in
such manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All users with
prohibited wastes in this section or those that have hazardous wastes as
defined in section
8-2-9-9 of this chapter shall develop and implement a spill prevention/slug
control containment and countermeasures plan consistent with the requirements
in section
8-2-6-3 of this chapter. Notice requirements shall be permanently posted as
provided in section
8-2-9-7, "Reports of Potential Problems", of this chapter.
   E.   Requirements Of Polluted Discharges - Discharge Locations:
      1.   Discharge Of Polluting Substances From Fixtures Into Storm Sewers
Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person or user to connect or cause to
be connected, any drain carrying, or to carry, any toilet, sink, basement,
septic tank, cesspool, industrial waste, or any fixture or device discharging
polluting substances, to any storm sewer or storm water drainage system within
the corporate limits of the village.
      2.   Discharge Of Sanitary And Industrial Waste Into Storm Drainage
Systems Prohibited, Nuisance Declared: For reasons of the protection of the
health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the village, is the declared
policy of the village to prohibit sanitary and industrial waste from entering
into the storm water drainage system, and any such connection to the storm
water drainage system is determined to be injurious to the public health and
welfare and is hereby declared a public nuisance.
      3.   Prohibited Discharges into Natural Outlets: It shall be unlawful to
discharge into any natural outlet within the village or in any area under the
jurisdiction of the village, any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes or other
polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in
accordance with subsequent provisions of this chapter and the required permits
have been obtained.
   F.   Requirements Of Unpolluted Discharges:
      1.   Discharge Of Sump Pumps: A sump pump or sump pumps must discharge
into a storm sewer system; or with the prior written permission of the director
of public works (DPW) may discharge outside a building in an area first
approved by the DPW. A shut-off value or similar device which can divert the
unpolluted discharge from the sump pump into the sanitary sewer system, rather
than into the storm system, or vice versa, shall not be constructed or
installed, and any construction or installation of same shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter. It shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of
this chapter if any person or user has on his premises or under his control a
sump pump, or any other pump, fixture, or gravity drain connected to the
sanitary sewer system which would allow the flow of unpolluted water into the
sanitary sewer system.
      2.   Discharge Of Unpolluted Drainage Into Storm Sewers Or Natural
Outlets: Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural
outlet approved by the DPW. Industrial cooling waters or unpolluted process
waters may be discharged, upon approval by the DPW and the IEPA if appropriate,
to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
      3.   Discharge Of Unpolluted Discharges Upon Adjacent Property Or Public
Streets Or Ways Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person or user to
discharge any storm water, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, or
subsurface drainage, including the use of a sump pump for such purpose in such
manner as to cause waters to overflow onto adjacent property or to be
discharged upon any public street or public way. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-3: NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
These pretreatment requirements shall apply to all non-residential users
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, promulgated by the
USEPA in accordance with section 307(b) and (c) of the Act, currently
discharging or scheduled to discharge to the village. The national categorical
pretreatment standards, found in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405 -
471 are hereby incorporated into this chapter.
Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from
the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the
standard. Compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards is
mandatory.
   A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with subsections B and E below and 40 CFR Section 403.6(c) unless
specifically restricted by the categorical standard. These equivalent
limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements are deemed
pretreatment standards. Users shall be required to comply with the equivalent
limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived. An alternative pretreatment limit shall
not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit
for any of the regulated pollutants.
   B.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production, the village engineer
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users (see 40 CFR
Section 403.6(c)(2)).
   The village engineer, in calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations,
shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by
the user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be
based not upon the designed production capacity, but rather upon a reasonable
measure of the user's actual long-term daily production during a representative
year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected
production.
      The village engineer, in calculating equivalent concentration
limitations, shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations
by the average daily flow rate of the user's regulated process wastewater. This
average daily flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's
actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during
the representative year.
   C.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, pretreatment coordinator
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40
CFR Section 403.6(e) provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters to be
mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to issue an alternative
limit.
   D.   A user may request a variance from categorical pretreatment standards
from USEPA based on fundamentally different factors. The request must comply
with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR Section 403.13.
   E.   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the village convert the
limits to equivalent mass limits (see 40 CFR Section 403.6(c)(5)). The
determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the
discretion of the pretreatment coordinator. The village may establish
equivalent mass limits only if the user meets all the conditions set forth in
subsections E1a through E1e below.
      1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must:
         a.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its
individual wastewater discharge permit;
         b.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         c.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
         d.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to
control the discharge; and
         e.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for
equivalent mass limits.
      2.   A user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         a.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         b.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         c.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more
than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
subsection E1c of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate,
the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise
the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         d.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection E1a of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      3.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the pretreatment
coordinator:
         a.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         b.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
         c.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection
8-2-5-2B of this chapter. The user must be in compliance with section
8-2-16-3 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   F.   The pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment
coordinator.
   G.   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
   H.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four (4) day average, limitations.
Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure
shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent
limitations.
   I.   Any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the pretreatment coordinator with two (2) business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the pretreatment
coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.
   All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards
are required to file reports as required in section
8-2-9-2 and subsection
8-2-9-3B of this chapter, signed by an authorized representative. These reports
shall include all information that the village deems necessary to make
compliance determinations. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-4: STATE LIMITS:
   A.   All users are subject to state standards and requirements as defined in
35 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC) 307. Specifically, the standard for
discharge of mercury is as follows:
      1.   Mercury (35 IAC 307.1102):
         a.   Except as provided below, no person shall cause or allow the
concentration of mercury in any discharge to a publicly owned or publicly
regulated sewer system to exceed the following level, subject to the averaging
rule contained in 35 IAC 304.104(a):
 
CONSTITUENT STORET NUMBER CONCENTRATION
Mercury     71900         mg/1
                          0.0005
 
         b.   It shall be an exception to subsection A1a if the discharge is to
a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which is required to meet a
limitation less stringent than the 0.0005 mg/l mercury concentration in which
case the discharge limitation shall be the same as that applicable to the
publicly owned or regulated sewer system to which it discharges.
         c.   It shall be an exception to subsection A1a if all the following
conditions are met:
            (1)   The discharger does not use mercury; or, the discharger uses
mercury and this use cannot be eliminated; or, the discharger uses mercury only
in chemical analysis or in laboratory or other equipment and takes reasonable
care to avoid contamination of wastewater; and
            (2)   The discharge mercury concentration is less than 0.003 mg/l,
as determined by application of the averaging rules of 35 IAC 304.104(a); and
            (3)   The discharger is providing the best degree of treatment
consistent with technological feasibility, economic reasonableness and sound
engineering judgment. This may include no treatment for mercury; and
            (4)   The discharger has an inspection and maintenance program
likely to reduce or to prevent an increase in the level of mercury discharges.
         d.   The discharge of wastes from medicinal or therapeutic use of
mercury, exclusive of laboratory use, shall be exempt from the limitations of
subsection A1a if all the following conditions are met:
            (1)   The total discharge is less than 227 g (one half pound) as
mercury (Hg) in any year;
            (2)   This discharge is to a public sewer system; and
            (3)   The discharge does not, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, cause the effluent from the sewer system or treatment plant to exceed
0.0005 mg/l of mercury.
         e.   No person shall cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a
publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which, alone or in
combination with other sources, causes a violation by the sewer treatment plant
discharge of the water quality standard of 35 IAC 302 for mercury applicable in
the receiving stream.
         f.   For purposes of permit issuance the IEPA may consider application
of the exception of subsection A1b or A1c to determine compliance with this
section. The IEPA may impose permit conditions necessary or required to assure
continued application of the exception. When subsection A1b or A1c applies, the
IEPA may impose an effluent limitation in the permit which allows the discharge
of a concentration of mercury greater than 0.0005 mg/l but not more than 0.003
mg/l. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-5: LOCAL LIMITS:
The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through
and interference.
   A.   Non-Toxic Limits For Discharge: No user should discharge any wastewater
containing concentrations greater than the local limits as set forth in section
8-2A-2-1 of this chapter into any sewers that connect either directly or
indirectly to the POTW.
   B.   Toxic Pollutants: No user should discharge any wastewater containing
concentrations greater than the local limits as set forth in section
8-2A-2-2 of this chapter into any sewers that connect either directly or
indirectly to the POTW.
   C.   The village will apply the local limits found in subsections A and B
above normally at the end-of-pipe point where the non-residential waste is
discharged to the municipal sewer system.
   D.   Quantities And Rates Of Discharge: The village reserves the right to
establish requirements, by ordinance or in a wastewater discharge permit or
general permit, to require control over the quantities and rates of discharge
from any user.
   E.   Mass Limitations On Discharges: The village reserves the right to
establish, by ordinance or in a wastewater discharge permit, mass limitations
rather than concentration limitations on discharges particularly if users are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, or
in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   F.   The village reserves the right to set specific limits for those
pollutants not identified in sections
8-2A-2-1 or
8-2A-2-2 on a case by case basis for impacts caused to the POTW including but
not limited to interference, upset, pass through and prevention of beneficial
biosolids re-use. Those limits shall be set forth in a wastewater discharge
permit per section
8-2-8 of this chapter.
      1.   Local limits for additional pollutants not identified in sections
8-2A-2-1 or
8-2A-2-2 will be noticed to the permit holder a minimum of thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date of the wastewater discharge permit. In the event
that the village receives written comment on said limit during the comment
period, the limit will take effect within sixty (60) days of the public notice
date to allow review and comment by the village.
   G.   The village may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
local limits and the requirements of section
8-2-5-2.
   H.   Any user, whose discharge may be pre-treated or treated more
effectively and which discharges to the village's facilities that cause the
village's alteration of its method of wastewater treatment or biosolid disposal
to a more costly method, shall be assessed the differential cost between the
more costly method of treatment and the less costly method of treatment. Such
costs shall only be assessed upon approval of the village board. (Ord. 20-08-
25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-6: RIGHT OF REVISION:
The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-7: SAMPLING FACILITIES:
   A.   Applicability:
      1.   All non-residential users may be required to install a monitoring
manhole for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with
the plans and specifications approved by the village engineer and subsection
8-2-3-6A1 of this chapter.
         a.   When required by the village, a SIU or NSRU, that does not have a
unique sampling chamber at end-of-pipe, shall install a monitoring manhole or
sampling chamber for use as the regulation location of local limits in the
building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
village.
         b.   When required by the village engineer, a categorical industrial
user shall install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for the regulation
location of the categorically regulated discharge in the building sewer in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village. This sampling
chamber may be required to be installed within the building and may be in
addition to an end-of-pipe manhole.
      2.   The village reserves the right to apply said local limits in section
8-2-5-5 at an end-of process discharge location that connects to the POTW sewer
system in the event that:
         a.   A unique sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is not available;
         b.   A more representative sample can be taken of a process batch
discharge even though an end-of-pipe manhole exists;
         c.   A more representative sample can be taken at the end-of-process
location than the end-of-pipe location as a result of impacts from dilute
wastestreams;
         d.   An end-of process location is used because the IU is unable to
provide adequate flow documentation to use a combined wastestream formula.
      3.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist, the
"sampling manhole" shall be considered to be either the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected or the point of process wastewater discharge is accessible by the
village.
   B.   Wastewater Monitoring And/Or Flow Facility Operation And Maintenance:
      1.   Such facilities will be installed and maintained at all times at the
user's expense. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that the sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge. Installation will be consistent
with the requirements of section
8-2-3-6 of this chapter.
      2.   The manhole or chamber located on a building sewer discharge shall
be easily accessible to authorized representatives of the village twenty four
(24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week and shall be located in dedicated
easements.
      3.   The manhole or chamber for a categorical industrial user or
discharge location within the building shall be accessible to authorized
representatives of the village during normal operating hours.
      4.   Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if it
is substantiated to the village that the metered water supply and wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
village board of trustees is made in the metered water supply to determine
wastewater flow. In the event that the wastewater flow cannot be substantiated
at any regulated location, the user will be required to install flow monitoring
consistent with subsection
8-2-3-6A2 of this chapter.
      5.   The sampling chamber, flow metering device, sampling equipment and
documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analysis of
samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection by the village
engineer. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-8: MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: At minimum, all significant industrial users (SIU)
including categorical industrial users (CIU) as well as non-significant
regulated users (NSRU) are required to sample based on the village monitoring
frequency stated in the wastewater discharge permit. Other users are required
to sample upon the request of the village engineer. The users shall pay the
costs of sampling of its discharge and the costs of analyses of its samples,
whether or not the sampling and analyses are done by the user or by the POTW.
   B.   Frequency:
      1.   All SIUs including CIUs with wastewater discharge permits must
sample their effluent consistent with the permit requirements and report the
results to the POTW at least twice yearly. The village may specify more
frequent reporting, quarterly or monthly, dependent of the frequency for those
parameters specified in the user's permit and the village monitoring frequency
defined in the village's enforcement response Plan. The SIU may have the
village conduct routine monitoring using an independent laboratory. Sampling
visits of this type will normally be unannounced.
      2.   Any NSRUs with an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
shall sample their effluent and report the results to the POTW consistent with
the requirements of the wastewater discharge permit and the village monitoring
frequency.
      3.   Hauled waste and batch discharges that have been approved by the
pretreatment coordinator will have sampling and analysis as defined in an
individual wastewater discharge permit.
      4.   The village shall have the right to perform its own sampling at any
time at any location.
      5.   The village may resample a FSE within thirty (30) calendar days when
a violation of the twenty five percent (25%) requirement as defined in section
8-2A-2-3 is identified.
      6.   The village may initiate sampling and analyses at a greater
frequency as a result of a violation of any discharge permit limit, including
cases where hot spot maintenance issues or blockage to the sanitary sewer
system has occurred.
   C.   Sample Collection:
      1.   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the entire sampling and reporting period as defined
in the wastewater discharge permit.
      2.   Except as indicated in subsections C3 and C5 below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques.
      3.   In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
pretreatment coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling at
minimum collecting samples every fifteen (15) minutes during a twenty four (24)
hour workday; or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates
that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged. A proportional number of samples shall be collected for wastewater
discharges less than twenty four (24) hours.
      4.   Single grab samples may be required in the event of an infrequent
batch discharge or to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      5.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, hexavalent
chromium, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Multiple grab samples that
are individually preserved as specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate USEPA
guidance that are collected during a twenty four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis, as follows:
         a.   For, cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, and sulfides:
multiple grab samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
         b.   For volatile organics and oil and grease: multiple grab samples
may only be composited in the laboratory.
      6.   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
village, as appropriate.
   D.   Cost: The cost of village sampling and analysis for any monitoring will
be invoiced to the applicable user. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-9: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part
of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the pretreatment coordinator or other parties approved by USEPA. (Ord. 20-
08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-5-10: PROTECTION OF VILLAGE SAMPLING AND FLOW METERING EQUIPMENT FROM
DAMAGE:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which
is owned or contracted by the village. Any person violating this provision
shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. (Ord.
20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-6: PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER:
8-2-6-1: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
   A.   Each user that discharges non-residential source waste shall provide
wastewater treatment and best management practices as necessary to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section
8-2-5 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by USEPA, the
state, or the pretreatment coordinator, whichever is more stringent.
   B.   Any pretreatment facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment
coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the pretreatment coordinator
before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user for the responsibility of modifying
such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the village
engineer under the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements.
Users shall obtain all necessary construction-operating permits from the IEPA
prior to the village connection and/or discharge permit(s) being issued. IEPA
will make the determination of actual permitting requirements based on changes
in the wastewater volume or characteristics generated at the user site. The
village will track and parallel this IEPA permitting process. No sources of
non-residential wastewater will be allowed to discharge to village POTW until
all permitting requirements have been satisfied. Such pretreatment facilities
shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater
operator.
   D.   Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to the village and IEPA prior to the user's
initiation of the changes. Users shall obtain all additional construction-
operating permits from IEPA and the village for the changes prior to discharge.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-6-2: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
At minimum, the village may require the additional pretreatment measures
defined below. The village reserves the right to make unannounced inspections
of any additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours whether
the user has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
or not.
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the pretreatment coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may require any person or user discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow.
The village may issue an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
solely for flow equalization.
   C.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-6-3:  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLAN:
At minimum, all permitted non-residential users are required to develop and
implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan hereafter referred to a
spill plan. At least once every two (2) years the pretreatment coordinator
shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a revision to its
spill plan. The pretreatment coordinator may require any user to submit such
spill plan or require modification of an existing spill plan based on changes
that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident that had the
potential to impact the POTW. In alternate years, the pretreatment coordinator
shall evaluate whether each non-significant regulated user is required to file
a revision to its spill plan based on changes that have occurred at the site or
in response to an incident that had the potential to impact the POTW. Review of
such plans and operating procedures by the village engineer shall not relieve
the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility or spill plan as
necessary to meet all requirements of this chapter. Review by the village does
not constitute an approval of a spill plan and the village and its designee(s)
are not to be construed as responsible for the actions of the user and any
impacts the user may cause as a result of a spill or slug load. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
   A.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
   B.   Description of stored chemicals, including quantity of chemicals and
type and number of storage containers;
   C.   Site diagram showing location of all tanks holding greater than or
equal to two hundred fifty (250) gallons or areas containing eight (8) drums or
more of raw materials, prohibited wastes, hazardous wastes or final product.
Identification and location of all liquid materials, as well as locations of
drains to the sanitary sewer in the vicinity of the storage area(s), is
mandatory;
   D.   Procedures for immediately notifying the pretreatment coordinator of
any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section
8-2-9-7 of this chapter;
   E.   Location of notice/signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event
of a spill, accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug discharge or a
bypass of any part of a pretreatment system;
   F.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response. Building containment structures or production equipment changes are
considered procedures to prevent adverse spills. If containment structures are
connected to the sanitary sewer, a valve normally left in a closed position is
required;
   G.   Documentation to ensure that all employees who are in a position to
cause, discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency
notification procedures;
   H.   Documentation such as logs to verify inspection and maintenance
procedures to prevent adverse impacts and confirm that said procedures are
being performed on a regular basis must be maintained incorporated. Logs are
required to verify valves, if present, are closed in containment structures;
and
   I.   Emergency telephone number (twenty four (24) hour) off-site and backup
telephone number. If the spill plan has been submitted, any change in the
telephone numbers should be submitted within five working days when revised.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)

   D.   Categorical Monitoring Waivers:
      1.   Authority: Pursuant to 40 CFR Section 403.12(e)(2)(v) and (vi), the
village may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user.
This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are derived
from mass standards or production based standards. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         b.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
         c.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      2.   Application Requirements:
         a.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         b.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with section
8-2-7-6, and include the certification statement in section
8-2-7-6.
         c.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      3.   Documentation And Record Retention For CIU Monitoring Waivers:
      Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the pretreatment coordinator must
be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the
waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver
must be maintained by the pretreatment coordinator for three (3) years after
expiration of the waiver.
   Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-7-6:  INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL APPLICATION SIGNATORIES AND CERTIFICATION:
   A.   All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports,
certification statements and initial monitoring waivers must be signed by an
authorized representative of the user and contain the following certification
statement:
      "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the Person or Persons who manage
the system, or those Persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations".
   B.   If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of this section must be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator
prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-7-7:  INDIVIDUAL AND GENERAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DECISIONS:

engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation); the user shall identify whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.
   D.   Final Report: A final report will be filed with the pretreatment
coordinator by the user normally required within ninety (90) calendar days from
the end of the schedule deadline to verify the success or failure or the
schedule objective chosen by the user. The final report will, if appropriate,
identify the steps being taken by the user to resolve noncompliance. (Ord. 20-
08-25, 8-10-2020)

regulated as a categorical industrial user by standards and requirements
promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with section 307 (b) and (c) of the Act,
the following reports are required to be filed by the user with both the
village and USEPA in the event that the village does not have an approved
pretreatment program status from USEPA:
   A.   Baseline Monitoring Reports:
   Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR Section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later,
existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the POTW shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report
which contains the information listed below. At least ninety (90) days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report
which contains the information listed below. A new source shall report the
method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and
quantity of pollutants to be discharged.

significant non-categorical industrial user. In such cases, the village will
issue an attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the
village will perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum.
      4.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      5.   Where the village itself collects all the information required for
the report, the significant non-categorical industrial user will not be
required to submit the report.
   B.   Categorical Industrial Users:
      1.   All industrial users subject to a categorical pretreatment standard
(categorical industrial users) shall, at a frequency determined by the
pretreatment coordinator but in no case less than twice per year (in July and
January), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants
in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured
or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the
recommendation of the village engineer and in consideration of such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the village may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
section
8-2-7-6 of this chapter.
      2.   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge and comply with the
requirements of sections
8-2-5-8 and
8-2-5-9. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      3.   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu
of the categorical industrial user. In such cases, the village will issue an
attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the village will
perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum.
      4.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the pretreatment
coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in sections
8-2-5-8 and
8-2-5-9 of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report.
      5.   Where the village has imposed mass limitations on users as provided
for by 40 CFR Section 403.6(d), the report required by subsection B1 of this
section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the pretreatment
standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
      6.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the village in accordance with the procedures in subsection
8-2-5-3E of this chapter, the report required by subsection B1 of this section
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For
all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), the report required by subsection B1 of this section shall
include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      7.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      8.   Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for pollutants found to be not
present and revision of the user's permit by the pretreatment coordinator, the
user must certify on each periodic report with the statement in section
8-2-7-6, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the User with the following statement:
      "Based on my inquiry of the Person or Persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______(specify
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard part(s)), I certify that,
to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level
of the _________(list the categorically regulated Pollutant(s)) in the
Wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic report."
      9.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection
8-2-9-3B1 or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
pretreatment coordinator, and notify the pretreatment coordinator.
   C.   Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users:
      1.   Non-significant categorical industrial users as defined in section
8-2-1-7 shall, at a frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator but in
no case less than twice per year (on dates specified by the village) submit a
report which contains the certification statement contained in subsection C3
below and a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the
pollutants required to be reported by the village.
      2.   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling
and analysis may be performed by the village in lieu of non-significant
categorical industrial user. In such cases, the village will issue an
attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the SIU has
determined the village will perform sampling and analysis semi-annually. Where
the village itself collects all the information required for the report, the
non-significant categorical industrial user will not be required to submit the
report.
      3.   Certification Statement: A facility determined to be a non-
significant categorical user by the pretreatment coordinator must annually
submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the
signatory requirements in section
8-2-1-7 of this chapter.
      "Based on my inquiry of the Person or Persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
___, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the
period from _____________,________ to _____________,________ (months, days,
year):
         a)   The facility described as ________________________ _________
(facility name) met the definition of a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial
User as described by Section
8-2-1-7;
         b)   The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards
and Requirements during this reporting period; and
         c)   The facility never Discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical Wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
      This compliance certification is based on the following information:
      ______________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
________________________________________"
      4.   The report is required to be signed by an authorized representative
of the user.
   D.   Other Non-SIU Regulated Users:
      1.   Categorical zero process dischargers, non-categorical zero process
dischargers, batch dischargers, FSE and any firms regulated by individual or
general permit requirements including but not limited to BMP shall, at a
frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator, submit a periodic report
as defined in their wastewater discharge permits.
      2.   The reports may require sampling and analyses or some other measure
to determine compliance with permit pretreatment standards and requirements.
The user must submit documentation necessary to determine the compliance status
of user as defined by the pretreatment coordinator and identified in the
wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-9-4: AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE CHANGE NOTIFICATION:
Any significant industrial user which changes the authorized representative of
its company as defined in section
8-2-1-7 of this chapter shall file a change notice with the village within
thirty (30) calendar days. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-9-5:  REPORTS FROM NON-PERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the pretreatment coordinator as required. These reports
include but are not limited to surveys of business activities, water usage,
wastes discharged, spill and slug loading potential, pretreatment equipment,
waste hauling and facility layout. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-9-6: REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS:
Each user must notify the pretreatment coordinator of any planned substantial
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) calendar days before
the change that results of an increase or addition or planned shutdown or
deletion of products. Immediate shutdowns or deletions of products are required
to be noticed within five (5) working days of determination.
   A.   The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
section
8-2-7-5 of this chapter.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may issue an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit under section
8-2-7-7 of this chapter or modify an existing individual or general wastewater
discharge permit under section
8-2-8-4 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
   C.   For purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, the addition
or deletion of a shift, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants
including changes to the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which
user has submitted initial notification under section
8-2-9-9 of this chapter, introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring
waiver had been obtained, the addition of a new process regardless of waste
discharge or lack of discharge, shutdown of a process, or addition or deletion
of a product.
   D.   Significant industrial users and categorical industrial users are
required to immediately notify the pretreatment coordinator of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-
10-2020)
8-2-9-7: REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
   A.   Initial Notification: In the case of any discharge, including, but not
limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic
nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, any user shall immediately telephone (within
fifteen (15) minutes), and notify the pretreatment coordinator of the incident.
If this notification cannot be made to the POTW staff during routine business
hours, the user shall notify the village police department. This notification
shall include the location of the discharge, physical state of discharge,
chemical composition, concentration and volume, if known, and date and time of
discharge as well as duration of the discharge, and corrective actions taken by
the user. The notification shall include what federal, state and local entities
have also been notified by the user.
   B.   The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   C.   Written Notification: Within five (5) working days following such
discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the pretreatment coordinator,
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and
the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. The
report may also include further defined dates when updates or progress reports
will be submitted for activities not completed at the time of the written
notification.
   D.   Notification Not A Relief Of Liability: Such notifications shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
chapter.
   E.   Employee Notification Procedure: A notice/sign shall be permanently
posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection A, above. Employers shall ensure through
documentation that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-9-8: NOTICE OF VIOLATION; REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
pretreatment coordinator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within thirty
(30) calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not
required to resample if the pretreatment coordinator monitors at the user's
facility at least once a month, or if the pretreatment coordinator samples
between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of
this sampling. If the village performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of
the user, the village will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it
notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
sampling and analysis. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-9-9: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Pursuant to 40 CFR Section 403.12 (p) any user who commences the
discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the USEPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred
(100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification
also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180)
calendar days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section
8-2-9-6 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections
8-2-9-2A, C, and 8-2-9-3B of this chapter.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A, above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR Section 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR Section 261.30(d)
and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
      1.   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
pretreatment coordinator, the USEPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) calendar days of the effective date of such
regulations.
      2.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      3.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-9-10: REPORT SUBMITTAL DUE DATES:
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.
For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern. In order to meet deadlines, reports may be faxed on the due date
to the village. The original of the fax is required to be mailed to the village
postmarked within one (1) working day of the fax. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-10: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
8-2-10-1: RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The pretreatment coordinator and his designee(s), duly authorized agents of the
village, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as above named entities,
shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the
user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual or
general wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the above named entities ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, analyses,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the above named entities will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The village shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated twice yearly (at six (6) month intervals) to ensure their
accuracy. The user shall submit these calibration reports semi-annually to the
village with the periodic compliance reports required in section
8-2-9-3 of this chapter.
   D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the pretreatment coordinator and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the pretreatment coordinator and his
designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-10-2: RECORD KEEPING:
   A.   Users: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established under
section
8-2-8-2 of this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method,
and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the
dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the village, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the pretreatment coordinator.
   B.   Village: The village will maintain documentation of any monitoring
waiver issued per subsection
8-2-7-5D of this chapter for a period of three (3) years after the expiration
of the waiver. The documentation will include the reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver. (Ord.
20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-10-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the pretreatment coordinator has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the pretreatment coordinator may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of Lake County as
appropriate. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-11: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual or general wastewater discharge
permits, and monitoring programs, and the pretreatment coordinator inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator and village attorney, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR Section 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-12:  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE:
8-2-12-1: PUBLICATION FREQUENCY:
The pretreatment coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous
twelve (12) months, were in significant non-compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant non-compliance
shall be applicable to all significant industrial users and categorical
industrial users (or any other user that violates subsections
8-2-12-2C, D or H below. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-12-2:  SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE DEFINITION:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits as defined in section
8-2-5;
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits as defined by section
8-2-5 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by section
8-2-5 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the pretreatment coordinator has determined caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the pretreatment
coordinator exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, that the pretreatment coordinator determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-13: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
These remedies apply to the provisions of this chapter and to the local limits
provisions of article A of this chapter. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-13-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
   A.   When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of this notice
an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the pretreatment coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may initiate a pretreatment review meeting
for any violation issued under subsection
8-2-13-1A of this chapter but most likely for the first violation of any
parameter. The village shall schedule a pretreatment review meeting, normally
within thirty (30) calendar days of the determination that a meeting is
required.
   C.   As a result of a pretreatment review meeting, the village may issue a
compliance directive stating that the user is in a "corrective action" status.
A plan for correction and compliance schedule illustrating milestones may be
issued by the village to the user. This plan for correction and compliance
schedule may become part of the user's permit. The user is responsible for
meeting the permit limits at all times. The plan for correction, compliance
schedule and revised permit do not relieve the user of meeting the permit
limits and/or ordinance requirements. The user shall take whatever actions are
necessary to meet the permit limits and permit conditions.
   D.   As a result of a violation, the village may continue to sample the user
and inspect the user's progress towards meeting milestones as needed to
determine if the user is complying with the conditions of the plan of action,
compliance schedule and/or permit. In the event the village detects and
documents any violation; a NOV will be issued to the user.
   E.   Each detected violation of the plan of action, compliance schedule, and
permit, will result in an NOV being issued to the user. When NOV #3 (total of
three (3) NOVs) is issued, a "ticket" may be issued to the user, authorized
representative per article 1-6C of this code. The ticket is a legal notice
requiring the user to appear in court, either Lake County Circuit Court or
Village Adjudication Court per section
8-2-14-2 of this chapter. The village may charge assessments to the user as
provided for in this chapter.
   F.   When the user has met the conditions of the plan of action, compliance
schedule, and permit, the village will notify the user in writing that the
conditions have been satisfied and they are no longer under a "corrective
action" status if such a status was formally issued.
   G.   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the pretreatment
coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 20-08-
25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-13-2: COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS:
The pretreatment coordinator may enter into compliance agreements, assurances
of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action
to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time-period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
8-2-13-4 and
8-2-13-5 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 20-08-25,
8-10-2020)
8-2-13-3: SHOW CAUSE ORDER:
The pretreatment coordinator may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the village board and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten (10) working days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-13-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
pretreatment coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-13-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
pretreatment coordinator or village attorney may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-
10-2020)
8-2-13-6: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The pretreatment coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
pretreatment coordinator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment
coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The pretreatment
coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
section
8-2-13-7 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment coordinator prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections
8-2-13-3 or
8-2-13-7 of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-13-7: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in section
8-2-13-6 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in section
8-2-5 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
8-2-13-3 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the pretreatment coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-
10-2020)
8-2-14: PENALTIES AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
These penalties apply to the provisions of this chapter and to the local limits
provisions of article A of this chapter. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-14-1:  RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED:
Any entity violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or who causes
damage to or impairs the village's POTW shall be liable to the village for any
expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The village may
invoice the costs, including but not limited to, sampling and analyses
associated with the investigation, costs of mitigating impact to the POTW,
costs of preparing the administrative enforcement actions such as notices and
orders; investigative and/or correction actions, and review of response(s) from
the user. In the event of damage, losses or impairments, the village engineer
or treasurer shall bill the entity for the costs incurred by the village for
any cleaning, repair, replacement or other investigative and/or corrective
actions as a response to the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the
assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter enforceable under
the provisions of section
8-2-13 of this chapter.
Recovery of costs incurred also includes but is not limited to the following
provisions specific for food service establishments (FSE):
   A.   Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee: FSE that operate without a grease
interceptor (GI) May be required to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation
fee to equitably cover the costs of increase maintenance of the sewer system as
a result of the FSE's inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater
discharge. This section shall not be interpreted to allow the new construction
of, or existing FSE undergoing remodeling to operate without an approved GI.
      1.   The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be established in section
2C-4-2 and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining
the sewer system for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or
solidifying agents attributable to the FSE resulting from the lack of a grease
interceptor or grease control device.
      2.   Sewer System Overflows, Public Nuisance, Abatement And Cleanup
Costs: Notwithstanding the waiver of grease interceptor installation for
existing FSE established in section
8-2-3-9, FSE found to have contributed to a sewer blockage, sewer system
overflows (SSOs) or any sewer system interferences resulting from the discharge
of wastewater or waste containing FOG may be subject to costs incurred by the
village's established in section 2C-4-2. SSOs may cause threat and injury to
public health, safety, and welfare of life and property and are hereby declared
public nuisances. Furthermore, sewer lateral failures and SSOs caused by FSE
alone or collectively, are the responsibility of the private property owner or
FSE, and individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE. If the
village must act immediately to contain and clean up an SSO caused by blockage
of a private or public sewer lateral or system serving a FSE, or at the request
of the property owner or operator of the FSE, or because of the failure of the
property owner or FSE to abate the condition causing immediate threat of injury
to the health, safety, welfare, or property of the public, the village's costs
for such abatement may be entirely borne by the property owner or operator of
the FSE, and the individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s)
and may constitute a debt to the village and become due and payable upon the
village's request for reimbursement of such costs. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-14-2:  ALTERNATIVE ADJUDICATION HEARING PROCESS:
The pretreatment coordinator in conjunction with the village attorney as
defined in article 1-6C of this code shall have the discretion to direct any
process involving the civil fines and penalties set forth in this subchapter to
the administrative hearing process described in article 1-6D of this code. Upon
the filing of any action before the administrative hearing officer, he or she
shall have plenary powers to levy all civil fines and penalties, to decide and
continue cases and to take all other quasi-judicial steps which are consistent
with the grant of powers given in said article D. However, consistent with the
limitations on the grants of powers that can be devolved onto such hearing
officers, the administrative hearing officer shall have no jurisdiction to levy
any criminal fine or to issue any form of injunction, restraining order or
other extraordinary remedy. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-14-3: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition the Circuit Court of
Lake County as applicable through the village attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual or general wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The pretreatment coordinator may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-14-4: CIVIL PENALTIES:
When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition the Circuit Court of
Lake County through the village attorney for civil penalties as follows:
   A.   Any user shall be subject to the imposition of a civil penalty in at
least the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) a day for each violation.
In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The pretreatment coordinator may recover costs, including but not
limited to, filing fees, witness fees, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
village.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by
the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-
2020)
8-2-14-5: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The pretreatment
coordinator may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the village's enforcement response plan. However, the
pretreatment coordinator may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the pretreatment coordinator is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 20-
08-25, 8-10-2020)

(Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-15-2:  PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The pretreatment coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, an individual or general previous wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to
the village, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the pretreatment
coordinator to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. (Ord. 20-08-25,
8-10-2020)
8-2-15-3:  LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The pretreatment coordinator may decline to issue or reissue an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, a previous individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused
by its discharge. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-15-4:  WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, an individual or general wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to
the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense,
only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply and
paid outstanding costs, fees and penalties. The user shall pay the entire
expense incurred by the village for the shut off and restarting of service
before the water will be turned on again. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-15-5:  PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other

pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of
the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-16: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
8-2-16-1: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment
coordinator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written report must be provided within
five (5) working days):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-
2020)
8-2-16-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection
8-2-5-2A of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in subsections
8-2-5-2C1 through C26 (excluding subsections C2, C9 and C17) of this chapter if
it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference or that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the village was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements. (Ord.
20-08-25, 8-10-2020)
8-2-16-3: BYPASS:
   A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
 
BYPASS:                 The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
                        portion of a user's treatment or pretreatment facility.
                        Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
                        treatment facilities which causes them to become
                        inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
                        occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
                        damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in
                        production.
 
   B.   Bypass Allowances: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Bypass Notifications:
      1.   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten (10)
working days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      2.   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment
coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) working
days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   POTW Actions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The pretreatment coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the pretreatment coordinator
determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection D1
of this section. (Ord. 20-08-25, 8-10-2020)

the tax dollars contributed from property taxes paid by village residents, the
fee schedule on file with the parks director may set forth two (2) levels of
fees: one charged to nonresidents and a discounted fee offered to residents.
For the purpose of the assessment of fees, and for the simplicity of
administration by the parks department, any person with a postal zip code of
60002 is considered a resident and anyone else is considered a nonresident. The
parks department may request photo ID or other proper identification in
determining the amount of fees to charge any person. The parks director may, in
conjunction with the joint management of shared parks pursuant to the

      4.   The village board reserves all other power to waive any fees on a
case by case basis upon petition therefor.
   C.   Refund Policy: No refunds will be granted unless a program is canceled
or changed by the parks and recreation department. In certain cases of
hardship, consideration can be given by the parks director and will take into
account the specific effect on the program the refund is requested for.
   D.   Discount Policy: The parks director shall provide a ten percent (10%)
discount on selected designated programming for multichild registrations to
families in the same program. The discount will only apply when registering for
programs within the same time frame and it will be deducted from the least
expensive program participant. Proof of family relationships and residency in
the same household may be required. (Ord. 16-05-14, 5-16-2016)

places shall be entirely cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other
debris resulting from such work. All cleanup operations at the location of such
excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be
completed to the satisfaction of the superintendent of public works. From time
to time, as may be ordered by the superintendent of public works and in any
event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at his
own or its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of
any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within twenty four
(24) hours after having been notified to do so by the superintendent of public
works, said work may be done by the village and the cost thereof charged to the
permittee and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the
surety bond provided herein. (1976 Code § 95.009)
   D.   Supervision: The superintendent of public works shall from time to time
inspect all excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street or
other public place in the village to see to the enforcement of the provisions

CHAPTER 6
TREES AND VEGETATION
SECTION:
8-6-1: Findings And Purpose
8-6-2: Definitions
8-6-3: Tree Replacement Fund
8-6-4: Replacement Standards
8-6-5: Violation And Penalty
8-6-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Findings And Determinations: The following are hereby found and
determined:
      1.   It is the public policy of the village to replace, by replanting,
trees within the village that are removed in the course of constructing public
improvements including extended grading areas in new subdivisions or planned
unit developments (PUDs).
      2.   Trees contribute to the scenic beauty of the village and increase
property values while enhancing the quality of the life within the village.
      3.   The replacement of trees, wooded areas and wildlife habitat provides
desired environmental effects.
      4.   The replacement of trees within the village is necessary in order to
safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and
promote the public welfare. To promote the foregoing and for the good of future
generations, it is necessary to require a tree replacement program which will
assure the proper replacement of trees and cover for birds and wildlife, at
quantities greater than the trees and vegetative cover removed due to site
development. (1976 Code § 100.01)
      5.   Proper site grading is perhaps the single most important
consideration in saving trees during construction. Mass cuts and fills are
responsible for more tree loss in construction areas than any other single
factor. Mass cuts and filling shall be discouraged and grading or density
variances can be used to encourage the preservation of woodland or blocks of
tree stands.
      6.   Tree conservation is recommended and will be encouraged when proper
engineering practices are followed, as accepted by the village engineer. When
proper grading, water detention and the installation of public improvements
needed to prevent flooding, sewer backup, use of ejector pumps and the like
requires removal, tree replacement shall be required.
   B.   Purpose: The purpose and intent of this chapter is not to discourage
development, nor restrict an owner's right to use his property, but to ensure
that existing healthy mature trees are preserved. It is further a goal of this
chapter to ensure more trees exist in the village after a development is built
than before. The goal of this chapter will be to ensure it is less expensive to
save existing trees than to provide replacement trees. Healthy mature trees can
only be saved through cooperation between the village and the developer/owner.
The burden of identifying those trees to be saved and those trees targeted for
removal and replacement rests with the developer and no building permit shall
be issued until the village zoning officer certifies conformance with this
chapter. (Ord. 01-10-29, 11-5-2001)
8-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
BUILDING PERMIT: A permit issued by the village for the construction of public
improvements and site grading.
CONSTRUCTION AREA: The area on a development site where earthmoving is
contemplated for the construction of public improvements including extended
grading areas.
dbh: The diameter of a tree measured at breast height, or four feet six inches
(4'6") above the ground.
dbh CATEGORIES: Category 1, trees with a dbh of 10 inches to 19.9 inches
Category 2, trees with a dbh of 20 inches to 29.9 inches
Category 3, trees with a dbh of 30 inches or greater
DEVELOPER: A person applying for plan approval and/or building permit for a new
subdivision or new planned unit development.
DRIP LINE: The area under a tree determined by measuring the longest horizontal
branch of that tree and using that measurement as the radius and the trunk as
the center, the circular area of land under the tree is defined as within the
drip line.
EXTENDED GRADING AREAS: The public rights of way and those areas extending
beyond the rights of way and easements for public improvements where, in
keeping with accepted engineering practices, grading should be extended beyond
such road rights of way and easements. Should the extended grading areas extend
beneath the drip line of any healthy mature tree, then that tree shall be
included in the number of trees to be replaced regardless of its chance of
survival. Any healthy mature tree designated for replacement due to an extended
grading area shall be given all possible chance for survival at the
developer's/owner's expense. Extended grading areas shall not be granted for
the sole purpose of placing buildings on individual lots. Easements not
included in the extended grading areas where trees remain shall be excluded
from the tree replacement requirements of this chapter.
MATURE TREE: Any tree with a dbh of ten inches (10") or greater.
OWNER: Joint tenancies, trusts, beneficiaries under wills and trusts,
corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, lessors, lessees, agents,
executors, assigns and the like.
PARCEL: All contiguous land in one ownership.
REPLACEMENT TREES: Any tree not listed in subsection
8-6-4C of this chapter, or "wildlife planting" as defined in this section.
RIGHT OF WAY: Those areas dedicated to the village which may include streets,
roads, boulevards, curbs, gutters or sidewalks.
SITE DEVELOPMENT: The altering of the terrain, removal of trees and/or
vegetation and construction of public improvements thereon including the
extended grading areas.
SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN: The final plan of subdivision or planned unit
development (PUD), showing the public improvements including any extended
grading areas.
VILLAGE: The village of Antioch, Lake County, Illinois.
WILDLIFE PLANTING: One clustered planting of the following: one white pine; one
burr oak; one gray dogwood; one black cherry; one American plum or any species
recommended by the Illinois department of conservation. Wildlife plantings are
suggested for edging of wetlands and property boundaries to create hedgerows
for animal habitat. (1976 Code § 100.03; amd. Ord. 01-10-29, 11-5-2001)
8-6-3: TREE REPLACEMENT FUND:
See section
13-1-10 of this code. (Ord. 05-12-27, 12-19-2005)
8-6-4: REPLACEMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Objective: The objective of this chapter is to protect healthy mature
trees within the village, replace trees as necessary and provide wildlife cover
in areas disturbed by site development within the village. Measures taken to
protect trees and wildlife cover shall assure that existing trees and wildlife
cover shall be saved to the greatest extent possible. The intent of this
chapter is minimizing loss of healthy mature trees and wildlife cover through
protective measures, careful planning and tree replacement. This chapter shall
apply to all new subdivisions and PUDs not currently approved by the village
board, and may be considered as a condition for approval of any special use or
variance submittal.
   B.   Tree Protection:
      1.   As part of a final plan submittal, the planning and zoning board
shall require the developer/owner to submit a detailed tree survey and a tree
preservation plan at the expense of the developer. Failure to submit these
items shall constitute a valid reason to reject a petition or withhold approval
until such items are available to the planning and zoning board.
      2.   During construction, all reasonable steps necessary to prevent
damage or the destruction of a tree designated a healthy mature tree shall be
taken. These steps will include:
         a.   No soils shall be removed or disturbed within an area around the
drip line, which is determined using the following formula: one foot (1') out
in horizontal distance for each inch of the tree's diameter. This area will
start at the drip line and extend outward (calculated drip line area).
         b.   A protective fence approved by the village engineer with
appropriate signage shall be erected around any tree designated a healthy
mature tree.
         c.   Any tree which is designated a category 3 (DBH) or is
specifically identified as a tree of significant value by the village board
shall be reviewed for possible deep root feeding and extraordinary steps for
preservation which may include stoppage of work as directed by a vote of the
village board until an arborist can be contacted, at the developer/owner's
expense, to develop a plan to attempt to ensure the tree can be saved.
Developers are encouraged to plan their open space areas, tot lots and
recreational areas around these trees.
         d.   Proper site grading is perhaps the single most important
consideration in saving trees during construction. Mass cuts and fills are
responsible for more tree loss in construction areas than any other single
factor. Mass cuts and filling shall be discouraged and grading or density
variances may be considered to encourage the preservation of woodland or blocks
of tree stands.
         e.   Tree conservation is recommended and will be encouraged when
accepted engineering practices are followed, as accepted by the village
engineer. When proper grading, water detention and the installation of public
improvements needed to prevent flooding, sewer backup, use of ejector pumps and
the like require removal, tree replacement will be required.
         f.   Healthy mature oak trees are to be singled out for extra care and
attention during the grading process to ensure that their root systems are not
damaged. The calculated drip line area (subsection B2a of this section) may be
adjusted outward upon the recommendation of a certified arborist and the
approval of an authorized representative of the village.
         g.   Variances for slopes greater than three to one (3:1) can be
considered subject to village engineer approval.
         h.   The developer/owner is responsible to ensure that all applicable
subcontractors are trained on proper tree protection.
         i.   No excess soil, additional fill, equipment, trailers, liquids or
construction debris shall be placed within the calculated drip line of any tree
that is to remain at its original location.
         j.   Only protective nondamaging devices or attachments shall be
attached to any tree during construction, and only following written approval
from the village mayor or an authorized village representative.
   C.   Prohibited Replacement Trees:
      1.   Replacement trees shall not include the following:
         Austrian pine
         Box elder
         Catalpa
         Mountain ash
         Mulberry
         Poplar
         Siberian elm
         Soft maple
         Tree of heaven
         Willow
Any tree determined unacceptable by the village board upon recommendation of
the building department. (Ord. 01-10-29, 11-5-2001)
      2.   Replacement trees located in a parkway or right of way, as defined
in section
8-6-2 of this chapter, shall be installed and maintained according to the
provisions set forth in this chapter. (1976 Code § 100.12)
   D.   Replacement Trees:
      1.   Planting: Replacement trees shall be planted in accordance with the
following schedule:
 
DBH Category Number Of Replacement Trees
1            3
2            4
3            6
 
Where there are few or no trees within a development, a minimum of five (5)
trees per acre on average shall be planted in all zoning districts. Replacement
trees in the evergreen classification shall have minimum height of twenty four
inches (24") to thirty six inches (36"). Replacement trees in the deciduous
classification shall have a minimum height of sixty inches (60") to seventy two
inches (72"). Wildlife plantings shall have no minimum height requirements and
one wildlife planting shall equal one replacement tree. Replacement trees or
wildlife plantings, depending on the weather, shall be planted in the spring of
the year following the removal of the trees to be replaced. (1976 Code §
100.13)
      2.   Location: In development where open areas or park areas are
provided, it is recommended that replacement trees be planted in clusters, or
that wildlife plantings be planted as a hedgerow to provide buffers. In
developments where, due to good forestry practices, the planting of replacement
trees is not advised, the developer/owner shall cause to be planted, on public
property, the required replacement trees, at the direction of the building
official or as directed by the village board. (1976 Code § 100.14)
   E.   Trees In Developments:
      1.   Development Proposals: All final plans of subdivisions and PUDs
approved by the village board shall include, on a separate sheet, by phases of
development, a list of the number and DBH category of all mature trees within
the road rights of way, easements and extended grading areas, as defined in
section
8-6-2 of this chapter, and indicate which of those trees lying therein are to
be removed. This list shall be certified by the developer's engineer or
surveyor and shall be used to determine the number of trees or wildlife
plantings to be planted as replacements. It is the intent of this chapter that
each phase of a development be considered separately and individually as to its
compliance.
However, a developer/owner may plant replacement trees at the current time in
any phase of a multi-phase development if he has met tree replacement
requirements for the current phase. If the developer/owner wishes to plant
required trees in other phases at a later date, he shall deposit in escrow two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per replacement tree.
      2.   Removing Trees Prior To Development:
         a.   Any person removing or destroying any healthy mature tree within
thirty six (36) months prior to the submission of a development plan shall be
subject to a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per mature
tree removed or destroyed. All fines shall be kept in a separate village tree
replacement fund for the sole purpose of tree replacement. In addition, each
healthy mature tree so destroyed or removed shall be replaced with new trees at
triple the required replacement.
         b.   If any healthy mature tree designated for preservation during
site development is destroyed or removed, it shall be replaced with new trees
at triple the required replacement. (Ord. 01-10-29, 11-5-2001)
         c.   In a planned unit development (PUD), in lieu of the standards in
this chapter, a site specific tree preservation and replacement plan may be
approved by the village board of trustees in connection with the approval of
the PUD; provided that, unless the village board of trustees determines
otherwise, the tree replacement formula in subsection D1 of this section shall
apply to any site specific tree preservation and replacement plan. If a site
specific tree preservation and replacement plan is approved for such a PUD,
except for the tree replacement formula in subsection D1 of this section, the
standards of this chapter shall not apply to that PUD, and there shall be no
further tree survey or tree preservation review by the plan commission or
village board. If a site specific tree preservation and replacement plan is not
approved by the village board of trustees, then all the standards of this
chapter shall be applicable. A site specific tree preservation and replacement
plan may be approved at the time of approval of a preliminary PUD plan. (Ord.
02-08-26, 8-27-2002)
8-6-5: VIOLATION AND PENALTY:
Anyone who violates this chapter shall be fined not less than twenty five
dollars ($25.00) nor more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each
offense in addition to providing the replacement trees as outlined in this
chapter. Each healthy mature tree removed or destroyed in violation of this
chapter shall be considered a separate offense and each day the violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. The per tree fine for removal
or destruction of healthy mature trees in violation of this chapter shall be
reduced proportionately from maximum to minimum based upon the extent to which
the average diameter of replacement trees approaches the diameter of the tree
that was removed or destroyed in violation of this chapter, with the minimum
fine being reserved for those instances in which the average diameter of the
replacement trees equals or exceeds the diameter of the mature tree removed or
destroyed in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 01-10-29, 11-5-2001)

similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable

village of Antioch representatives in attendance as the village of Antioch
deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work
under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas
where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of
other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid
disruption of other utilities, use of rights of way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
   D.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
village of Antioch does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the village of Antioch and applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations. (Ord. 09-12-41, 12-7-2009)
8-7-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village of Antioch within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section
8-7-21 of this chapter. If the village of Antioch denies the request for a
variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of
way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised
drawings or plans therefor. (Ord. 09-12-41, 12-7-2009)
8-7-8: INSURANCE:

fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to
arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts,
omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction
of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering
service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct
or breach of this chapter by the village of Antioch, its officials, officers,
employees, agents or representatives. (Ord. 09-12-41, 12-7-2009)
8-7-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village of Antioch
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village of Antioch
issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village of Antioch may pay or incur by reason of
any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village of
Antioch must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the
village of Antioch from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other
applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village of
Antioch in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the village of Antioch, or an unconditional letter of credit
in a form acceptable to the village of Antioch. Any surety bond or letter of
credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village of Antioch and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of Antioch of any amounts covered by it; and

provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the village of Antioch engineer, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village of Antioch estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village of Antioch, with each phase
consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of
locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
village of Antioch engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each
phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for
phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village of Antioch, upon fourteen (14) days' advance
written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village of
Antioch for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals
may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village of Antioch for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the village of Antioch has been compelled to pay or
incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
of Antioch determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village of Antioch that any amount has been withdrawn from the
security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount
specified in subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village
of Antioch, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village of Antioch,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the
minimum balance required in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village of Antioch for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the village of Antioch to the extent
necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village
of Antioch as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess
of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village of Antioch with
respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village
of Antioch, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law,
and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security
fund shall affect any other right the village of Antioch may have.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village of Antioch shall not be entitled to
a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be
infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 09-12-41, 12-7-2009)

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village of Antioch engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free

may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the village of Antioch engineer may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village
of Antioch engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right
to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the

of Antioch will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and
this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village of Antioch's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining,
modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the
permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a
permit related cost apportionment of the village of Antioch. Sanctions may be
imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 09-

have lapsed, or upon written notification from the covenant administrator,
whichever is first, the permit shall enter into the review process pursuant to

10-4-5: VARIANCES:
   A.   Intent And Purpose: A variance is a grant of relief to a property owner
from the literal requirements of the zoning ordinance where literal enforcement
would cause undue hardship. Additionally, a variance is intended to provide
relief where the requirements of this title render the land difficult to use
because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other
factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested. A variance
is not intended merely to remove an inconvenience or financial burden that the
requirements of this title may impose on a property owner. A variance is not
intended to allow the establishment of a use that is not otherwise allowed in a
zoning district or that would change the zoning district classification of any
or all of the affected property, and should not be granted where a special use
permit or an amendment to the official zoning map would be more appropriate.
   B.   Initiation Of A Variance: A request for a variance may be initiated by
either:
      1.   The owner of the subject property; or
      2.   A contract purchaser of the subject property.
   C.   Application For Variance: An application for a variance shall be filed
in writing with the zoning administrator and shall include a map of the
property showing its dimensions, all streets and alleys, and other properties
within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the property. The zoning administrator
shall transmit the application to the zoning board of appeals for review and
public hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing within
sixty (60) days after filing of the application.
   D.   Notice And Conduct Of The Public Hearing: The notice for and conduct of
the public hearing shall be in accordance with the public notice requirements
of this title.
   E.   Findings And Recommendations: The zoning board of appeals shall make
findings of fact based on evidence presented to it and forward the findings
with recommendations to the village board.
   F.   Standards For A Variance: The ZBA shall not recommend, and the village
board shall not grant, a variance from the regulations of this title unless it
makes findings based on evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this title;
      2.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and thus
strict enforcement of this title would result in practical difficulties or
impose exceptional hardships due to the special and unusual conditions that are
not generally found on other properties in the same zoning district;
      3.   The property cannot yield a reasonable use if permitted only under
the conditions allowed by this title; and
      4.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property.
   G.   Burden Of Proof For Variance: In each case of a requested variance, the
applicant must satisfy the proof that the proposed variance meets the standards
of division F of this section, even if there is no testimony or other evidence
opposing or rebutting the requested variance.
   H.   Village Board Actions On A Variance: Within forty five (45) days of the
completed public hearing the village board shall review the findings and
recommendations of the zoning board of appeals. The village board may grant,
deny, or grant with modification the proposed variance. If the village board
grants the variance, it shall make findings of fact specifying the reasons for
the variance in accordance with the standards of division F of this section.
Additionally, if granting the variance, the village board shall adopt an
ordinance approving the application. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-4-6: ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS:
   A.   Authority: The zoning administrator is authorized to make
administrative adjustments, except as expressly prohibited in division D of
this section, providing that in each case the criteria of division B of this
section are met, as follows:
      1.   Maximum building height: up to five percent (5%) over the maximum;
      2.   Minimum setbacks: up to five percent (5%) of the minimum; and
      3.   After-the-fact encroachments into yards: up to one foot (1').
   B.   Criteria: The zoning administrator shall not authorize an
administrative adjustment unless the following criteria are satisfied:
      1.   The requested administrative adjustment is consistent with the
stated intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance;
      2.   The requested administrative adjustment eliminates an inconvenience
to the applicant and will have no appreciable adverse impact on the health,
safety, or general welfare of the surrounding property owners or general
public; and
      3.   Any adverse impacts resulting from the administrative adjustment
will be mitigated to the maximum extent feasible.
   C.   Procedure: The property owner, or agent, shall submit to the zoning
administrator the following:
      1.   A map or elevation, as appropriate, depicting the difference between
the zoning ordinance standard and the requested adjustment;
      2.   A statement on why the adjustment is necessary and why, if granted,
it would meet the criteria of division B of this section.
   D.   Prohibited Adjustments: The zoning administrator shall not make an
administrative adjust for a planned development or special use. (See section
10-15-4 for administrative adjustments to planned developments.) (Ord. 19-12-
43, 1-13-2020)
10-4-7: APPEALS:
   A.   Right To Appeal: An appeal may be made by any person, firm, or
corporation, or by any officer, department or board of the municipality
aggrieved by the action of the zoning administrator.
   B.   Procedure For Appeals: An appeal may be taken from any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the zoning administrator. The appeal
shall be made within forty five (45) days of the action by filing with the
zoning administrator and with the board of appeals a notice of appeal. Upon
receipt of the notice of appeal, the zoning administrator must forward to the
zoning board of appeals all papers which constitute a record of the action that
is being appealed.
   C.   Effect Of The Appeal: A filing of a complete notice of appeal stays all
further proceedings unless the zoning administrator certifies to the ZBA, after
the appeal is filed, based on the facts stated in the certification/affidavit,
a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In this event, the stay
may be effectuated only by an order of the zoning board of appeals or by a
court of record.
   D.   Public Hearing: No more than thirty (30) days after the filing of a
complete notice of appeal, the zoning board of appeals shall hold a hearing to
consider the appeal. The notice for and conduct of the public hearing shall be
in accordance with the notice requirements of this title.
   E.   Decision Of The Village Board: The zoning board of appeals shall
transmit to the village board its written findings and recommendations of the
appeal within a reasonable time, but in no event more than sixty (60) days
after the filing of the notice of appeal, and shall promptly forward a copy of
the decision to the parties concerned. The village board may affirm or may
reverse, in whole or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the zoning administrator. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-4-8: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   Authority: The village board, after receiving findings and
recommendations from the plan commission, may amend the regulations of this
title or amend the boundaries of the official zoning map.
   B.   Initiation Of Amendments: Text amendments may be initiated by the
mayor, village board, plan commission, or zoning administrator. Official zoning
map amendments may be initiated by the village board, plan commission, zoning
administrator, owner of the property, or contract purchaser of the property.
   C.   Application For Map Amendment: An application for an amendment of the
official zoning map shall be filed in writing with the zoning administrator and
shall include a map of the property showing its dimensions, all streets and
alleys, and other properties within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the
property. The zoning administrator shall transmit the application to the plan
commission or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate, for review and public
hearing. The plan commission shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days
after filing of the complete application.
   D.   Notice And Conduct Of Public Hearing: Notice for and conduct of the
public hearing shall be in accordance with the public notice requirements this
title.
   E.   Official Zoning Map Amendments (Rezoning): The plan commission shall
not recommend, nor shall the village board grant, an amendment altering the
zoning district boundary lines unless it shall find, based on the evidence
presented to it in each specific case, that:
      1.   The amendment promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience and general welfare, and complies with the policies and official
plans of the village;
      2.   The trend of development in the area of the subject property is
consistent with the requested amendment;
      3.   The requested zoning classification permits uses which are more
suitable than the uses permitted under the existing zoning classification;
      4.   The property cannot yield a reasonable use if permitted only under
the conditions allowed under the existing zoning classification; and
      5.   The amendment, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property.
   F.   Decision Of The Village Board: After recommendation by the plan
commission, the village board may grant, deny, or grant with the modification,
the amendment, or may refer the proposed amendment back to the plan commission
for further consideration. If the village board grants the amendment, it shall
adopt an ordinance approving the amendment. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-4-9: SPECIAL USES:
   A.   Purpose: The development and execution of this title is based upon the
division of the village into zoning districts within which the use of land, and
the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are
substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses that, because of their
unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any district or
districts, without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses on
adjacent properties and of the public need for the particular use in the
particular location. Case by case review is intended to ensure consideration of
the special use's anticipated land use, site design, and impacts.
   B.   Initiation Of A Special Use: A special use application may be filed by
the owner or contract purchaser of the property.
   C.   Application For Special Use: An application for a special use shall be
filed in writing with the zoning administrator and shall include a map of the
property showing its dimensions, all streets and alleys, and other properties
within two hundred and fifty feet (250') of the property. Applications for a
planned development shall be in accordance with the provisions of chapter 10-15
of this title. The zoning administrator shall transmit the application to the
plan commission, as appropriate, for review and public hearing. The plan
commission or zoning board of appeals, as appropriate, shall hold a public
hearing within forty five (45) days after filing of a complete application.
   D.   Notice And Conduct Of Public Hearing: Notice for and conduct of the
public hearing shall be in accordance with the notice requirements of this
title and state statute.
   E.   Standards For Special Uses: The plan commission shall not recommend,
nor the village board grant, a special use unless it shall make findings of
fact based on the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate area for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish property values with the neighborhood; and
      2.   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the adjacent properties for uses
permitted in the subject zoning district.
   F.   Burden Of Proof For Special Use: In each case of a requested special
use, the applicant must satisfy the proof that the proposed special use meets
the standards of division E of this section, even if there is no testimony or
other evidence opposing or rebutting the requested special use.
   G.   Decision Of The Village Board: After recommendation by the plan
commission, the village board may grant, deny, or grant with modification the
special use, or may refer the proposed special use back to the plan commission
for further consideration. If the village board grants a special use, it shall
adopt an ordinance authorizing the special use.
   H.   Conditions And Restrictions:
      1.   When the special use is determined to have the potential for adverse
impacts, the plan commission may recommend, and the village board may impose
conditions on the approval to ensure that the adverse impacts will be
mitigated. Such conditions may include impositions on the site planning,
design, location, and operation of the special use.
      2.   The zoning board of appeals may recommend, and the village board of
trustees may impose, such restrictions on the height, bulk and area of
occupancy of any structure so approved for special use as may be reasonable
under the particular circumstances. Off-street parking facilities as well as
off- street loading and unloading spaces may also be stipulated in the order
permitting the special use, and all other codes and ordinances of the village
must be complied with. Special uses relating to recreational cannabis require
compliance with the procedures outlined in the recreational cannabis mercantile
regulations, chapter 10-19 of this code.
   I.   Lapse Of Approval And Discontinuance: An ordinance approving a special
use is valid for twelve (12) months from the date of the ordinance unless a
building permit is obtained, or the use is commenced. If a building permit is
not obtained or the use is not commenced within such time, the approval for
special use will lapse and shall become null and void. If a special use is
discontinued for a period of six (6) months or longer, the special use shall be
considered abandoned and shall become null and void. Reinstatement or re-
establishment of the special use will require approval pursuant to the
provisions of this section. The provisions of this division do not apply to
planned developments.
   J.   Amendments To Special Use: A change in the area, bulk, size, use or
intensity of use of an existing special use, or a change to the conditions
specified for a special use at the time of approval, shall be deemed the same
as a new special use and shall require approval pursuant to the provisions of
this section. (Ord. 19-12-44, 12-19-2019; Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)

notice, the owner of the property on which the notice is served cannot be found
at the owner's last known address, or mailed notice is returned because the
owner cannot be found at the owner's last known address, then the requirement
for written notice of that owner will be deemed satisfied.

10-6-1: ZONING DISTRICTS:
The residential districts ("R districts") are primarily for residential land
uses and for other selected uses that are deemed compatible with residential
environments. The various residential districts are intended to maintain and
promote a variety of housing types within the village.
   A.   Estate District: This zoning district is intended to create a semi-
rural environment that is appropriate for large estate lots on a minimum of
five (5) acre lots, while also allowing room for equestrian activities. As
reflected in the village's comprehensive plan, the eastern perimeter of the
village should be preserved for large estate lots with single family homes.
   B.   Suburban Estate District: This district is appropriate for developments
with a density of between one (1.0) to one and one half (1.5) per acre.
Generally, the homes will be located on lots ranging from thirty thousand
(30,000) to fifty thousand (50,000) square feet. These developments will
incorporate a semi-custom product and the location of schools, religious
assemblies, and other local services may be appropriate.
   C.   R-1 Single-Family Residential District: This district is intended to
provide areas for low density, single-family detached housing on lot sizes with
a minimum of twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. Compatible government,
religious, educational, and recreational uses may be permitted within the
district. This zoning district corresponds, approximately, to the low-density
residential land use category in the village's comprehensive plan. Residential
density is intended to between 2.1 to 2.5 dwelling units per acre if a part of
a PD.
   D.   R-2 Single-Family And Two-Family Residential District: This district is
intended to provide areas for a mix of single-family detached housing and two-
family attached housing on lot sizes with a minimum of nine thousand (9,000)
square feet. A limit of two (2) dwelling units per lot shall be maintained.
Compatible government, religious, education, and recreational land uses may be
permitted within the district. This zoning district corresponds, approximately,
to the medium density residential land use category in the village's
comprehensive plan. Residential density is intended to range between 2.5 to 3.0
units per acre.
   E.   R-3 Townhouse/Multiple Family District: This district is intended to
provide areas for a variety of housing types at medium densities. Townhomes,
rowhouses, duplexes, and apartments are appropriate for this district.
Compatible government, religious, education, and recreational uses may be
permitted within the district. This zoning district corresponds to the density,
but not necessarily location, of the village residential land use category in
the village's comprehensive plan. Residential density is intended to be a
maximum of ten (10) dwelling units per acre.
   F.   Downtown Form Based Code District: This district encompasses the
existing downtown and the area covered by the "Downtown Form Based Code". The
area includes Main Street and the "Transitional Core" along Main Street. This
area reflects the historic core of Antioch and generally reflects a Pre-World
War II development pattern of interconnected streets, mixed use, compact
development, mature neighborhoods that are pedestrian friendly and walkable to
Main Street in Downtown Antioch.
   G.   TND Traditional Neighborhood District: This district is intended to
regulate new development with more traditional forms of neighborhood pattern
outside the village's downtown form based district. It allows various housing
types: single-family, duplex, rowhouse, and townhouse. The TND district
reflects the Pre-World War II development pattern that is pedestrian friendly,
walkable, incorporates a diverse number of both residential and commercial uses
within a fifteen (15) minute pedestrian shed. Other uses include civic uses,
including library, government offices, parks, and schools. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-

10-7-4:    Cannabis Conditional/Special Uses
10-7-1: ZONING DISTRICTS:
The business districts ("B districts") are intended primarily for retail,
service, and commercial land uses. The various business districts are intended
to maintain and promote a variety of commercial activities within the village.
   A.   B-1 Neighborhood Convenience District: This district is intended to
provide convenience shopping for persons living in adjacent residential areas.
Permitted uses are those that satisfy basic daily or frequent shopping needs.
The district is also intended to promote pedestrian access to shopping and
services. This zoning district corresponds, approximately, to the smaller areas
planned for general commercial use in the comprehensive plan.
   B.   B-2 Highway Business District: This district is intended to accommodate
a broad range of retail, service, and commercial uses, and allows for the
highest intensity of such uses. Unlike the other business districts, where
pedestrian travel to and from the commercial activity is encouraged, virtually
all patrons will arrive by automobile. This zoning district corresponds to
larger tracts planned for general commercial land use in the village's
comprehensive plan. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-7-2: STANDARDS FOR THE B DISTRICTS:
   A.   Specific Standards For B Districts: Specific minimum and maximum
standards for lots, buildings and yards in the B districts are listed in
division D, business district standards, of this section.
      1.   Setback Buffer: All structures on the B-zoned lot must be setback a
distance that is equal to or greater than the setback requirement for the R-
zoned lot. If the B-zoned property abuts two (2) different R districts, then
the greater setback shall apply.
      2.   Landscape Buffer: A landscape buffer must also be maintained. This
buffer shall extend the length of the lot line or segment of the lot line that
abuts the residential district and shall be at least forty feet (40') wide and
planted with landscaping that provides one hundred percent (100%) opacity. No
landscaped buffer is required where a street, alley, railroad or other public
right of way that is at least ten feet (10') wide separates the B-zoned and R-
zoned lots.
      3.   Buffer Restrictions: The landscape buffer landscape buffer shall not
be used for the purposes of parking, loading, servicing, or storage.
      4.   Screening: Permanent opaque walls or opaque fences at least four
feet (4') in height or densely planted shrubbery or plant material at least
four feet (4') in height must be maintained. Chain-link fences may not be used
to comply with this screening requirement. Additionally, the village board may
require a fence in cases where it finds that plant material is insufficient to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the adjacent landowners and
occupants.
   B.   Outdoor Operations: All business, service and commercial activities
must be conducted within completely enclosed buildings unless otherwise
expressly allowed in
10-7-3, or this section. This requirement does not apply to automated teller
machines, or to off-street parking and loading or drive-through operations that
are otherwise permitted by this title. The village board may waive this
provision by designating certain days on which special promotions may be
conducted outside the building.
   C.   Outdoor Dining And Drinking: On-site outdoor seating areas for the
patrons of eating and drinking establishments are allowed as an accessory use
so long as the establishment complies with any permitting requirements that the
village, from time to time, may establish.

10-10-1: INTRODUCTION:
The intent of this downtown Antioch form based code is to help set the
foundation for a set of guiding principles that will foster a vibrant,
pedestrian friendly, mixed use, transit oriented downtown. This chapter will
outline and establish new development regulations for streets, blocks, and
buildings that emphasize "building form", "public realm" and high quality site
and building design in each of the distinct downtown districts.
This chapter shall act as a component to this title and shall be administered
pursuant to the ordinances and regulations of the village of Antioch in
compliance with the laws and statutes of the state of Illinois.
In order to clearly organize this chapter, a regulating plan has been developed
(see figure 1.1 of this section). The downtown Antioch regulating plan outlines
five (5) distinct character districts within the greater downtown area. These
districts include:
   Village core (VC)
   Transitional core (TC)
   Main Street transitional (MT)
   Business park (BP)
   Commercial edge (CE)
Additionally, areas of open space (OS) are found throughout the downtown area.
While not its own unique district, preservation, enhancement and improvement to
existing and new open spaces should be provided throughout downtown Antioch.
A more detailed discussion, illustrations of future target development sites
and urban design standards are addressed in the following sections.
Additionally, an outline of permitted and special land use categories is
included per district.

(Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011)
10-10-2: REGULATING FRAMEWORK PLAN:
   A.   Purpose: The regulating framework plan defines the desired physical
form for downtown Antioch and sets development/building parameters such as land
use, building height, massing, siting and setbacks and parking placement and
ratios. This chapter incorporates not only the vision of the regulating plan,
but also applies to, and regulates, parcels not specifically referenced in the
plan.
Figure 2.1, "Downtown Antioch Target Opportunity Sites", of this section
highlights downtown opportunity sites identified in the transit oriented
planning/design process. For illustrative purposes, figures 2.2 and 2.3 of this
section show the potential desired build out of these sites. These plans
reflect the goals and objectives of the regulating plan and serve as a guide
for village officials, property owners, and developers as they move forward
with approving and implementing these projects within downtown.

   B.   Applicability: This chapter applies in the following instances:
      1.   Any new development/construction;
      2.   If the primary use within a building changes;
      3.   Exterior rehabilitation projects that involve the following: 1)
change to exterior materials; 2) window alterations or replacement; 3) change
in roofline; 4) exterior structural changes; 5) storefront alterations.
As mentioned, the regulating framework plan helps define physical form of the
urban space. More specifically, the components that must be considered when
developing, rehabilitating or renovating within each of the districts include:
allowed land use, building height, building placement/massing and parking and
servicing. (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011; amd. Ord. 22-05-30, 5-25-2022)
10-10-3: USES; HEIGHT; PARKING AND SERVICING:
   A.   Allowed Uses: Permitted and special use considerations are shown in
table 1, "Allowed Uses", of this section for each district defined in the
regulating plan. Allowed uses are discussed further by district in sections
10-10-5 through
10-10-9 of this chapter.

*   Personal service and office, administrative, professional, and medical uses
shall equate to no more than an aggregate twenty-eight percent (28%) of the
uses allowed at any given time in the Village Core District on Main Street
(Route 83) between Lake Street and Orchard Street.
While uses can be "mixed" within buildings by floor in some districts as noted,
residential and commercial (retail, service, or office) uses cannot be mixed on
the same floor in a building (i.e., a floor containing housing units cannot
contain retail, office or service uses), unless it is determined by the Village
Administrator that there are no impacts of mixing uses on the same floor to
public health, safety and welfare.
For new development, a residential lobby is required on the ground floor in all
buildings with residential uses on upper floors. Commercial uses on the first
floor may have a secondary entrance from this lobby as long as the primary
commercial entrance is from the sidewalk on the street. Rehabilitation projects
that change the use to a public facility must meet all Americans With
Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. All standards set forth by the Illinois
Accessibility Code and Federal guidelines apply for all new development
regarding access in multi-story mixed use and residential buildings. The chief
building official will have the ability to review and approve departures in
conformance with the Illinois Accessibility Code.
Parking is allowed on the ground floor behind commercial uses in buildings with
retail, service or office uses on the ground floor.
   B.   Height: Base allowed heights are defined by district in sections
10-10-5 through
10-10-9 of this chapter.
      1.   Additional Height: In addition to the maximum height listed for each
district, a bonus of up to ten feet (10') can be added to the height of a
building to allow for such architectural features as pitched roofs and parapet
walls that enhance or benefit the building architecture or streetscape
presence.
      2.   Architectural Features And Rooftop Accessory Structures:
Architectural features or rooftop accessory structures, such as heating and
ventilation equipment and antennas are not counted as stories. All heating,
ventilation and similar rooftop equipment must be fully screened and enclosed
in an architecturally sympathetic enclosure not to exceed ten feet (10') in
height. Any such enclosure must be set back a distance of at least ten feet
(10') from any front or side building wall and not visible from street level.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2902.gif]
 
For all buildings, an additional bonus of ten feet (10') (beyond the 10 feet
allowed for pitched roofs and parapet walls) may be allowed in specific
circumstances to provide space for an interesting architectural feature such as
a clock tower or a cupola. The floor area of the feature shall not constitute
more than ten percent (10%) of the building's ground floor area.
      3.   First Floor Commercial Uses: The first floor of a commercial
building must have a minimum floor to ceiling height of fifteen feet (15') and
a maximum floor to ceiling height of twenty feet (20').
      4.   One-Story Commercial Buildings: For one-story commercial buildings,
the minimum height is twenty feet (20') and the maximum height is twenty two
feet (22') to provide an increased physical presence and shopping "streetwall".
      5.   Decks/Terraces: Active use is permitted on terraces created by
building stepbacks. Decks or terraces are permitted on rooftops or above
enclosed ground floor parking. All decks or terraces shall be designed per
village safety codes and regulations.
   C.   Parking And Servicing: Parking for new development shall be provided
for each use according to the following ratios:
      1.   Minimum Parking By Use:
 
Apartments/condominiums         1.5 spaces per unit
Nonresidential under 2,000 s.f. None
Office                          1 space per 400 gross square feet
Restaurant                      1 space per 400 gross square feet
Retail/service                  1 space per 400 gross square feet/none for VC
                                and TC districts
Townhomes/row homes             2 spaces per unit
 
All existing buildings are "grandfathered" in, unless it is determined that a
new use will bring a negative parking impact to the surrounding district.
      2.   Shared Parking:
         a.   Collective Provisions: Shared parking shall be considered to
minimize the visual impact of land devoted to parking and to provide more
efficient parking downtown.
         b.   Location: All required parking spaces shall be on the same lot as
the building or use being served or within six hundred feet (600') of the
property line, provided that no off street parking for a business use shall be
in a residential district. Shared parking opportunities shall be considered for
all uses within the downtown area. Where feasible, use of METRA surface lots
may be considered for evening and weekend off peak periods and special events.
Shared parking with METRA is encouraged as long as the uses are compatible and
do not conflict with the times commuters would use them.
         c.   Waiver: The village administrator may waive the number of spaces
required in part or entirely if shared parking is deemed efficient based on the
location of the proposed use, anticipated hours of peak parking demand,
potential for shared parking, and availability of alternative parking. A
written agreement or parking management plan covering such collective use shall
be filed with the village department of planning and zoning.
      3.   Servicing: All service areas should be hidden from view, not located
on primary or main street frontages, screened with solid masonry screen walls
or year round landscape buffer. Minimum loading/services and trash collection
standards must be met per existing code requirements. All loading/services
areas shall be well lit to maintain a safe environment per existing village
codes and regulations. (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011; amd. Ord. 18-05-18, 5-14-
2018; Ord. 21-11-41, 11-10-2021)
10-10-4: ZONING DISTRICTS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: All downtown special district parcels have been
assigned a designation to define an optimal "building envelope" and "public
realm" using setbacks, sidewalk and street widths, as well as other design
parameters.
Along with section
10-10-10, "Urban Design Standards", of this chapter, the required street,
sidewalk and building relationships are intended to foster new development that
enhances and expands the traditional "Main Street" scale of downtown and builds
upon the potential for transit oriented development around the train depot.
New development, as well as rehab projects, should also refer to the following
village documents for guidelines related to the public realm: "Village Of
Antioch Urban Design Manual", village of Antioch street graphics and village
landscaping, signage and lighting standards. Where there is a conflict between
this chapter and these documents, the more restrictive standard will apply.
As illustrated in section
10-10-1, figure 1.1, "Downtown Antioch Regulating Plan", of this chapter five
(5) distinct districts have been identified that establish the location and
relationships of the districts.
      1.   Build-To Zone: The build-to zone is an area that helps establish
consistent "streetwalls", sidewalk widths and streetscape zones.
The relationship of the build-to zone to the public right of way or property
line is that the build-to zone may differ from the current location of the
right of way or property line. In these cases the apparent rights of way/
property lines will need to be adjusted through dedication of property between
the property owner and village. More specifically, the property owner may need
to dedicate property to the public right of way to create the desirable street
and streetscape width, or the village may transfer right of way to the
buildable development site.
Over time, desired or common sidewalk widths will be established to create a
more regular walking experience from block to block that incorporates a minimum
five foot (5') "free zone" walking area and additional space for street trees,
parkways or outdoor seating.
For Main Street, the build-to zone is intended to eventually bring all
buildings more in line with a fifteen foot (15') sidewalk width primarily found
in the village's core shopping district between Orchard Street and Lake Street/
Park Avenue.
For Orchard Street, Lake Street and Toft Avenue, the build- to zone is intended
to eventually eliminate parking lots in front of buildings and bring buildings
closer to the sidewalk to better frame the street, reduce its perceived width
and scale and establish these roadways as physical extensions of the
traditional village core along Main Street. This chapter also incorporates
standards for the frontages of residential buildings, including apartment
buildings and row homes/townhomes along these streets as compatible uses within
the downtown area.
For primarily residential and industrial districts, the building line may not
be the primary indicator of future development form, where instead consistent
street and pedestrian zone treatments and building setbacks will drive the
form.
   B.   Zoning Districts Defined: The five (5) designations of downtown Antioch
zoning districts as outlined in the introduction are (see section
10-10-1, figure 1.1, of this chapter):
      VC - Village core: Downtown's primary pedestrian oriented shopping
district with the highest intensity of buildings and main activity center.
Personal service and office, administrative, professional, and medical uses
shall equate to no more than an aggregate twenty-eight percent (28%) of the
uses allowed at any given time in the Village Core District on Main Street
(Route 83) between Lake Street and Orchard Street.
      TC - Transitional core: Parcels, many of which are undeveloped and
include the redevelopment opportunity sites, adjacent to the village core with
frontages on Main, Lake and Orchard that have potential to become an extension
of the village core's mixed use character. This district also includes Depot
Street and areas around the METRA station.
      MT - Main Street transitional: Surrounding residential primarily north
and south of the village core along IL-83/Main Street. This district consists
of both single- family and multi-family housing, as well as educational/
institutional uses. The MT district consists of parcels which are seen as areas
where change of land uses may or should occur in a controlled environment that
architecturally and physically blends with the mixed use retail/service
character of downtown.
      BP - Business park: The large manufacturing district east of the tracks
where the regulating plan and form based goals focus and encourage physical
improvements of streetscapes and the pedestrian environment.
      CE - Commercial edge: Commercial districts both north and south comprised
predominantly of auto oriented uses. This chapter seeks to improve the physical
environment of the area over time.

(Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011; amd. Ord. 21-11-41, 11-10-2021)
10-10-5: VILLAGE CORE DISTRICT - VC:
   A.   Description: The village core district - VC is intended to protect the
character of downtown Antioch's traditional pedestrian oriented shopping
streets, primarily Main Street between Orchard Street on the north and Wilton/
Ida on the south. It also covers a portion of Lake Street closest to Main.
These areas are characterized by relatively low scale commercial buildings
between one and three (3) stories in height on small lots. Retail, commercial
and service uses predominantly activate the street level/first floor pedestrian
environment. The VC district is intended to protect and enhance the existing
historic character at the heart of Antioch's village center and to accommodate
redevelopment that is in keeping with this character in terms of use, height,
scale and detail.
The village core district, shown in red, is located around Antioch's
traditional shopping streets

The VC district is intended to protect and enhance Antioch's historic
character.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2908.gif]
 
   B.   Use:
      1.   Ground Floor: As defined by zoning, only retail sales, service uses,
entertainment uses (e.g., eating and drinking establishments), and commercial
office uses may be located on the ground floor of buildings in the VC per local
zoning and building code.
      2.   Above The Ground Floor: Any combination of allowed retail,
commercial, office, personal service or residential is allowed per local zoning
and building code.
   C.   Height: Building height limits in the VC are established to ensure
reasonable, predictable limits on maximum building height and preserve the low
rise pedestrian shopping street character of the designated village core
district. The maximum allowed building height in the VC district is forty five
feet (45').
      1.   Context Sensitivity: When considering additions, renovations or new
development within the VC, it is imperative that new building heights and
facades carefully balance and "fit" within the streetwall character. New
construction must consider its neighboring context and carefully blend heights,
building form and articulation to ensure continuous streetwall rhythm in the VC
district (see figure 3.1 of this section).
   FIGURE 3.1
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2238.gif]
   D.   Building Placement: Buildings placed close to the sidewalk help "frame"
the streetscape, creating an active, intimate pedestrian environment. This type
of mixed use storefront building placement is one of the key characteristics of
downtown Antioch with the majority of buildings in the core of Main Street and
Lake Street forming a definitive, continuous "streetwall".
The outer perimeter of buildings must be placed within the "build-to zone" as
shown in figures 3.2 and 3.3 of this section, except as otherwise noted in this
chapter.
   FIGURE 3.2

IMAGES/0-0-0-2910.gif]
 
      1.   Building Setback:
         a.   Building setback to "build-to zone": Zero feet (0') minimum/three
feet (3') maximum build-to zone is measured from fifteen foot (15') minimum
setback from face of curb to face of building (buildings may be set back more
than 3 feet if additional setback is used to ensure minimum 15 foot sidewalk
and parkway width). (A)
         b.   Building setback abutting other adjacent (side/rear) property
lines: Zero feet (0') minimum/ten feet (10') maximum. A ten foot (10')
pedestrian pass-through is allowed if necessary to access a rear parking lot or
part of a continuous pedestrian linkage system in the greater downtown. (B)
         c.   Side yard, adjacent to an access drive: Ten feet (10') minimum.
(C)
         d.   Corner side yard on a side street: Zero feet (0') minimum/three
feet (3') maximum (buildings may be set back more than 3 feet if additional
setback is used to ensure minimum 15 foot sidewalk and parkway width). (D)
         e.   Rear yard, adjacent to an alley: Five feet (5') minimum. (E)
         f.   Rear yard, not adjacent to an alley: Twenty feet (20') minimum.
(F)
      2.   Main Street View Corridor: In order to create a defined and
protected view corridor to two (2) of the village's significant historic
building assets, new buildings located on both sides of Main Street between
Orchard and Depot must be set back further (see figure 3.4 of this section) to
ensure an open view to the Lakes Regional Museum and United Methodist Church Of
Antioch from the Main and Orchard intersection.
   FIGURE 3.4
View corridor of Lakes Regional Museum and United Methodist Church Of Antioch
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2912.gif]
 
      3.   General - New Development: In order to enhance pedestrian safety and
movement, all new development must allow for a total combined sidewalk and
parkway width not less than fifteen feet (15') as measured from the curb face
and not more than eighteen feet (18') in width.
   E.   Building Frontage: Building frontage standards address the ground floor
profile of buildings. These standards work with building placement guidelines
to ensure an appropriate relationship between buildings and the sidewalk, which
helps preserve the unique character of the village core district.
      1.   A minimum of seventy five percent (75%) of the street facing
building facade between two feet (2') and eight feet (8') in height, above the
sidewalk, must consist of nonreflective windows that allow views of indoor
retail/merchandising areas. The bottom of any window used to satisfy this
requirement may not be more than 4.5 feet above the adjacent sidewalk.
Consistency in this bottom area, or knee wall zone, should be considered
between adjacent buildings (see figure 3.5 of this section).
   FIGURE 3.5
Articulated commercial building facade
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2914.gif]
 
      2.   Window fenestration shall strive to achieve interest and variety and
avoid monotony.
      3.   Buildings must have a recognizable and defined public entrance
facing the main street (sidewalk) frontage. If a lot abuts two (2) public
streets, the required pedestrian entrance must face the street (sidewalk) with
the highest pedestrian volumes. Lots that front on more than two (2) streets
must have at least one public entrance on at least two (2) street frontages.
      4.   The depth and width of recessed building frontages may not exceed
six feet (6') (see figure 3.6 of this section).
   FIGURE 3.6
Recessed building entry
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2916.gif]
 
      5.   For new development, the building's ground floor elevation must
provide an accessible and barrier free entry and should be no more than zero
and one foot (1') above existing adjacent building sidewalk grade. For
rehabilitation of existing buildings, where practical the entrance shall be
barrier free.
      6.   The facade of all buildings exceeding seventy five feet (75') in
width must be vertically divided into bays or other segments no more than
thirty feet (30') in width. New buildings must have articulation and variety in
the facade to ensure Main Street character is developed over time.
   FIGURE 3.7
Example one-story storefront

   F.   Parking Placement: Off street parking not contained within the building
is required to be placed in the rear of the building or underground to reduce
the visibility and impact on safety of the pedestrian environment. As shown in
figure 3.9 of this section, surface parking must be placed as follows:
   FIGURE 3.9
Typical parking placement in VC district
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/

      1.   Placed in the rear fifty percent (50%) of the lot depth (from the
front building line to the rear property line). (A)
      2.   Five feet (5') from the side yard (adjacent commercial parking lots
must be connected) at grade level. (B)
      3.   Ten feet (10') minimum from the rear of the lot if not adjacent to
an alley. (C)
      4.   Five feet (5') minimum from the rear of the lot if adjacent to an
alley. (D)
      5.   Five feet (5') from the building line on the side yard of a corner
lot. (E)
Note: Existing buildings undergoing rehabilitation shall relocate all parking
behind the principal building setback, where practical.
Figure 3.10 of this section further illustrates parking location requirements
and building massing standards that apply to the entire downtown area.
   FIGURE 3.10

See section
10-10-10, "Urban Design Standards", of this chapter for parking lot screening
and landscaping requirements.
Note: Exceptions for off street parking placement can be made where unique
site, grade or environmental conditions warrant preservation of a specific site
feature. Additionally, a height bonus of one additional floor is given to new
development that provides structured parking in the principal structure.
   G.   Off Street Parking And Loading Access: Mid block curb cuts and access
drives, unless already existing, are not allowed in the village core district.
Loading, if required or provided, and parking access must be from an alley,
side street or at the rear of the building. (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011)
10-10-6: TRANSITIONAL CORE DISTRICT - TC:
   A.   Description: The transitional core district - TC is intended to extend
Antioch's downtown building and urban form character in adjacent downtown
redevelopment parcels and train station areas. This district strives to create
a physical connection to the train station and potential transit oriented
development. The TC district consists primarily of the superblock bounded by
Orchard Street, Toft Avenue, Lake Street and Hillside Avenue, as well as the
immediate area around the train station. Currently, these sites or areas
predominantly contain a mix of auto oriented uses including large areas of
surface parking and strip center style buildings set back from the primary
street frontages. This district is intended to establish the setting for future
redevelopment by creating physical relationships that harmonize with Antioch's
downtown character in terms of development, height, scale and function.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2926.gif]
 
The TC district, shown in brown, consists primarily of the superblock west of
Main Street (above), as well as the area around the train station (below).
   B.   Use:
      1.   Ground Floor: Only retail sales, service uses, entertainment uses
(e.g., eating and drinking establishments), residential uses (as part of an
overall multi-family residential building or development parcel) and commercial
office uses may be located on the ground floor of buildings in the TC district.
      2.   Above The Ground Floor: Retail, commercial, office, personal service
or residential is allowed above the ground floor.
   C.   Height: Building height limits are established to ensure reasonable,
predictable limits on maximum building height and to match the pedestrian
shopping mixed use street character of adjacent existing buildings in the
village core. The maximum allowed building height in the transitional core
district is forty five feet (45').
   D.   Building Placement: New buildings placed close to the sidewalk help
"frame" the street, creating an active pedestrian environment. This type of
building placement helps support and enhance the character of the adjacent
village core district, creates a continuous "streetwall" and reinforces the
already successful pedestrian environment.
The outer perimeter of buildings must be placed within the "build-to zone" as
shown in figures 3.11 and 3.12 of this section, except as otherwise noted in
this section.
   FIGURE 3.11

      1.   Building Setback:
         a.   Building setback to "build-to zone":
            (1)   Commercial/office/mixed use (figure 3.11 of this section):
Zero feet (0') minimum/three feet (3') maximum. Build-to zone is measured from
fifteen foot (15') minimum setback from face of curb to face of building
(buildings may be set back more than 3 feet if additional setback is used to
ensure minimum 15 foot sidewalk and parkway width). (A)
            (2)   Residential (figure 3.12 of this section): Ten feet (10')
minimum/twenty feet (20') maximum setback measured from right of way. (A)
         b.   Building setback abutting other property lines: Zero feet (0')
minimum/ten feet (10') maximum. A ten foot (10') pedestrian pass- through is
allowed if necessary to access a rear parking lot or provide a continuous
planned pedestrian linkage consistent with downtown planning. (B)
         c.   Side yard, adjacent to an access drive: Ten feet (10') minimum.
(C)
         d.   Side yard, corner lot on side street:
            (1)   Commercial/office/mixed use (figure 3.11 of this section):
Zero feet (0') minimum/three feet (3') maximum (buildings may be set back more
than 3 feet if additional setback is used to ensure minimum 15 foot sidewalk
and parkway width). (D)
            (2)   Residential (figure 3.12 of this section): Ten feet (10')
minimum/twenty feet (20') maximum. (D)
         e.   Rear yard, adjacent to alley: Five feet (5') minimum. (E)
         f.   Rear yard, not adjacent to an alley: Twenty feet (20') minimum.
(F)
         g.   Garage to alley: Four feet (4') minimum (apron only).
      2.   Sidewalks And Parkways:
         a.   Commercial/Mixed Use: In order to enhance pedestrian safety and
movement, all new commercial or mixed use development must allow for a minimum
of fifteen foot (15') wide sidewalk and parkway, which is the typical sidewalk
width in this district. Generally, the width of sidewalks and parkways must be
consistent with adjoining properties. The total combined sidewalk and parkway
width must not be less than fifteen feet (15') and not more than eighteen feet
(18') in width.
         b.   For Residential Uses: For areas with adjacent ground floor
residential uses, a minimum sidewalk width of five feet (5') should be
provided. Landscaped or tree parkways must be a minimum of six feet (6') and no
larger than ten feet (10') (see figure 3.13 of this section).

   E.   Building Frontage: Building frontage standards address the ground floor
profile of both commercial/mixed use buildings and residential buildings. These
standards work with building placement guidelines to ensure an appropriate
relationship between buildings and the sidewalk, which helps preserve the
character of the transitional core.
      1.   A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the street facing building
facade between three feet (3') and eight feet (8') in height, above the
sidewalk, must consist of nonreflective windows that allow views of indoor
areas. The bottom of any window used to satisfy this requirement may not be
more than 4.5 feet above the finished floor of the first floor of the building.
      2.   With the exception of mid or big box stores, such as a grocery
store, which may have the primary entrance from a parking lot in the rear or
side, buildings must have a public entrance facing the primary street
(sidewalk). If a lot abuts two (2) streets, the required pedestrian entrance
must face the street (sidewalk) with the highest pedestrian volumes. Lots that
front on more than two (2) streets should have at least one public entrance on
at least two (2) street frontages.
      3.   Key corner buildings on the west side of Toft at the intersections
of Toft with Orchard and Lake are required to have unique corner architectural
feature(s) (see figures 3.16 and 3.17 of this section).
   FIGURE 3.16
New buildings at the Orchard/Toft and Lake/Toft intersections are required to
have architectural features.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2941.gif]
 
      4.   The depth and width of recessed or articulated building frontages
may not exceed six feet (6').
      5.   Retail, commercial and lobby entrances to multi-tenant residential
building's ground floor elevation must be accessible and barrier free and be
between zero and one foot (1') above the existing public sidewalk grade.
Attached single-family unit entrances may have finished floor elevations up to
six feet (6') above the sidewalk.
      6.   The facade of all buildings exceeding seventy five feet (75') in
width (including attached multi-family residential) must be vertically divided
and articulated into bays or other segments no more than thirty feet (30') in
width. Facade planes must be offset a minimum of three feet (3').
      7.   Attached single-family/multi-family residential units shall have
front doors facing primary streets.
   F.   Parking Placement: Off street parking not contained within the building
is encouraged to be placed in the rear of the building or underground to reduce
the visibility and impact on safety of the pedestrian environment. In the case
of a larger development such as a grocery store or big box store, which would
require a larger number of parking spaces, parking must be placed as follows:
      1.   Larger Development:
         a.   Parking lot frontages along main streets must not be greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the lot's frontage.
         b.   Parking lots must not be located at corners of main street
intersections.
         c.   Parking lots should be shared between uses with connected
driveways at grade (see figure 3.18 of this section).
   FIGURE 3.18
Shared parking between uses.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2943.gif]
 
         d.   Parking lots should be broken down into cells or smaller pods of
one hundred (100) spaces or less divided by areas of open space, landscape or
pedestrian amenities and facilities.
         e.   Parking lot perimeters should be adequately buffered through
landscape plantings that soften the visual impact of the vehicular use area
(see figure 3.19 of this section).
   FIGURE 3.19
Parking lot screening

IMAGES/0-0-0-2945.gif]
 
         f.   All parking lot areas shall be well lit to maintain a safe
environment per existing village codes and regulations.
As noted in the planning process, METRA forecasts the need for additional
parking within the TC district. The parcels south of Depot Street, which are
planned to be future parking, as well as the current METRA lot are exempt from
other TC parking restrictions, but must meet landscaping and screening
standards addressed in section
10-10-10, "Urban Design Standards", of this chapter. In addition, METRA parking
lots must meet the standards set forth by METRA's parking manual, where
compatible.
      2.   Other Surface Parking: As shown in figure 3.20 of this section, all
other surface parking in the TC district must be placed as follows:
   FIGURE 3.20
Typical parking placement in TC district.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2947.gif]
 
         a.   Placed in the rear fifty percent (50%) of the lot depth (from the
front building line to the rear property line). (A)
         b.   Five feet (5') from the side yard (adjacent commercial parking
lots must be connected at grade). (B)
         c.   Ten feet (10') minimum from the rear of the lot if not adjacent
to an alley. (C)
         d.   Five feet (5') minimum from the rear of the lot if adjacent to an
alley. (D)
         e.   Five feet (5') from the building line on corner side yards. (E)
   G.   METRA Parking: Most grant dollars, including METRA's, are not available
for financing the replacement of commuter parking spaces that are displaced
from designated and/or historical commuter parking facilities. METRA only
participates in building new parking spaces where demand warrants and funding
is available.
The land for the existing commuter parking was purchased with state and federal
funds, thus redevelopment will need to be discussed with IDOT. As such, the use
of federal funds for the construction of new parking facilities may be
restricted, if parking spaces that were federally funded, are removed or
altered during redevelopment.
Should development occur near the train station, throughout each step of the
redevelopment process the amount of commuter parking in the station area should
remain at its current level, resulting in no net loss of spaces during any
phase of development. Note: Any property transactions with METRA may require
approval by METRA's board of directors.
   H.   Off Street Parking And Loading Access: Parking lots and loading should
be accessed from interior access drives, alleys or limited/shared curb cuts
from main (primary) streets. Mid block curb cuts and access drives, unless
already existing, are discouraged in the transitional core district. One
exception is the large superblock bounded by Orchard Avenue, Toft Avenue, Lake
Street and Hillside Avenue. Any new curb cuts must be evaluated and determined
safe by licensed traffic engineers and village engineering staff.
As shown in figure 3.21 of this section, an internal schematic grid street
network has been envisioned for the superblock site bounded by Orchard Avenue,
Toft Avenue, Lake Street and Hillside Avenue. Three (3) north/south streets or
access drives, including Spafford Street extended, may divide the block between
Hillside and Toft Avenues and one east/west street or access drive should
bisect the block between Orchard Avenue and Lake Street. These streets/access
drives will increase vehicular and pedestrian "permeability", distribute
automobile traffic more evenly and increase access to new development and
parking.
These internal drives or access routes are diagrammatic and refer to the
village's ultimate desire to have this block organized and interconnected in a
vehicular/pedestrian network. As this site is developed over time, the village
will require individual projects to maintain the desired north/south, east/west
connections through a formal set of site access easements, which generally may
take the shape as depicted in figure 3.21 of this section.
   FIGURE 3.21
Schematic internal access structure - superblock site.

10-10-7: MAIN STREET TRANSITIONAL DISTRICT - MT:
   A.   Description: The Main Street transitional district - MT is intended to
accommodate a variety of single-family and multi- family residential,
commercial and institutional uses on the edges of the village core. These areas
currently consist of a variety of single-family and multi-family residential,
limited commercial uses, educational and civic facilities, such as Antioch High
School and Public Library, as well as many single- family homes that have been
converted for commercial use.
   B.   Use:
      1.   Ground Floor: Only residential (single-family and multi- family),
retail sales, service uses, educational, entertainment uses (e.g., eating and
drinking establishments), and commercial office uses may be located on the
ground floor of buildings in the MT district.
      2.   Above The Ground Floor: Any combination of allowed educational,
civic/institutional, retail, commercial, personal service or residential is
allowed above the ground floor.
   C.   Height: Building height limits are established to ensure reasonable,
predictable limits on maximum building height and preserve the low rise main
street character of the designated Main Street transitional district. The
maximum allowed building height in the MT district is thirty five feet (35').
   D.   Building Placement: Buildings should be placed in a similar
relationship to the road as adjacent buildings to help create a consistent
streetscape setback character throughout the neighborhoods. Where possible
building siting should also focus on reducing views of building sides, rear
yards and other spaces.
The outer perimeter of buildings must be placed within the "build-to zone" as
shown in figures 3.23 and 3.24 of this section, except as otherwise noted in
this chapter.
   FIGURE 3.23
MT district building placement.

      1.   Building Setback:
         a.   Building setback abutting apparent street right of way: Thirty
feet (30') minimum/forty five feet (45') maximum. (A)
         b.   Building setback abutting interior side property lines: Five feet
(5') minimum. (B)
         c.   Rear yard: Twenty feet (20'). (C)
         d.   Side yard, corner lot on side street: Thirty feet (30') minimum/
forty five feet (45') maximum from the building line on corner side yards. (D)
   E.   Building Frontage: Building frontage standards address the ground floor
profile of buildings. These standards work with building placement guidelines
to ensure an appropriate relationship between buildings and the sidewalk, which
helps preserve the character of the Main Street transitional.
      1.   All buildings must be oriented to primary or secondary street with
street facing windows and doors.
      2.   In order to provide articulation to buildings, facades should
consider porticoes, stoops, porches, arcades or other forms of defining
entries.
   F.   Parking Placement: All off street parking shall be placed in garages or
in the rear portion of the lot. For other uses requiring larger parking lots,
such as institutional or commercial, off street parking not contained within
the building shall be placed in the rear of the building or underground to
reduce the visibility and impact on safety of the pedestrian environment. As
shown in figure 3.25 of this section, surface and garage parking for these uses
must be placed as follows:
   FIGURE 3.25
MT district parking placement.

      1.   Placed in the rear fifty percent (50%) of the lot depth (from the
front building line to the rear property line). (A)
      2.   Five feet (5') from the side yard. (B)
      3.   Ten feet (10') minimum from the rear of the lot. (C)
      4.   Twenty five feet (25') from the building line on the corner side
yard. (D)
Note: Existing buildings undergoing rehabilitation shall relocate all parking
behind the principal building setback, where practical.
   G.   Access: Mid block curb cuts and access drives are permitted in the MT
district to access single-family and multi-family residences, as long as they
do not adversely affect safe traffic flow or ingress/egress movements. Where
feasible, locate driveways off side streets/access drives to avoid an
overabundance of curb cuts on primary streets.
Shared driveways/access points are encouraged for multi- family residential
buildings and institutional/educational uses.

(D)
      5.   Rear yard, adjacent to a street: Twenty five feet (25') minimum/
thirty feet (30') if adjacent to residential district. (E)
   E.   Building Frontage: Building frontage standards address the ground floor
profile of buildings. These standards work with building placement guidelines
to ensure an appropriate relationship between buildings and the sidewalk, which
would help improve the character of the business park.
      1.   Any office uses and main entries for visitors must be oriented to
the primary or secondary street with street facing windows and doors.
      2.   Blank unarticulated walls exceeding thirty feet (30') in length are
not allowed facing any roadways.
   F.   Parking Placement: Off street parking not contained within the building
is encouraged to be placed in the rear of the building or underground to reduce
the visibility and impact on safety of the pedestrian environment. As shown in
figure 3.30 of this section, surface parking must be placed as follows:
   FIGURE 3.30

   G.   Off Street Parking And Loading Access: Mid block curb cuts and access
drives are permitted, but adjacent uses are strongly encouraged to share access
drives wherever possible. For new development, loading is required to be placed
in the rear of the building or on the interior of a block and accessed from an
alley, interior drive or side street/access drive. (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011)
10-10-9: COMMERCIAL EDGE DISTRICT - CE:
   A.   Description: The commercial edge district - CE is intended to create an
improved transitional "gateway" district at the primary southern entry point to
downtown Antioch at the intersection of State Highway 173 and IL-83/Main
Street. This area currently consists of predominantly auto oriented commercial
uses, such as fast food restaurants and convenience retail. The CE district
strives to enhance the character of the area by improving site and design
standards for development of new buildings, streets, streetscapes and landscape
character, as well as providing the opportunity to create an extended mixed use
district matching that of the village core.
The CE district, shown in blue, is located on the far southern edge of the
downtown study area.

   B.   Use:
      1.   Ground Floor: Any combination of allowed commercial, retail, and
office uses may be located on the ground floor of buildings in the CE.
      2.   Above The Ground Floor: Any combination of allowed commercial,
retail and office uses are allowed above the ground floor.
   C.   Height: Building height limits are established to ensure reasonable,
predictable limits on maximum building height. The maximum allowed building
height in the CE district is forty five feet (45').
   D.   Building Placement: Buildings may be placed in a similar relationship
to the road as adjacent buildings, but also shall be encouraged to be placed
closer to the right of way line to reduce the amount of parking along primary
street frontages. Where possible, building siting should also focus on reducing
views of building sides, drive-throughs, loading zones, parking areas and
service areas.
The outer perimeter of buildings must be placed within the "build-to zone" as
shown in figure 3.31 of this section, except as otherwise noted in this
chapter.
   FIGURE 3.31

      3.   Side yard, adjacent to an access drive: Ten feet (10') minimum.
      4.   Rear yard: Twenty feet (20') minimum. (C)
   E.   Building Frontage: Building frontage standards address the ground floor
profile of buildings. These standards work with building placement guidelines
to ensure an appropriate relationship between buildings and the sidewalk, which
would help improve the character of the commercial edge.
      1.   A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the street facing building
facade between two feet (2') and eight feet (8') in height, above the sidewalk,
must consist of nonreflective windows that allow views of indoor retail/
merchandising areas. The bottom of any window used to satisfy this requirement
may not be more than 4.5 feet above the adjacent sidewalk. Consistency in this
bottom area, or knee wall zone, should be considered between adjacent
buildings.
      2.   Buildings must have a recognizable and defined public entrance
facing the main street (sidewalk) frontage. If a lot abuts two (2) streets, the
required pedestrian entrance must face the street (sidewalk) with the highest
pedestrian volumes. Lots that front on more than two (2) streets must have at
least one public entrance on at least two (2) street frontages.
      3.   The depth and width of recessed building frontages may not exceed
six feet (6').
      4.   The building's ground floor elevation must provide an accessible and
barrier free entry and should be no more than zero and one foot (1') above
sidewalk grade.
      5.   The facade of all buildings exceeding fifty feet (50') in width must
be vertically divided and articulated into bays or other segments no more than
twenty five feet (25') in width.
   F.   Parking Placement: Off street parking not contained within the building
is encouraged to be placed in the rear of the building to reduce the visibility
and impact on safety of the pedestrian environment. As shown in figure 3.32 of
this section, surface parking must be placed as follows:

      2.   Five feet (5') from the side yard (adjacent commercial parking lots
must be connected) at grade level. (B)
      3.   Ten feet (10') minimum from the rear of the lot if not adjacent to
an alley. (C)
      4.   Five feet (5') minimum from the rear of the lot if adjacent to an
alley.
      5.   Five feet (5') from the building line on the side yard of a corner
lot. (D)
Note: Existing buildings undergoing rehabilitation shall relocate all parking
behind the principal building setback, where practical.
   G.   Off Street Parking And Loading Access: Mid block curb cuts and access
drives are permitted, but adjacent uses are strongly encouraged to share access
drives wherever possible. For new development, loading is required to be placed
in the rear of the building or on the interior of a block and accessed from an
alley, interior drive or side street/access drive. (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011)
10-10-10: URBAN DESIGN STANDARDS:
These general urban design standards are intended for use in all downtown
Antioch districts and should be applied as appropriate to any individual
district's character. Project specific requirements or land use will dictate
the appropriate standards to consider when developing, renovating or improving
a district property. (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011)
10-10-10-1: BUILDING DESIGN:
   A.   General:
      1.   Buildings shall be oriented toward public primary and secondary
streets, sidewalks and public plazas/open spaces to maintain an active and
inviting pedestrian environment.

10-10-12: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICY:
By creating a vibrant mixed use transit oriented downtown character,
incorporating transit supportive services, clustering buildings, establishing
interconnected, attractive streetscapes and creating a shared stormwater
management system, Antioch intends to foster sustainable development within the
downtown. This policy and planning objective decreases vehicle trips on area
roads, reduces energy consumption and air pollution and limits paved surfaces
dedicated to parking.
   A.   All new development within the downtown districts shall consider "best
management practices" in regards to sustainable building design, site planning,
streetscape/landscape design and infrastructure engineering.
   B.   Sustainable design and materials should be incorporated into any new
proposals. Green building design principles should consider the overall
downtown environment during design and construction. In general, sustainable
buildings are energy efficient, water conserving, durable and nontoxic, with
high quality spaces and high recycled content materials. The following
considerations should be included in any new site and building design and
construction activities within the downtown districts:
      1.   Consider adaptive reuse or preservation of high quality/character
buildings within the district. Preservation and adaptive reuse through
renovation is considered one of the most sustainable development solutions.
      2.   Optimize building orientation for maximum heat gain, shading,
daylighting and natural ventilation.
      3.   Design site landscape and hardscape character, as well as building
rooftop systems to create comfortable microclimates and reduce heat island
effects.
      4.   Select native, low maintenance landscape materials and consider the
reuse of stormwater runoff or "graywater" where feasible to reduce or eliminate
the need for potable water in landscape irrigation. (Leadership in energy and
environmental design or LEED)

IMAGES/0-0-0-3025.gif]
 
      5.   Incorporate design for easy pedestrian, bicycle and transit access.
      6.   Maximize alternative and traditional on site stormwater management
through natural solutions, such as landscaping and permeable pavement.
Bioswales and best practices in stormwater management shall be considered in
all new site develpment.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/

      7.   Maintain or reduce the peak stormwater discharge rate and quantity.
(LEED)
      8.   Use sustainable, rapidly renewable or recycled building materials.
(LEED)
      9.   Use building materials manufactured within the region to reduce
transportation and shipping energy. (LEED)
      10.   Design and select lighting and equipment for efficient energy use
and long term durability.
      11.   Increase water efficiency through the use of high efficiency
systems and fixtures or through graywater reuse to decrease use on the
village's water supply and wastewater system. (LEED)
      12.   Minimize off site light pollution. (LEED)
      13.   Create healthy, comfortable indoor environments through increased
natural lighting, control of thermal systems, reduced VOCs (volatile organic
compounds) and improved indoor air quality and ventilation. (LEED)
      14.   Create/enact natural plan solutions to control erosion,
sedimentation and dust during construction. (LEED)
      15.   Conduct commissioning of building energy systems to ensure desired
performance. (LEED)
      16.   Include on site renewable energy sources where feasible. (LEED)
      17.   Reduce or eliminate heating, ventilation, air conditioning and
refrigeration (HVAC & R) equipment that emits compounds that contribute to
ozone depletion and climate change. (LEED)
      18.   Provide for an easily accessible dedicated area for the collection
and storage of materials for recycling. (LEED)
      19.   Incorporate universal design into building floor plans and
streetscapes/open spaces, where feasible. (LEED-ND) (Ord. 11-10-15, 10-17-2011)
CHAPTER 11
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
10-11-1: General
10-11-2: Nonconforming Lots
10-11-3: Nonconforming Buildings
10-11-4: Other Nonconforming Situations
10-11-1: GENERAL:
   A.   Intent: This chapter governs nonconformities: those uses, lots,
buildings or other aspects of development that may have complied with previous
zoning regulations, but through zoning ordinance revisions or amendments no
longer conform to the current regulations. The intent of this chapter is to
clarify to what extent and under what circumstances such nonconformities can be
altered, expanded, or allowed to continue. Other intentions of this chapter are
to allow for the preservation and reuse of existing buildings; recognize the
interests of landowners whose property and its uses were lawfully established,
and place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have or potentially may
have adverse effects on surrounding properties or the community.
   B.   Authority To Continue A Nonconformity: Any nonconformity that existed
on January 1, 2020, or situation that becomes a nonconformity upon adoption of
any amendment to this title may be continued in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
   C.   Continued Status Of Nonconformity: Nonconforming status rests with the
property, not with the owner. Such status is not affected by changes in
ownership, tenancy, or management.
   D.   Repairs And Maintenance: Nonconforming buildings and lots carry the
same obligations and requirements for safe upkeep as conforming buildings and
lots. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance necessary to keep a
nonconformity in compliance with the village building code are permitted unless
otherwise expressly prohibited in this title. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-11-2: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   Nonconforming Lots In R Districts: The following provisions shall
apply:
      1.   A nonconforming lot in an R district may be developed with a single-
family house, providing setback requirements and bulk and density standards are
met.
      2.   Likewise, a nonconforming lot that is enlarged, yet remains
nonconforming may be developed with a single-family house, providing setback,
bulk and density restrictions are met.
      3.   If an existing single-family house in an R district is destroyed by
accident, it may be rebuilt, providing setback, bulk and density restrictions
are met.
      4.   Non-residential development of a non-conforming lot in an R district
may occur only if the zoning board of appeals grants a variance for any and all
the nonconformities that result from inadequate lot area or lot width (for
example, parking requirements cannot be met).
   B.   Nonconforming Lots In Other Districts: In non-residential zoning
districts, a nonconforming lot may be developed providing that:
      1.   The lot in question existed in its current dimensions at the time of
the effective date of this chapter; and
      2.   The use is permitted in the zoning district where the nonconforming
lot is located; and
      3.   The zoning board of appeals grants variances for any other
nonconformities that result from inadequate lot area or lot width (for example,
parking requirements cannot be met).
   C.   Change Of Nonconforming Use:
      1.   To A Permitted Use: A nonconforming use may be converted to a use
permitted in the subject zoning district.
      2.   To Another Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming use may not be changed
to another nonconforming use.
      3.   Expansion Of Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming use, whether inside
or outside of a building, may not be expanded beyond the area it occupies at
the time of the adoption of this title or any subsequent amendment.
      4.   Discontinuance Of Nonconforming Use: If a nonconforming use is
discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, it shall not be re-
established.
      5.   Relocation: No building in which a nonconforming use is conducted
may be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other
lot unless the use of that lot conforms to the regulations of the zoning
district in which the building is to be moved. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-11-3: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS:
   A.   Alterations Or Enlargements Of Nonconforming Buildings: A nonconforming
building may be altered or enlarged only if the alterations or enlargements do
not increase the extent of the nonconformity or add another nonconformity. For
example, a building that does not meet a setback requirement may add an
additional floor so long as the additional height and bulk comply with the
applicable regulations. Likewise, a building that does not meet a setback
requirement may be enlarged so long as the addition follows the same building
wall line and does not result in an additional encroachment into the setback
area.
   B.   Destruction Or Damage Of Nonconforming Buildings:
      1.   Destruction: If a nonconforming building is intentionally removed or

accidental destruction.
   C.   Relocation Of Nonconforming Building: No nonconforming building shall
be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless the building conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which
the building is to be located. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)

10-12-6: Schedule Of Off-Street Parking Guidelines
10-12-7: Off-Street Loading
10-12-8: Administrative Adjustment Of Parking Standards
10-12-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a balance between the necessary
parking for successful business operations and creating vibrant neighborhoods,
while also preserving the village's sense of place and character.
Implementation of these standards is intended to provide an appropriate amount
of parking that is necessary for commerce and creating safe neighborhoods.
(Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-12-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   All Zoning Districts: The provisions for parking outlined in this
section shall regulate parking in the village except for Downtown Antioch
(DPD), which will be regulated by section
10-12-5.
   B.   Existing Buildings: For existing buildings and existing land uses, the
following provisions shall apply:
      1.   At Time This Chapter Is Adopted: The minimum number of parking
spaces designated for specific land uses in this section shall not be applied
to existing structures or for structures that have an approved building permit
on the effective date of this chapter.
      2.   Subsequent Expansions: If such land, structures or uses are
enlarged, expanded or changed, there shall be provided and maintained, for the
increment of expansion only, at least the amount of off-street parking space
that would be required if the increment were a separate structure or use
established or placed into operation after the effective date of this chapter.
      3.   Change In Land Use: Where land uses change in an existing building,
the parking standards for the new land use shall apply.
   C.   New Buildings: All buildings constructed after the effective date of
this chapter shall provide for parking that conforms to the standards of this
chapter.
      1.   Measurements: When units of measurement result in the requirement of
a fractional space, any fraction shall require one (1) parking space. Example:
a particular property has two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of
gross floor area and the land use requires one (1) parking space per three
hundred (300) square feet; 2,500/300 = 8.3; therefore nine (9) parking spaces
are required.
      2.   Multi-Use Buildings And Parcels Of Land: If a building or parcel of
land contains more than one (1) land use, the off-street parking and loading
requirements shall be based on the sum of the off-street parking and loading
requirements of all the individual land uses.
   D.   Location Of Off-Street Parking: The placement and location of off-
street parking stalls and parking lots shall conform to the standards as
outlined in this chapter.
   E.   Restrictions:
      1.   Vehicle Repair: Parking areas shall not be used for the repair,
dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies.
Garages for residential properties are exempt from this restriction.
      2.   Inoperable Vehicles: Inoperable vehicles shall not be parked in
parking lots, driveways, or any unimproved area.
      3.   Prohibited Parking: Parking or storage of any vehicles or part
thereof including, but not limited to: trailers, campers, boats, and recreation
vehicles, on lawn areas, in front or side yards, on areas set aside for
landscaping, or on any other area not surfaced for off street parking as
provided in this section is prohibited.
         a.   Recreational vehicles and equipment may be parked on private
property in a garage, in rear yards and side yards, provided the recreational
vehicle shall be placed on a permitted driveway surface (concrete, asphalt or
approved brick pavers) and located in compliance with the regulations of this
chapter.
         b.   Overnight parking of a recreational vehicle or equipment on a
public street or within a right of way is prohibited.
         c.   No recreational vehicle shall be parked within ten (10) feet of
any adjacent dwelling on an adjoining lot, nor shall it be parked within one
(1) foot of a lot line and drainage of the lot must be maintained at all times.
         d.   No recreational vehicle or equipment shall be parked in front
yards or within ten (10) feet of a side yard that is adjacent to a street.

(Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-12-3: SHARED PARKING:
   A.   Description: Shared parking is encouraged and takes place in which two
(2) or more owners of non-residential properties with different peak-hour
parking demands use the same off-street parking spaces in order to comply with
the villages off-street parking requirements.
   B.   The director of community development is authorized to make an
administrative adjustment allowing shared parking arrangements for non-
residential uses with different hours of operation based on the following
factors:
      1.   The property owner has the burden to demonstrate that there is no
substantial conflict or overlap in the principal operating hours for which the
shared parking is proposed; and
      2.   The shared parking must be within three hundred feet (300') feet
walking distance of each of the uses, as measured from the entrance of each use
to the nearest parking space in the facility.
      3.   The property owner must show that there are safe pedestrian
connections between the proposed shared parking spaces and the front or rear
door of the subject property.
   C.   Agreement: The parties involved shall execute an agreement on the
shared parking and file it with the director of community development. The
shared parking shall remain in effect only so long as the agreement remains in
force. If the agreement is no longer in force, then the property owners must
provide parking as otherwise required by this title. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-12-4: COLLECTIVE PARKING AND REDUCTION IN PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Description: Collective parking is an arrangement whereby two (2) or
more commercial properties use the same parking lot to fulfill their off-street
parking requirements.
   B.   Approval: For such an arrangement, the director of community
development is authorized to make an administrative adjustment that reduces the
off-street parking requirements for each participating commercial property by
twenty percent (20%). In order to approve such an administrative adjustment,
the director of community development must find that:
      1.   The collective parking facility is located within six hundred feet
(600') walking distance of each of the uses, as measured from the entrance of
each use to the nearest parking space in the facility.
      2.   There are convenient, visible pedestrian connections between the
facility and all of the sharing properties.
   C.   Agreement: The parties involved shall execute an agreement on the
collective parking and file it with the director of community development. The
collective parking shall remain in effect only so long as the agreement remains
in force. If the agreement is no longer in force, then the property owners must
provide parking as otherwise required by this title. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-12-5: DOWNTOWN PARKING DISTRICT:
   A.   Purpose: The Downtown Parking District approximates an area that
historically has been the village's downtown and includes the area around
village hall. Generally, the Downtown Parking District (DPD) is occupied with
older commercial and residential buildings on small lots. The DPD allows for an
area-wide approach to solving the parking demands of the downtown area.
Lowering the conventional parking requirements for the DPD is intended to
encourage the preservation of older buildings, create a pedestrian-friendly
environment, and ensure robust economic activity for commercial establishments
in the area.
   B.   Standards:
      1.   Exemption From Parking Requirements: Small residential and business
land uses within the DPD are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of
this title. Large commercial or office development with a gross floor area of
ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more will have to provide the village with
a parking plan, and it will be subject to village board review and approval.
      2.   Inclusion Of On-Street Parking: If parking is required of a
particular use in the DPD, all on-street parking spaces within six hundred feet
(600') of proposed use and any parking spaces within municipal parking lots
within six hundred feet (600') may be included in the calculation for the
required number of off-street parking spaces. Such distances shall be measured
from the customer entrance to the commercial use to the parking spaces.
      3.   Maximum Off-Street Parking Limits: Commercial establishments within
the DPD shall not provide several off-street parking spaces that is greater
than one hundred percent (100%) of the parking requirement for that
establishment's land use found in the table in section
10-12-6 .
      4.   Other Parking Arrangements: Shared parking and collective parking
arrangements are permissible and encouraged.
   5.   Administrative Adjustment: The director of community development may
grant administrative adjustment of parking requirements for noncommercial and
non-residential land uses within the DPD. In order to approve such an
administrative adjustment, the director of community development must find
that:
      a.   Based on evidence provided by the property owner, parking demand for
the property can be met with available on- and off-street parking in the
immediate vicinity; and
      b.   An administrative adjustment of the parking requirements will have
minimal adverse effects on other nearby land uses and surrounding
neighborhoods; and
      c.   Strict adherence to the parking requirements of section
10-12-6  would cause undue hardship for the property owner. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-
13-2020)

10-14-1: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
   A.   This chapter is intended to create the legal framework for a
comprehensive and balanced system to regulate signage that will preserve free
speech and promotion of commerce. Furthermore, this chapter is intended to
minimize any visual clutter that is harmful to the Village's appearance and to
promote safety by limiting signage that could potentially have a negative
impact on traffic and pedestrian safety. With these purposes in mind, it is the
intent of this chapter to authorize the use of signage to:
      1.   Promote the free flow of traffic along the Village's arterials and
collectors and to protect pedestrians and motorists from injury and property
damage which may be fully or partially attributable to cluttered, distracting,
or illegible signage.
      2.   Promote the use of signage that is aesthetically pleasing and of
appropriate scale that sensitively integrates into the surrounding context and
landscape. This chapter recognizes the difference in context between a
commercial arterial and the Village's downtown.
      3.   Provide for functional flexibility, encourage variety and to create
an incentive to relate signage to basic principles of good design.
      4.   Assure that public benefits derive from expenditures of public funds
for the improvement and beautification of streets and other public structures
and spaces are protected by exercising reasonable controls over the character
and design of graphic structures.
      5.   Provide for an improved visual environment and to protect prominent
corridors within the community by authorizing the use of street signage that
is:
         a.   Compatible with surroundings;
         b.   Appropriate to the activity that displays them;
         c.   Expressive of the identity of the individual activities and the
community as a whole; and
         d.   Legible in the circumstances in which they are seen. (Ord. 17-06-
20, 6-12-2017)
10-14-2: GENERAL REGULATIONS:
   A.   Sign Area Calculations:
      1.   Ground Signs: Ground signs shall be calculated by determining the
net rectangular area enclosing the sign including the outer edges of the
lettering, characters or delineations. Architectural treatments surrounding the
signage will not be included as the sign area, provided it does not exceed one
hundred percent (100%) of the total sign face. For double-sided signs, only one
face shall be considered in determining the sign area.
      2.   Wall, Window, Awning And Canopy Signs: The sign face area shall be
calculated by determining the area of the sign face including the frame, if
any. The sign face area of wall, window, awning or canopy signs consisting of
individually-mounted letters shall be deemed to be the area of the smallest
rectangular figure which can encompass all letters and graphics.
   B.   Setbacks:
      1.   All signs shall be set back not less than ten feet (10') or five
feet (5') within Downtown Sign District.
      2.   All such signs located on a corner lot shall not be located within
the vision triangle as defined in this chapter.
      3.   Ground signs on adjoining lots must have a minimum separation
distance of thirty feet (30'). Lots that develop before their bordering lots
shall locate their ground sign(s) in such a way as to provide an opportunity
for adjacent lots to erect a ground sign that meets this requirement.
   C.   Vision Triangle: No building or structure shall be erected or
maintained, nor any landscaping exceeding thirty six inches (36") in height
shall be grown or maintained within a triangular area determined by a diagonal
line connecting two (2) points measured along the property lines of the
abutting streets twenty five feet (25') equidistant from the intersection of
those property lines, so as to obstruct or obscure the vision of drivers of
motor vehicles on either or both streets. This provision shall apply on all
collectors and arterials within the Village. However, an exemption to this
provision shall be allowed in downtown as defined by the Antioch Downtown
Signage District when a building location would promote context sensitive
design.
   D.   Traffic Safety: No sign shall be maintained at any location where by
reason of its position, size, shape or color it may obstruct, impair, obscure,
interfere with the view of or be confused with any traffic control sign, signal
or device, or where it may interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic. The
decision on the determination of a traffic hazard shall rest with the Community
Development Director with consultation with the Village's Emergency Services.

All development plantings shall be maintained consistent with the terms of the
planned unit development.
   F.   Dormant Special Service Area: A dormant special service area (DSSA)
shall be required to be established concurrent with approval of a residential
planned unit development to ensure adequate property maintenance. This special
service area shall be created at the time of final platting of the first phase
of the planned unit development and shall include all phases of the planned
unit development. In the event the entity that has ownership and maintenance
responsibilities fails to adequately manage the open space, the village may
assume maintenance responsibilities until such time as that or another
appropriate entity can manage the open space. The village may tax the property
of those within the special service area for the village's prior and estimated
future cost of maintaining the open space. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-15-4: GUIDELINES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   In accordance with the provisions of this title, the village may
publish design guidelines for planned unit developments. In reviewing the
preliminary and final development plans the plan commission and village board
should ensure that any planned unit development is consistent with the
village's single-family design standards:
   B.   General: All planned unit developments shall be developed in strict
compliance with the recorded final plan, final landscape plan, and residential
pattern book (architectural design standards for the product being proposed
within the development) shall be approved by the village board as part of any
special use for a planned unit development. All final plans and covenants filed
and recorded by the village shall be contractual undertakings by, and shall be
binding upon, the applicants, therefore the owners of the land covered by such
planned development, their successors and assigns. The final plat and final
plan and final landscape plan, any pattern book along with supporting data
shall control and limit the use of the parcel of land (including the general
internal use of buildings and structures) and the location of the buildings and
structures in the planned development.
   C.   Occupancy: No planned unit development or any portion of a planned unit
development, may be occupied until such time as all applicable building
certificates have been issued by the appropriate village authority certifying
that the development, or a stage of the development, if applicable, has been
completed in compliance with the final plan and any recorded covenant or
developer agreement as approved and recorded.
   D.   Amendments And Administrative Adjustments To The Approved Final
Development Plan.
      1.   Major Changes: A major change requires a public hearing before the
plan commission and approval by the village board. The procedure for the
hearing and approval shall be in accordance with the provisions of this title.
Submittal requirements maybe limited to plans and documents that indicate or
are related to the major changes. Any of the following changes shall be deemed
a major change:
         a.   Any proposed change that would alter the character;
         b.   Increasing or decreasing the number of units or density of a
planned unit development would constitute a major change;
         c.   Any increase in the height of any building or structure beyond
five percent (5%), or alters the uses and design standards set forth as a
minimum in this title;
         d.   Any increase that would constitute a ten percent (10%) increase
in the gross floor area would constitute a major change;
         e.   A change which significantly reduces the amount of common open
space or recreational amenities;
         f.   A change that significantly alters the number, type, or location
of landscaping or existing vegetation; and/or
         g.   A change that would have a significant environmental impact.
      2.   Minor Changes: Minor changes are changes not defined as major
changes which do not alter the concept or intent of the planned unit
development. The community development director may approve minor changes in a
planned unit development. However, prior to considering any minor change the
community development director may request that the plan commission review the
proposed minor change and offer its recommendations.
   E.   Revocation: The planned unit development and the ordinances authorizing
it shall be subject to revocation. If the planned unit development is revoked
the zoning classification of the subject property will revert to the zoning
classification affixed to the property before approval of the PUD.
   1.   Grounds For Revocation: The planned unit development shall be subject
to revocation if:
         a.   The application for approval of the final development plan is not
filed within two (2) years from the date of approval of the preliminary
development plan; or
         b.   Construction does not commence within two (2) years from the date
of approval of the final development plan. For a planned unit development with
a phasing plan, the PUD shall be subject to revocation if the initial phase of
construction has not commenced within two (2) years of the approval of the PUD,
or if construction of any of the subsequent phases has not commenced or is not
completed in accordance with the terms of the phasing plan; or the developer
requests revocation of the PUD.
   2.   Extensions And Hearings: The village board may extend these time limits
in one (1) year increments. The village board may schedule a revocation. (Ord.
19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-15-5: APPROVAL PROCEDURES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
A PUD shall be granted as a special use to the zoning district in which it is
located. The village board is the final decision-making body. The process for
obtaining a PUD approval shall be as follows.

10-16-1: INTRODUCTION:
10-16-1-1: INTENT:
   A.   The following single-family design standards are intended to ensure
that the village's sense of place and character is maintained in the future. As
the village continues to grow, there continues to be a threat that the special
features that have defined the village's sense of place for generations will be
lost. In order to maintain the village's character and property values, staff
has created the following set of single-family design standards which will be
required of all residential builders in the future.
   B.   The village of Antioch will continue to be predominantly a community of
single-family homes. Based on this fact, it is critical that future single-
family developments conform with the development patterns that are reflected in
the village's most distinct neighborhoods. The following design standards will
require all builders to focus on incorporating certain design elements into
their standard home designs. As outlined throughout this chapter, these design
elements are relatively simple and generally a small portion of the total costs
of construction. They can, however, have a dramatic impact on the overall
quality of design.
   C.   Simple design elements as outlined below should be incorporated:

IMAGES/0-0-0-2458.jpg]
      1.   Front elevation wall plane should be broken up with a porch,
projections, bay window, recessed garage or some other architectural design
element.
      2.   Rooflines should be broken up with projections, recesses, dormers,
varying rooflines, deep eaves along the roofline.
      3.   Garages should be recessed and garage doors should incorporate
architectural detail and articulation. A percentage of the garages should
incorporate windows and single bays are encouraged. A maximum of one-third (1/
3) of any front elevation can be a garage.
      4.   Projecting usable porches with a minimum of eight feet (8') in depth
are encouraged on front elevations and wraparound porches are encouraged on
corner lots.
      5.   Balanced window placement along with good window fenestration is a
design element that is required on all four (4) elevations.
      6.   The proper use of materials on an elevation is important. The use of
too many materials or "wallpaper" application of materials should be avoided.
(Ord. 16-10-26, 10-3-2016)
10-16-1-2: COMMUNITY CHARACTER:
   A.   One of the biggest challenges for community development is the need to
encourage residential development and growth, while attempting to preserve the
best qualities of the village's character. Antioch for generations was defined
by a vibrant downtown and a series of unique neighborhoods adjacent to the
downtown. Like most communities in the Chicago metro area, the community
started to change rapidly when new subdivisions were constructed by regional
and national builders. Today, large tracts of previous farmland have been
transformed into residential subdivisions.
   B.   With its rolling terrain, lakes, wetlands and surrounding Lake County
forest preserves, Antioch has the opportunity to guide future growth in a
manner that is consistent with its moniker "authentic by nature". Through
careful planning and the management of future growth, Antioch can become one of
the premier communities in northern Lake County. Based on this goal, the
village is committed in establishing a series of minimum standards for all
future single-family homes in the village.
      1.   To avoid the potential of monotony and the creation of cookie cutter
subdivisions, all builders shall incorporate the following architectural design
elements into new single-family construction.
      2.   All future developments shall be required to submit "architectural
design guidelines" or a "pattern book" showing how their proposed product
complies with the design standards.
      3.   Additionally, all future land plans shall comply with the standards
incorporated into this chapter.

(Ord. 16-10-26, 10-3-2016)
10-16-1-3: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE REALM:
   A.   Public Realm: Recently, the importance of the public realm has often
been lost in community design. The public realm is defined by what one can
observe from the street. The architectural style of the homes, tree canopy,
sidewalk, width of the parkway along with the width of the street all help
define the public realm of a neighborhood.
Too often the contemporary public realm is defined by streets which are too
wide, poor tree canopies and streets dominated by garages. These standards call
for new attention toward the public realm in designing a single-family
neighborhood. The key to creating a great public realm is creating an intimate
outdoor room or creating what has been defined by "enclosure". Streets that are
too wide make it impossible to create an attractive public realm.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2480.jpg]
   B.   Private Realm: The private realm is defined by the area within the four
(4) walls of the private home. Today, regional and national builders have
become experts in creating "great" private realms for the homeowner. As
reflected in the illustrations below, great emphasis has been focused on
creating great master bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, home theater rooms and
family rooms. The design emphasis is on the interior and finishes of the
interior of the home, versus the creation of a great "public realm".
Communities are challenged with the fundamental that home purchasers' budgets
are finite and the exterior elevations of a home are often short changed for
improvements in the house that are not seen within the public realm. But it is
the public realm that defines the quality of a neighborhood and ultimately the
quality of the community.
Based on this fact, these design standards attempt to establish a minimum
investment that builders will have to invest in the exterior elevations facing
the street.

10-16-1-4: CURRENT HOUSING TRENDS AND MARKETS:
   A.   Current Housing Trends: The nation and the region are seeing a recovery
from the housing downturn of 2008 and the great recession. As housing values
recover, the village of Antioch is in a great position to see new housing
starts. Antioch is one of the few communities in Lake County that have existing
"lots" which are available for building. In addition, the village of Antioch
still has vacant land that will attract new residential development in the
future.
The goal of these standards is to encourage new housing and new growth in the
village and to promote "attainable price points" for young families. However,
these standards also attempt to maintain the village's character by
establishing a minimum number of standards that the building community will
have to comply with in the future. These standards should have a minimal impact
on costs, but can have a real impact on the design success of each home.
The current trend with many builders is to draw on the history of different
historic vernacular styles of the great "American" home and to base new
contemporary designs on these historic patterns. While these do not require
builders to follow these vernacular styles, a good place to start is to look at
some of the vernacular styles that can be found in the village of Antioch and
the Chicago metro region. The following standards have outlined some of these
historic vernacular styles as follows:

   B.   Markets:
      1.   Entry: The entry market has been identified for homes between two
hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) and two hundred seventy five thousand
dollars ($275,000.00). These homes generally incorporate simple floor plans and
there is an emphasis on providing a maximum of square footage with a minimum
amount of architectural articulation. Simple rooflines and all vinyl elevations
are generally predominant in these types of homes. Incorporating a sufficient
number of entry homes for young families and public service employees (police,
teachers, firefighters, etc.) is an important part in creating an economically
diverse and vibrant community.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2547.jpg]
      2.   Move Up: The move up market will be critically important to the
village of Antioch. Staff continues to foresee that the majority of new homes
constructed in the village will provide new opportunities to families who are
looking for their second or third homes. Generally defined by price points
between two hundred seventy five thousand dollars ($275,000.00) to three
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00), these homes will attract new
residents who may reside in Lake County, but who are looking for more value.
Antioch will continue to provide better value compared to markets to the south
based on land values and reasonable impact fees from the village.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2549.jpg]
      3.   Estate: This higher end market defined by price points in excess of
three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) will continue to be in
demand based on the long term trends in the village. Currently, Antioch has
several neighborhoods that are large lot, semicustom home neighborhoods. The
area's natural beauty along with the existing lakes, horse farms and large
estate lots will continue to create a demand for custom homes. While staff does
not foresee the whole village becoming a semicustom home market, we believe
that between twenty five percent (25%) to thirty three percent (33%) of the
future home demand in the village could attract this market.

10-16-2: BUILDING DESIGN:
10-16-2-1: MASSING:
Any good single-family design must consider the importance of massing, scale,
proportion and the scale of the building design. The simple placement of
dormers, or how the garage is located, or the incorporation of a well balanced
porch can have a dramatic impact on the success of a single-family home design.
The use of first floor bays, porches and well designed entrances can all have a
positive impact on breaking up the massing of the front elevation.

   A.   One approach in breaking up a home massing is simply moving the front
elevation plane forward or backwards and incorporating multiple planes within
the front elevation. If the house incorporates a three (3) car garage, setting
back the third bay will have a positive impact on the design of the garage.
   B.   Incorporating a prominent and well proportioned entrance on the front
elevation can help break up the massing of a house.
   C.   Well proportioned windows and balanced window placement should be
incorporated on all four (4) elevations.
   D.   Gables should be well proportioned and placed in a balanced manner.
Gables within gables are discouraged.
   E.   Avoid low pitched gables or anything below an eight to twelve (8/12)
pitch.
   F.   Incorporation of a projecting porch can assist in breaking up the front
elevation and minimizing the impact that a two (2) or three (3) car garage can
have on the front elevation.
   G.   Overly complicated rooflines with multiple pitches and hips are
discouraged.
   H.   Projecting elements of any house design should be completed with
balance and symmetry.

10-16-2-2: MATERIALS:
The use of exterior materials is critically important in the overall design of
any single-family home. Historically, the following exterior materials used in
Antioch include vinyl, face brick, cedar clapboard and stucco. While some
communities in the Chicago metro area require a minimum percentage of brick on
all single-family homes, brick does not always create a better design. In lieu
of a minimum brick requirement, staff is proposing a series of standards that
regulate how exterior materials should be applied.
   A.   Architectural grade vinyl shall be required when vinyl is used and all
corners shall incorporate corner trim.
   B.   When face brick is used on front elevation, brick returns shall be
required with a minimum depth of one foot (1').
   C.   The use of vinyl shake or other materials is encouraged to be
incorporated under gables on the second floors to provide additional
architectural interest to front elevations.
   D.   Brick or stone wainscot is encouraged to be incorporated on the front
elevation of single-family homes, specifically key lots or homes located at
corner locations.
   E.   No more than two (2) materials in addition to wood trim should be used
on a single-family elevation. Incorporating too many varying materials on an
elevation can create a wallpaper effect.
   F.   Appropriate materials should be used appropriately based on the
architectural style of the house. As an example, a craftsman home should
incorporate vinyl clapboard and shake, while a federal style should incorporate
a predominance of face brick. Stucco should only be used as an accent material
on elevations.

10-16-2-3: WINDOW TRIM, CORNER BOARDS AND BAND BOARDS:
Simple incorporation of wood trim around windows, corner boards and band boards
can have a dramatically positive impact on the design of an elevation and
provide architectural articulation and texture to a simple design. Too often
builders simply ignore these small details. The following design elements shall
be required on all new single-family homes within the village:
   A.   Eaves: All houses shall incorporate eaves with a minimum depth of one
foot (1') on all four (4) sides.
   B.   Window Trim: All exterior windows shall incorporate wood trim around
the window with a minimum width of six inches (6").
   C.   Returns: All front brick elevations shall incorporate brick returns
with a minimum width of one foot (1').
   D.   Corner Boards: All houses shall incorporate corner boards that use
vinyl or cedar clapboard.
   E.   Band Boards: Band boards located between the first and second floors
are encouraged to be incorporated on all four (4) elevations.

10-16-2-4: ROOFLINES:
A good streetscape can be impacted by the rooflines of individual homes. Too
often, a street will look like a series of "barracks" with a uniform line of
monotonous homes with a uniform roof style, lined up like soldiers with no
variation or architectural interest. To avoid this scenario, the following
standards should be complied with:
   A.   No more than one-third (1/3) of any development can incorporate a
single type of roofline, including gables, hips, clipped gables, mansards or
gambrel roofs.
   B.   Multiple roof planes, or the incorporation of usable dormers or
eyebrows are encouraged as an architectural design element.
   C.   Architectural grade shingles are required on all new construction.
   D.   A roof pitch of thirty (30) to forty five degrees (45°) is recommended
for new construction.
   E.   Gable pitches on front elevations should incorporate a 10/12 angle.
   F.   All rooflines should incorporate a minimum eave line of one foot (1')
which will create a shadow line along the roofline.
   G.   Clipped gables above garages or the main entrance of a home are
encouraged.

10-16-2-5: GARAGES:
The location and configuration of the garage is critically important in the
overall design of a single-family home and the character of the streetscape. A
poorly placed garage can destroy the front elevation of a home and often
defines the character of a house facing the street. The following design
standards attempt to soften the impact that the garage has on the front
elevation by incorporating a simple number of changes to garage design:
   A.   Garage doors shall be either recessed or project no more than five feet
(5') from the front entrance or front entrance porch.
   B.   Garages located on the front elevation facing the street should not
incorporate more than one-third (1/3) of the linear length of the front house
elevation.
   C.   Windows should be located in a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the
total number of garages located within a development.
   D.   Corner lots should incorporate side loaded garages.
   E.   Garage doors should incorporate architectural elements and blank garage
doors should be avoided.
   F.   Overhangs, arbors, pergolas, keystones or other architectural elements
should be incorporated above garages to provide architectural variation and
texture.
   G.   Side loaded garages are encouraged to be used mid block. This is an
effective way of breaking up garage door monotony.
   H.   Varying setbacks of homes can also help minimize the impact of the
garage on a streetscape.

10-16-2-6: ENTRY LEVEL HOMES:
   A.   Design: One of the biggest design challenges today is constructing an
attractive "entry level" home product in the Chicago market. The national
builders' "entry level" product is generally forty foot (40') wide homes with a
dominant garage, which often takes up fifty percent (50%) of the front
elevation. The proliferation of this product in the past ten (10) years
throughout the metro area can be explained by the fact that they are relatively
simple and inexpensive to construct, but they provide the homeowners with large
rooms and an open floor plan.
This product offers the first time homeowners with the opportunity to purchase
a single-family home and every community needs an entry level product. The
policy question is whether the village of Antioch needs more entry level homes
in the market or whether the new home market is more of a move up market? This
is more of a policy question that these standards do not attempt to address.
Instead, staff is attempting to establish a series of design criteria for all
future single-family home construction that would make sure a minimum design
standard is created. A well designed home should not depend on the price point.
Instead there are a number of simple changes to any elevation which can have a
dramatic impact on the success of a design.

   B.   Discouraged: The following homes reflect the current trends in the
Chicago market for entry level homes. As the following illustrations reflect,
simple floor plans can produce a monotonous design which can have long term
negative impacts on property values within a neighborhood and community.
Figures 1 and 2 of this section show the results of creating affordable housing
with no design sensitivity. Large blank areas of vinyl create a really negative
impact on the streetscape. Simply following the design standards within this
chapter can have a positive impact on the overall quality of design.

Alternative Design Approach
   C.   Encouraged: Figures 3 and 4 of this section show how a simple elevation
or entry level home can be improved by simply incorporating a number of design
elements as highlighted below:

IMAGES/0-0-0-2628.jpg]
Good example of national home production
      1.   The balanced and appropriate use of face brick below a projecting
gable can provide relief to the front elevation and soften the overall design
of the front elevation.
      2.   Breaking the front plane and providing architectural relief is
critical to the success of the design, unless it is a traditional elevation
(federal style, salt box, etc.).
      3.   Incorporation of a higher pitched gable with a frieze board and a
minimum eave line of one foot (1') can provide architectural articulation and a
shadow line along the roofline. This is critically important to the overall
success of the design of a house.
      4.   A projecting porch or overhang over the main entrance can provide
architectural relief and break up the plane of the front elevation.
      5.   Balanced window placement and traditional window fenestration can
provide interest and movement to an elevation.
      6.   Garages should either be offset from the front elevation or
incorporate a number of design elements in order to minimize their impact on a
front elevation. Design elements can vary from individual bay doors, windows,
projections or overhangs over the garage, or recessed garage plane from the
front porch.
      7.   Incorporation of brick soldier courses and keystones above windows
or garage can provide additional architectural variation to a front elevation.
      8.   Substantial foundation landscaping and an ornamental tree in the
front yard can also soften an elevation over time and provide the streetscape
with visual interest. (Ord. 16-10-26, 10-3-2016)
10-16-2-7: EXTERIOR UPGRADES:
The starter house or entry level market often ends up creating cookie cutter
subdivisions as national or regional builders come into a community, quickly
build a subdivision and leave town. Often, the results end up as being a
problem subdivision or neighborhood with declining property values and numerous
maintenance issues. To avoid this possibility, these design standards are
intended to ensure that builders incorporate a minimum number of exterior
upgrades to single-family elevations:
   A.   Builders shall be required to submit a "pattern book" outlining their
proposed models and elevations of their proposed single-family homes as part of
any planned unit development (PUD) or annexation into the village of Antioch.
   B.   The design standards related to massing, window fenestration/trim,
garage design, rooflines, eaves, trim and band boards, corner boards and the
use of brick returns as outlined in this chapter shall be standards and shall
be required to be incorporated into PUD agreements and future annexation
agreements.
   C.   Developers shall be required to comply with the following residential
subdivision design guidelines and incorporate ten percent (10%) of their lots
as key lots and designate any lot adjacent to a collector, major collector or
arterial as a through lot.
   D.   All builders shall be required to submit a landscape plan for each lot
with one parkway tree, an ornament tree in the front yard, a minimum of six (6)
foundation shrubs and a shade tree in the rear yard.

10-16-3: SUBDIVISION DESIGN:
Taking an existing subdivision which has already been developed and
incorporating a number of small modifications to the plan will help the
development community obtain a sense of what the village is looking for in
future residential development:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/76feed42cd5168afd9f180669af5a73c3b7a7872/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2640.jpg]
   A.   Incorporating a well connected street plan with good interconnection is
critical in future residential developments within the village. The exception
to this guideline is conservation developments or developments located on
unique topography.
   B.   Subdivision designers should make every effort to minimize cul-de-sacs
in future plans.
   C.   If a park is necessary, it should be centrally located and every effort
should be made to create terminal vistas of the park.
   D.   Future residential development should incorporate through lots (any
single-family home backing up to a collector street) and key lots (homes
located at important locations within the development). (Ord. 16-10-26, 10-3-
2016)
10-16-3-1: CONSERVATION DESIGN:
Unique parcels of land with extensive woodlands, wetlands or terrain should
incorporate elements of conservation design as highlighted in figures 1A and 1B
of this section.

10-16-4: DESIGN STANDARDS:
10-16-4-1: RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Street Designs:
      1.   The following guidelines should be followed when new residential
developments are being proposed in the village of Antioch. Extensive efforts
should be made to integrate single- family neighborhoods into the unique
terrain of the village. Specifically, efforts should be made to preserve mature
groves of trees and unique view sheds of open space.
      2.   Conservation design, as section
10-16-3-1, figures 1A and 1B of this chapter demonstrate, should be used on
property which incorporates mature groves of trees or unique terrain that
should be preserved as open space. Instead of cutting mature tree groves down
or destroying unique rolling terrain, development should be clustered and open
space preserved whenever possible.
      3.   Standard development patterns should incorporate the following
design standards:
         a.   Residential subdivision plans should integrate a street network
and cul-de-sacs should be minimized within any plan.
         b.   Outside the downtown, subdivision plans should incorporate some
curvilinear aspect and long unbroken straight streets should be avoided if
possible.
         c.   In the downtown, any infill project should incorporate short,
straight street segments, connected by ninety degree (90°) turns, thus creating
a more formal or traditional neighborhood.
         d.   If a park is required, it should be centrally located if possible
and streets should terminate into the park, thus creating a terminal vista of
open space within the development.
         e.   Single loaded streets facing open space or green areas are
encouraged.
         f.   The incorporation of terminal vistas of open space should be
incorporated into any land plan whenever possible. The best terminal vistas are
"T" intersections that line up with a view of open space, a village green, some
water feature or other design parameter that provides additional character to
the overall quality of design.

(Ord. 16-10-26, 10-3-2016)
10-16-4-2: SUBDIVISION DESIGN:
   A.   Street interconnection is critical to any successfully designed
subdivision. All developers should incorporate a minimum of one stub street to
any adjacent development or vacant undeveloped parcel. The following design
guidelines generally recommend a minimum of two (2) stub streets into any
adjacent parcel if possible:
      1.   All future subdivisions should be designed as stand alone
neighborhoods and will consist of a local street network that provides
adjoining links to other adjacent neighborhoods through both pedestrian and
vehicular traffic.
      2.   Multiple street entrances in and out of each neighborhood are
strongly encouraged.
      3.   Each neighborhood, if at all possible, should incorporate a
neighborhood park, or alternatively a series of pocket parks which help break
up the development and provide vistas of open space throughout the development.
      4.   Collector streets that run through any neighborhood should
incorporate traffic calming design elements and should be designed as a
"complete street".
      5.   Boulevards at entrances and adjacent to parks are encouraged as a
way of traffic calming and slowing traffic down. In addition, boulevards bring
beauty to a neighborhood.

10-16-4-3: LOTS:
   A.   Through Lots: Single-family lots that back up to arterials or
collectors should incorporate additional architectural elements on the rear of
homes and are identified as "through lots". These homes have a large impact on
the visual character of a village and every effort should be made to avoid
blank vinyl walls with a minimum number of windows. The following design
elements should be considered:
      1.   Balanced windows and window shutters.
      2.   Projections, breakfast rooms or the use of different materials on
the elevations.
      3.   Brick chimney chase.
      4.   Extensive landscape and a unified fence design.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2660.jpg]
   B.   Key Lots: A "key lot" should be a home within a neighborhood that
incorporates additional architectural or landscaping elements. Approximately
ten percent (10%) of the homes within any new subdivision should be a "key
lot". Key lots should be located at important intersections, at a "T
intersection" or along parks or open space. The following design elements
should be considered:
      1.   Higher percentage of face brick on the front and side elevation.
      2.   Prominent porches or wrap around porches.
      3.   Wainscot of brick or stone on the front and corner side elevations.

the following criteria:
      1.   The area contains one (1) or more buildings, structures, or sites
meeting the criteria for landmark designation, and may also include other
buildings, structures or sites which, although they may not qualify for
individual landmark designation, contribute to the overall visual character of
the area and to its architectural or historic significance;
      2.   The area is historically, economically, or culturally significant to
the development of Antioch;

boundaries, shall be made by ordinance, which shall include the legal
description of the area to be included within the historic district.
   G.   Classification of an individual property as a landmark, contributing,
or non-contributing within a designated historic district may be modified based
on significant alterations, whether man-made or acts of nature.
   H.   No nomination application relating to the same district will be
entertained by the commission for twelve (12) months following denial. (Ord.
19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-17-5: CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS:
   A.   Concept Review:
      1.   Purpose: A concept plan may be submitted for the purpose of
obtaining the historic preservation commission's comments and recommendations
prior to the owner spending significant time and expense in the preparation of
detailed plans and architectural drawings and applying for a certificate of
appropriateness.
      2.   Procedure: The property owner requesting a concept review shall
submit a preliminary drawing of any exterior alterations or construction,
current photographs of the property, historic photographs (if available), a map
or survey showing locations of all structures on the property, and a list of
proposed materials. The owner shall present the concept plan at a commission
meeting.
      3.   After discussion with the owner, the commission may make a
preliminary determination whether the proposed work complies with the
established criteria and may make recommendations as to any changes that would
bring the proposal into compliance.
   B.   Certificate Of Appropriateness: When Required:
      1.   Except as provided herein, a certificate of appropriateness is
required prior to issuance of a permit for minor and major work involving any
new and other construction, alteration, repair, demolition, relocation or other
material change that may affect the exterior architectural appearance of any
structure or site within an historic district or of any designated landmark
building or site.
      2.   An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall not be
required for certain projects. Projects which do not require a certificate of
appropriateness include, but are not limited to, those listed below:
         a.   Change in exterior paint schemes or colors;
         b.   Ordinary repair and maintenance of existing exterior
architectural features which do not permanently alter or modify the features
and do not require a building permit;
         c.   Replacement of existing outside storage sheds;
         d.   Installation, removal, or change in landscaping;
         e.   Repairs to private concrete or asphalt sidewalks, and all
sidewalks, curbs, streetlights, fire hydrants and street signs within the
public right of way;
         f.   Replacement of existing mechanical and electrical service
equipment.
      3.   The requirement for a certificate of appropriateness may be waived
in emergency circumstances which require immediate relief, repair, or
demolition, where the fire chief or building official certifies that such
conditions exist and that said conditions can be eliminated as quickly as is
needed only if the certificate of appropriateness is waived.
      4.   In the event any building, structure, or other feature should be
damaged by fire or other calamity, or by act of nature, or by the public enemy
to such an extent that, in the opinion of the aforesaid official or officials,
it cannot reasonably be repaired and restored, it may be removed or demolished
in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws. Divisions 3
and 4 shall apply only in cases where it is impractical for the commission to
review a certificate of appropriateness.
   C.   Certificate Of Appropriateness: Procedure:
      1.   Where a certificate of appropriateness is required, the community
development department shall furnish applicants with an application for a
certificate of appropriateness.
      2.   Within ten (10) days following receipt by the community development
department of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
community development department shall notify the chairperson of the historic
preservation commission.
      3.   The commission shall review an application for a certificate of
appropriateness within twenty one (21) days after notification by the community
development department. Plans and specifications for exterior work submitted
with the permit application shall be made available to the commission. The
community development department shall notify the applicant of the time and
place of the meeting.
      4.   Tabling the application shall be considered action by the commission
provided, however, that any such delay shall not exceed twenty one (21) days
unless the applicant has not provided the additional documentation or expert
technical advice requested.
      5.   The commission may table the application for a certificate of
appropriateness if it finds that additional documentation or expert technical
advice from outside its membership is needed to properly evaluate the
application. The commission may hold an additional meeting or meetings to
consider the application not more than twenty one (21) days from receipt of all
requested documentation and technical advice.
      6.   The commission shall approve an application for a certificate of
appropriateness for projects where it is required and that meet the applicable
criteria for "minor work." These projects include, but are not necessarily
limited to, the following:
         a.   Addition of outside storage and mechanical and electrical service
equipment not visible from a public street or sidewalk either because of
location or landscaping;
         b.   Application or use of exterior roofing materials of the same
kind, type, or texture as that already in use, if appropriate;
         c.   Improvements, alterations, and renovations that can be
accomplished without obtaining a building permit, including, but not limited
to, screening and siding using the same material as when the building was first
constructed;
         d.   Erection, alteration, or removal of features associated with a
physical or medical condition of an occupant, clients or customers, but which
do not permanently alter exterior features, including access ramps or lifts;
         e.   Replacement of fences of the same type and material in the same
location;
         f.   Installation of or change in, storm doors, storm windows, and
screens;
         g.   Other such projects that are determined to be minor work, either
through consistent interpretation of this chapter, or by determination of
either the historic preservation commission or the village board.
      7.   If the commission finds that the work proposed in the application
meets the applicable criteria of division D of this section, and is considered
"major work" that will not impair the integrity of contributing structures
within a historic district, it shall recommend to the village board approval of
a certificate of appropriateness. The recommendation shall state its findings
and reasoning, which will be forwarded to the village board.
      8.   If the commission finds on a preliminary basis that the work
proposed in the application does not meet the applicable criteria of this
article, it may make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes that
would cause the work proposed in the application to meet the applicable
criteria and may confer with the applicant in an attempt to resolve any
differences between the applicant's plan and the applicable criteria.
      9.   a.   If the commission finds that the work proposed in the
application does not meet the applicable criteria and will therefore adversely
affect or destroy historically or architecturally significant features of a
landmark or of a building, structure, or site within a designated historic
district, it shall recommend denial of a certificate of appropriateness. The
recommendation shall state its findings and reasoning, which will be forwarded
to the village board.
         b.   Upon subsequent denial, the applicant may submit an amended
application to address the findings and recommendations of the commission and
the village board. If the commission finds that the amended application
conforms to the findings and recommendations of the commission and the village
board and to the applicable criteria set forth in this chapter, it shall issue
a certificate of appropriateness, and no further action by the village board
will be necessary.
      10.   A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if:
         a.   Changes have been made to the plans subsequent to the approval of
the commission or village board; or
         b.   The permit issued for the work becomes invalid. A certificate of
appropriateness remains in force for the same period of validity as the permit.
      11.   The applicant may apply for a certificate of economic hardship upon
denial of a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to the following section.
   D.   Certificate Of Appropriateness: Criteria: In deciding whether to
recommend approval or denial of an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by the following criteria:
      1.   The significance of a site, structure, or building:
         a.   The commission shall apply the maximum flexibility allowed by
this chapter in its review of applications for new construction and for
alteration, removal, or demolition of structures that have little architectural
or historic significance. However, if the new construction, alteration, removal
or demolition would seriously impair or destroy historically or architecturally
significant features of a landmark or of a building, structure, or site within
a designated historic district, the commission shall give due consideration to
protection of those historically and architecturally significant features.
         b.   The following properties are presumed to have architecturally or
historically significant features: 1) properties within a designated historic
district that are classified as architecturally or historically significant by
a survey conducted pursuant to the duties assigned to the commission; 2)
properties designated as landmarks pursuant to sections of this chapter; and 3)
all properties listed on the national register of historic places.
         c.   The following properties will sometimes have architecturally or
historically significant features: properties within a designated historic
district that are classified as architecturally or historically contributing
pursuant by a survey conducted pursuant to the duties assigned to the
commission and pursuant to this code.
         d.   The following properties will usually have little architectural
or historic significance: properties within a designated historic district that
are classified as architecturally or historically non-contributing by a survey
conducted pursuant to the duties assigned to the commission and pursuant this
code.
      2.   General Design Guidelines:
         a.   Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction
should be compatible with the style and character of the structure and with
surrounding structures.
         b.   Proportions Of The Front Facade: The relationship between the
width of a building and the height of the front elevation should be compatible
with surrounding structures.
         c.   Proportions Of Windows And Doors: The proportions and
relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the
architectural style and character of the building.
         d.   Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces: The relationship of a
structure to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be
compatible.
         e.   Roof Shapes: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should
be compatible with the architectural style and character of the building and
with adjoining structures.
         f.   Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration, construction,
or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and
character and with the surrounding structures.
         g.   Directional Expression: Facades in historic districts should
blend with and reflect the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of
adjacent structures. The directional expression of a building after alteration,
construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its original
architectural style and character.
         h.   Architectural Details: Architectural details should be treated so
as to make a building compatible with its original architectural style and
character and to not detract from the inherent characteristics of surrounding
structures.
         i.   Appurtenances: New, replaced, or restored appurtenances shall be
sensitive to the individual building or structure, its occupants, and their
needs.
         j.   New Structures: New structures in a historic district shall be
compatible with, but need not be the same as, the architectural styles and
general designs and layouts of the surrounding structures.
      3.   The U.S. Secretary Of The Interior's Standards For Rehabilitation:
         a.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in
a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
         b.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
         c.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
         d.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance shall be retained and preserved.
         e.   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
         f.   Deteriorated historical features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
         g.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
         h.   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation

CHAPTER 18
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
SECTION:
10-18-1: Traditional Neighborhood Development Standards
10-18-2: Commercial Guidelines
10-18-1: TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
Traditional Neighborhood Developments are intended to provide current residents
and future residents with the opportunity to reside in pedestrian friendly
neighborhoods that incorporate a mixture of uses. Included in this mixture of
uses are a wide variety of housing options including single-family, duplexes,
townhomes, apartments, and accessory dwelling units. The following standards
are intended to guide the development community on the various design standards
that should be followed when proposing a Traditional Neighborhood Development:
   A.   Mixed Use: TND developments should integrate a mix of uses ranging from
single-family, duplexes, townhomes, apartments, accessory dwelling units, and
commercial/office, civic, religious, and open space.
   B.   Density: Generally, traditional neighborhood developments should
incorporate a density range between five (5) to twelve (12) units per gross
acre. This density range provides for opportunities for single-family,
duplexes, townhomes, apartments, court-yard homes, apartments, accessory
dwelling units, and commercial.
   C.   Pedestrian Sheds: TND's should be designed within a quarter mile
perimeter or a fifteen (15) minute walking area in order to create a pedestrian
friendly, compact, and intimate neighborhood feel.
   D.   Interconnected Streets: Streets design within a TND should be designed
in an interconnected manner and cul-de-sacs are discouraged unless the
topography requires them.
   E.   Blocks: Block length should have a maximum length of five hundred feet
(500') and a block perimeter should be limited to a maximum of one thousand six
hundred feet (1,600').
   F.   Parking: Garage should be located to the rear of the homes. Either
alleys, motor courts, detached garages or garages setback at least twenty feet
(20') from the front building line shall be permitted. Street parking is
encouraged, and on-street parking can be counted towards any required parking
as outlined in this title for traditional neighborhood developments.
   G.   Building Design:
      1.   Traditional neighborhood development buildings should be front
loaded with a maximum build-to-line of ten feet (10') in the front adjacent to
any right of way. Structures should incorporate prominent entrances that are
centrally located along with a balanced window pattern. Rooflines should
incorporate simple lines and excessive use of gables is discouraged. Roof
slopes should incorporate a minimum of 8/12 slopes, unless the design style
dictates a lower slope (Prairie, Craftsman,). Single-family homes are
encouraged to incorporate a usable porch in front of the house with minimum of
eight foot (8') width and if privacy is a concern, porches should be elevated.
      2.   While simple traditional design is encouraged, no architectural
style is mandated within these standards. The most important design element is
the creation on an intimate streetscape which dictates a sense of enclosure
between the street, parkway trees, front setback/and front elevation of the
home. Any fence or hedge in the front yard should not have a height that
exceeds three feet (3').

IMAGES/0-0-0-3050.png]
 
   H.   Accessory Dwelling: One (1) accessory dwelling per detached home shall
be permitted by right. Accessory units should be incorporated above the garage
or located in the backyard of a single-family home. Living areas should not
exceed eight hundred (800) square feet and ADU's should not count towards the
allowable square footage of a single-family home. Accessory dwelling units
should have separate entrances from the main entrance of a single-family home.
(Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)
10-18-2: COMMERCIAL GUIDELINES:
Commercial neighborhood centers within a TND should be located along a
collector street or in the center of a neighborhood and should cater to the
daily needs of the residents within the neighborhood or adjacent neighborhoods.
If designed properly, a commercial neighborhood center can become a true "third
place" and attract residents throughout the community if designed properly.
Commercial neighborhood centers should follow the standards as highlighted
below:
   A.   Parking: Parallel or angle parking should be located on both sides of
the street adjacent to any commercial neighborhood center. Off-street parking
minimums do not exist for commercial neighborhood centers within a TND
district. However, off-street parking is permitted if appropriate and required
by the businesses within the neighborhood center. Including street parking,
there should be one (1) parking space for every five hundred (500) square feet
of commercial/office development within a neighborhood center.
   B.   Parking Location: Off-street parking lots in front of buildings within
a commercial neighborhood center is prohibited. If off-site parking exists,
seventy five percent (75%) of the off-site parking must be in the rear of any
structure and twenty five percent (25%) may be located on the side of the
structure. Where possible, adjacent parking lots should connect and should be
broken into smaller areas with landscaping or other design techniques. In
addition, extensive landscaping should be incorporated along the perimeter of
any off-site parking that can be seen from the street. One (1) shade tree for
every ten (10) parking space should be planted along the perimeter of the off-
site parking lot.
   C.   Building Design:
      1.   Buildings should use zero setbacks in order to create a wall of
buildings that mirror the classic "American Main Street" design approach. In
addition, buildings should incorporate between sixty percent (60%) to eighty
percent (80%) windows (glazing) along the first floor adjacent to any sidewalk
or area visible from the street. Ten foot (10') to twelve foot (12') sidewalks
are required in commercial neighborhood centers along with street trees planted
every forty feet (40'). Buildings should incorporate awnings, covered walkways,
arcades, or recessed entrances. Quality materials including face brick, glass,
fiber cement board, or stucco shall be used.
      2.   Mixed use buildings are encouraged and up to four (4) stories shall
be permitted as right within any commercial neighborhood center. Residential or
office are limited to the second floors.
   D.   Signs: Only one (1) wall sign per store space or alternatively an
awning with signage shall be permitted in the commercial neighborhood center.
All signs should within the district shall be individual letters with back-
lighting or sandblasted signs of natural wood or HDU board. All signs should be
designed to be pedestrian scaled and proportioned to any building they are
placed on. Internally illuminated or electronic message board signs shall be
prohibited. (Ord. 19-12-43, 1-13-2020)

ordinances, rules and regulations which have been adopted within this code, and
that any provision of the CCRs that is more restrictive than that within this
code is the responsibility of the homeowners' association or some other private
entity(ies).
Should the developer, owner or his successor in interest develop the
subdivision in separate phases, the original declarations of covenants,
conditions and restrictions of record shall state that when any subsequent
phase in the subdivision is finalized by the recording of a final plat for that
particular phase, the owner or his successors shall prepare an instrument
legally sufficient to subject the new phase to the original declarations of
covenants, conditions and restrictions of record and the existing homeowners'
association.
A phased development is one where only a portion of the entire approved
subdivision will be developed at any one time.

of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the plan commission
and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and
the conditions of the conditional approval, if any.
   G.   Prior to the acceptance of any final plan for a subdivision, the
owners, developers and the like, must comply, where applicable, with the

   L.   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
as specified in the table of minimum standards. The plan commission may permit
comparable cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners.
   M.   Street right of way widths shall be as specified in the table of
minimum standards for street design in this section.
   N.   Half width street rights of way are prohibited.
   O.   Dead end streets (cul-de-sacs), designed to be so permanently, shall
not be longer than five hundred feet (500') from the intersection of the origin
through the center of the circle to the end of the right of way, and shall be
provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside pavement
diameter of at least eighty feet (80') and a street property line diameter of
at least one hundred feet (100'). In nonresidential areas, the cul-de-sac shall
be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside pavement
diameter of at least one hundred twenty feet (120') and a street property line
diameter of at least one hundred fifty feet (150').
   P.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be projected
wherever possible. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the plan
commission.
   Q.   Street gradients and vertical curves shall be as specified in the table
of minimum standards for street design in this section. Variations from this
design standard may be approved by the village engineer based upon the unique
features of the site without the necessity of variation proceeding.
   R.   Street grades shall provide proper relation between the street and the
first floor elevation of the houses or buildings and permit convenient and
economical access to and drainage of the lots. (1976 Code § 152.016)

the village with an overall map of the subdivision showing the proper size
culvert for each lot driveway as determined from hydraulic calculations.
(1976 Code § 152.016; amd. Ord. 02-12-46, 12-2-2002)
11-3-3: ALLEYS:
   A.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial, business and industrial
districts, except that the plan commission may waive this requirement where
other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-
street loading, unloading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the
uses proposed.
   B.   Alleys in residential areas shall not be permitted, except where deemed
necessary and on the recommendation of the plan commission.
   C.   The width of an alley, where permitted, shall be twenty feet (20') in
residential areas and thirty feet (30') in commercial, business and industrial
districts.
   D.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alley alignment shall be
avoided, but, where necessary, corners may be cut off sufficiently to permit
safe vehicular movements.
   E.   Dead end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the plan commission. (1976 Code § 152.017)
11-3-4: EASEMENTS:
   A.   Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least ten feet (10')
wide.
   B.   Easements shall be designed to provide continuity from block to block.
   C.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel
or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right of
way conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse and shall
include such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for
the purpose and as determined by the plan commission. Parallel streets or
parkways may be required in connection therewith. (1976 Code § 152.018)
11-3-5: BLOCKS:
   A.   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
      1.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated.
      2.   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions within the
corporate limits of the village.
      3.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
      4.   Limitations and opportunities of topography. (1976 Code § 152.019)
   B.   Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand eight hundred feet
(1,800'), nor be less than six hundred feet (600'). In planned unit
developments greater than two hundred (200) acres, in lieu of the standards in
this subsection, site specific block lengths may be approved in connection with
the approval of the planned unit development. (Ord. 02-09-29, 9-9-2002)
   C.   Pedestrian crosswalks not less than ten feet (10') wide shall be
required where deemed necessary by the plan commission to provide for
pedestrian circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation and other community facilities.
   D.   Blocks or portions thereof intended for commercial or industrial use
shall be designated as such, and the plan shall show adequate off-street areas
to provide for parking, loading docks and other such facilities. (1976 Code §
152.019)
11-3-6: LOTS:
   A.   The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate
for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
   B.   Lot dimensions and areas shall conform to the requirements of the
zoning code; however, the following rules shall also apply:
      1.   Minimum lot sizes for residential lots not served by public sanitary
sewers and water supply shall be determined, using criteria listed in table
entitled, Limitations for Septic Tank Systems in subsection
11-4-3A of this title.
      2.   Where usual soil conditions or other physical factors exist which
may impair the health and safety of the residents of the neighborhood in which
a subdivision may be located, upon recommendation of the state department of
public health, the plan commission may increase lot area requirements as may be
necessary.
      3.   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall
have minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate building site
and to afford the minimum usable area required in this chapter or the zoning
code for front, rear and side yards.
      4.   Depths and widths of lots or properties reserved or laid out for
commercial, business or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for
the off-street service and parking facilities required in the zoning code.
   C.   Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets on which they
abut.
   D.   Within the corporate limits of the village, all lots shall abut on a
publicly dedicated street.
   E.   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where
essential to provide separation of residential development from highways or
primary thoroughfares or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet (10'), and across
which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of
lots abutting such highways and primary thoroughfares or other disadvantageous
use.
   F.   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
   G.   All lots shall front directly on and have access to an approved street.
The plan commission may prohibit access where an alternate means of access is
available. A notation shall appear on the final plat where access is prohibited
or restricted. (1976 Code § 152.020)
11-3-7: BUILDING SETBACK LINES:
   A.   Building setback lines in residential areas of new subdivisions shall
conform to the front yard provisions of the zoning code.
   B.   A corner lot shall maintain not less than the minimum building setback
lines required on both streets on which the lot abuts. (1976 Code § 152.021)
11-3-8: PARKS AND PUBLIC AREAS:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat
of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required to
dedicate land for park and recreational purposes, to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu
of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the
village in accordance with the following criteria and formula.
The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof required by this
section shall also be required as a condition to the annexation of any land to
the village and provisions therefor shall be incorporated in any preannexation
agreement governing such land. (1976 Code § 152.022)
   A.   Park And Recreation Land Dedication Criteria:
      1.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be thirteen (13) acres of land per one
thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the "Table Of
Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit" located in section
11-3-10 of this chapter.
      2.   Location: The comprehensive plan of the village, as adopted by the
village board of trustees, shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A
park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres
shall be considered a requirement. A central location which will serve equally
the entire development is most desirable. In large developments these sites can
be located throughout the development according to established standards for
park area distances.
      3.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas:
         a.   When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for
recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development a
portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit
developments may at the option of the village board of trustees be provided in
the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space. The
extent of same shall be determined by the village board of trustees, based upon
the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and
recreation land for the general area.
         b.   In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated
parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the
installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer
as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including
specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village,
and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or
developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be
permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal
documents. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it
will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have
been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then
subtract the credit to be given.
   B.   Contribution In Lieu Of Park Sites Criteria: Where the development is
small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available
land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes, the village shall
require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the
land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation
land dedication shall be held in trust by the village or other public body
designated by the village solely for the acquisition of park and recreation
land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to serve the immediate
or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the
improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already
serves such needs. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and
recreation land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein
within seven (7) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the
developer who made such contribution.
The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value
of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise
would have been dedicated as park and recreation sites. The developer shall
submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the
area of his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of
the fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the
village board of trustees based upon such information submitted by the
subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the
village board of trustees by the park board or others. (Ord. 08-07-16, 7-21-
2008)
   C.   Dedication And Fee Criteria: There will be situations in subdivisions
or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a
contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise
when:
      1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land
that would have been required to be dedicated;
      2.   A major part of the local park or recreation site has already been
acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to
complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
   D.   Density Formula:
      1.   The tables set out in section
11-3-10 of this chapter are generally indicative of current and short range
projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in
calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash
contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by
the subdivider or developer.
      2.   In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to
the table of estimated ultimate population listed in section
11-3-10 of this chapter, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned
unit development and in that event final determination of the density formula
to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board of trustees
based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or
developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by
the park board or others. It is recognized that population density, age
distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific
formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as
stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
   E.   Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the comprehensive plan or the
standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land
in a particular subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is
required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall
be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body
designated by the village provided that such acquisition is made within one
year from the date of approval of the final plat.
   F.   Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned
unit development is less than forty (40) acres, public open space which is to
be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from
adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas without
hardship on a particular developer.
   G.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not
differ greatly from surrounding land.
   H.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for
full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed
drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or
acceptable provision made therefor. The sidewalks and trees normally included
within the definition of improved sites may be deleted due to the delay time
between dedication of any such school site and construction of school
facilities thereon. (1976 Code § 152.022)
11-3-9: SCHOOL SITES:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   Since 1988, land developers have annexed more than two thousand
(2,000) acres to the village. Within the village, tracts of land exist which
have been or may be subdivided or zoned planned unit development for
residential use which are not subject to an annexation agreement or for which
annexation agreements could expire without land and cash donations having been
met.
      2.   The residential development projected over the next several years
will have a significant impact on the community, including the village. School
districts which provide education to the students residing in the village
include the Antioch Community High School District No. 117, Antioch Community
Consolidated School District No. 34 and Emmons School District No. 33. This
development will cause a greatly increased demand for services and facilities
provided by these entities.
      3.   The developers of new subdivisions and planned unit developments,
and residents thereof, will require village and educational services prior to
the time that tax revenues are generated by said subdivisions and planned unit
developments.
      4.   The development projected will result in the rapid disappearance of
land available for schools and the price of the remaining land will in all
probability increase faster than the borrowing capacity of the various school
taxing bodies responsible for providing school services.
      5.   It is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the village
that:
         a.   Adequate land and facilities are available to provide village
educational services.
         b.   School sites be provided within the village in accordance with
the criteria hereinafter set forth, which are consistent with the minimum
school site recommendations heretofore issued by the various affected school
districts and that funds be provided to the village to defray a portion of the
cost of new school construction.
         c.   The combining of school sites with park sites to provide the
maximum in educational and recreational services and facilities should be
encouraged.
   B.   Definitions:
   DEVELOPER: The owner, lessor, lessee, trustee, heir, executor, assign and
the like.
   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS: The same meaning that is attributable to this
term in this code.
   SCHOOL DISTRICTS: The same meaning that is attributable to this term in this
code.
   C.   Donations Required: Unless otherwise provided for in an annexation
agreement with the village, as a condition of approval of a final plat of
subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider
or developer shall be required to dedicate land and/or make cash contributions
in lieu of land for acquisition of school sites; and cash donations for school
construction, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
subdivision or planned unit development as hereinafter set forth.
   D.   Donations Required From Properties Outside Village Limits: In the event
that land which is subject to subdivision approval by the village is not within
the corporate limits of the village at the time of approval of a final plat of
subdivision for the land, the governing body of any governmental entity which
would be entitled to land and/or cash donations pursuant to this section, may
request that the village vary the terms of this section by allowing said
governmental entity to make its own agreement and/or waiver as to any or all of
the donations and amounts thereof required in this section with the subdivider,
developer and/or owner of said land. Said request shall be made in writing by a
resolution adopted by the governing board of said governmental entity. In such
an event, the village may, by motion, condition subdivision approval upon
compliance with the provisions of this section as the provisions of this
section have been modified by said variation and/or waiver.
   E.   Donations Computed On Projected Population:
      1.   For purposes of computing the amount of land donations or cash
contributions in lieu of land for school sites, and cash donations for school
construction that will be required of each subdivision or planned unit
development to enable the village to provide facilities and services to meet
the needs of such subdivision or planned unit development, its projected
population density shall be computed in accordance with table 1 in section
11-3-10 of this chapter, which is generally indicative of current and short
range projected trends in family size by age groups, number of bedrooms and by
type of residential development such as apartment, single-family detached
housing and the like.
      2.   Table 1 in section
11-3-10 of this chapter shall be used for all population estimates unless a
subdivider or developer files a written objection to the village data, together
with his own demographic study showing the estimated population to be generated
by his subdivision or planned unit development. In that event, the final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be
made by the corporate authorities on the basis of the foregoing village data,
data submitted by the subdivider or developer, and from other sources which may
be submitted to the corporate authorities by the school districts. It is
recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions
change over the years and that said table 1 is subject to periodic review and
amendment, if necessary.
   F.   Land Contribution To School Districts: School sites shall be donated
and conveyed to the village in accordance with the following criteria. The
ultimate number of students that will be generated by the proposed subdivision
or planned unit development shall be determined in accordance with the current
edition of table 1, as set forth in section
11-3-10 of this chapter, adjusted as set forth in subsection E of this section.
      1.   Land Donation To School: The amount of land required to be dedicated
shall be determined by dividing the estimated number of children to each of the
school age brackets hereinafter set forth that will be generated by the
proposed subdivision or planned unit development by the maximum recommended
number of students that can be served in the type of school assigned to such
age bracket, hereinafter set forth, and multiplying the quotient times the
minimum number of acres recommended for a school site, hereinafter set forth.
The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient
land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such
school classification.
      2.   School Classification And Size Of School Site: School
classifications and size of school sites shall be determined in accordance with
the following criteria1:
 
                                                                 Maximum Number Minimum Number

1 Village residents are served by 3 different school districts. In the event that an affected
school district has a different school classification than as shown in the table above, said
school classifications, size of school sites and minimum acres of land shall be modified to
meet the requirements of the affected district.
 
      3.   Improved Sites: Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in
accordance with this title and water retention/detention requirements. All
sites shall be conveyed in a condition ready for all service of electrical,
water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as
applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefor.
The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition of improved
sites may be deferred due to the delay time between conveyance of any such
school sites and construction of school facilities thereon.
      4.   School Land Conveyed To Village: School land conveyed to the village
shall be held by it for transfer to the affected school district or other
entity. Any school land conveyed to the village or thereafter transferred to a
school district or other entity pursuant to this division which is not used for
school purposes within twenty (20) years after it is conveyed to the village
shall be reconveyed to the developer.
   G.   Cash Contribution To School District:
      1.   In addition to the land donation referred to in subsection F of this
section, or a cash contribution in lieu of land referred to in subsection K of
this section, each subdivider or developer shall be required to make a cash
contribution to aid in the provision of necessary funds for the construction,
expansion or rehabilitation of a school for the use of the children who will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development. Subdivision
or planned unit developments shall mean any subdivision in the planning stage
or in existence with plat recorded in the recorder's office. A planned unit
development shall mean any planned unit development in the planning stage or in
existence with a plat recorded in the recorder's office. This section shall
also apply to any owners or owner of a tract of land which is not located in a
subdivision or planned unit development.
      2.   The amount of cash donations for each developer is set out in table
2 in section
11-3-10 of this chapter. The funds and any accrued interest will be apportioned
among the school districts affected by a particular development based on the
number of students estimated to be generated as set forth in table 1 in section
11-3-10 of this chapter.
      3.   In order not to make this requirement over onerous and to assist
developers in meeting this financial responsibility, the cash contributions
required in this section shall be payable upon the issuance of the building
permit for each dwelling unit or upon the sale of an individual lot or a tract
of land by an owner in an arms length transaction. This provision shall not
apply to transfers by way of gift or as a result of a court settlement in a
domestic relations case or in probate matters.
   H.   Distribution Of Plans And Plats: Copies of each subdivision plat or
planned unit development plan shall be transmitted to the park district and the
affected school districts for their written recommendations at the same time
that they are transmitted to the plan commission, but nothing herein contained
shall be construed as requiring receipt of a recommendation prior to action by
the corporate authorities of the village.
   I.   Time Of Conveyance Of Donations: All land donations required pursuant
to this section shall be conveyed no later than the earlier of the following to
occur:
      1.   Within one hundred eighty (180) days after a written demand by the
village.
      2.   The fourth anniversary of the approval of the plat of subdivision or
planned unit development by the village.
   J.   Title Insurance, Survey And Assessment Plats: Each deed or other
instrument conveying land to the village shall be accompanied by the following:
      1.   A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do
business in the state to ensure that grantee has good merchantable title to
such real estate in an amount equal to its value computed pursuant to
subsection K of this section, subject only to then current general real estate
taxes as of the date of transfer; covenants, conditions and restrictions which
do not prohibit the use of the subject real estate for school or park use;
utility easements located within twenty feet (20') of the boundary lines of the
subject real estate; drainage ditches, feeders, laterals and underground pipe
or other conduit.
      2.   A current boundary line survey, certified to the grantee by a state
licensed land surveyor to be in compliance with the Illinois land survey
standards.
      3.   Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed is a lot in
a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in form
acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be
conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number for
exemption purposes.
   K.   Cash Contributions In Lieu Of Land: Criteria for requiring cash
contributions in lieu of land donations:
      1.   Whenever, in the determination of the village, any subdivision or
planned unit development is so small that the school site required under the
provisions of subsections E and F of this section will not be large enough for
practical development and maintenance as school sites, or when the available
land cannot meet the standards set forth in subsections E and F of this
section, or is otherwise inappropriate for a school site, the village shall
require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the
land dedication required.
      2.   The cash contribution to be paid in lieu of land donations for
school sites shall be held in trust by the village or other public body
designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of a school site
to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or
planned unit development, or for reimbursement to the school district for prior
acquisition of a school site for which bonds or other financing obligations are
outstanding which will serve immediate or future needs of children from that
subdivision or planned unit development, or for the improvement of any existing
school site which predominantly serves such needs, including for the
construction, repair or rehabilitation of any school building thereto, or new
construction of facilities.
      3.   All cash donations shall be apportioned among the affected school
districts on a prorata basis determined by the estimated populations to be
generated in the subdivision or planned unit development as set forth in table
1 in section
11-3-10 of this chapter. Said cash contributions are set forth in table 2 in
section
11-3-10 of this chapter.
   L.   Updating Of Required Contributions And Fair Market Value: It is
recognized that population density, age distribution, land values, the cost of
providing school services, construction costs and other local conditions change
over the years. Therefore, the specific formula for the dedication of land, or
the payment of fees in lieu thereof, the required contribution for school
construction, and the fair market value of land in and around the village shall
be reviewed at least every two (2) years and amended if necessary.
   M.   Review Agreements: School agreements previously executed between owner/
developer and the school district shall be reviewed as to the contributions
every two (2) years by the school district and/or the village. In addition,
contributions shall be reviewed at any time that a developer of a subdivision
or a planned unit development is requesting a final approval of a new phase in
a multiphased development.
   N.   Negotiation Authority: The school district shall have the right to
prenegotiate with the developer and to enter into separate written agreements
relative to a lump sum, in advance, cash donation for part or all of the
developer's obligation toward school donations. Said negotiation can have, as a
result, a reduction in the donations required pursuant to this chapter,
provided the developer pays the entire sum agreed upon prior to the issuance of
the first building permit.
   O.   Use Of Contributions: The school district shall be allowed to use all
of the developer's contributions for capital improvements on all existing
school buildings and for construction of new buildings and for purchase of land
for school facilities.
Fees so collected shall not be used for operating expenses, but only capital
expenditures as outlined in this section 1 . (1976 Code § 152.023)

be subject to the average maintained horizontal illumination. These streets
shall have street lighting standards in conformance with these specifications
installed at all street intersections, center of street curve and the end of a
cul-de- sac.
   C.   Installation: It is the intent of this standard to provide for the
installation of a safe, attractive, coherent and easily maintained street
lighting system throughout the village. It is also the intent of this standard
to provide for adequate lighting in off street areas accessible to the driving
public to promote the safe use of such areas and to promote more efficient
public services such as police protection to the properties in and around such
areas.
Lighting systems shall be installed in streets and parking areas in all
developments. Developments abutting a street with substandard lighting shall be
required to provide a street lighting system for the abutting street that meets
the requirements of this standard.
   D.   Design References:
      1.   All residential street lighting systems shall have a Commonwealth
Edison designation for "street, highway and traffic signal lighting", commonly
referred to as "rate 25" as defined by the ComEd schedule of rates for electric
service as filed with the Illinois commerce commission pursuant to state law 1
.
      2.   All residential street lighting systems shall be as approved by the
village. The street lighting shall be owned and maintained by the village of
Antioch following formal acceptance by the village board.
      3.   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to coordinate the
installation of streetlights with that of the other subdivision work.
      4.   Streetlights in residential subdivisions shall be placed at least at
the following locations: all intersections, center of street curve and the end
of a cul-de-sac.
      5.   Commercial streets, parking, plaza and pedestrian lighting systems
will be a designed system which should define the circulation hierarchy of the
commercial development, expose traffic conditions and provide visual
orientation to help both pedestrians and drivers find their way at night.
During the daytime, the repetitive lighting standards should also contribute to
this hierarchy and sense of order. The lighting plan will be designed by a
qualified engineer and approved by the village engineer.
   E.   Testing And Acceptance:
      1.   The village engineer shall test the luminaries for distribution. If
necessary, the contractor shall adjust the luminaries to attain the design
lighting pattern.
      2.   After the foregoing has been completed, project record (as built)
drawings shall be submitted. The street lighting system, and responsibility for
the energy costs, shall be considered accepted by the village only after the
village board has adopted a resolution approving all of the subdivision
improvements. (Ord. 06-06-24, 6-19-2006)

density over twenty thousand (20,000) square feet per dwelling unit, the
village board of trustees, upon recommendation of the plan commission, may
require sidewalks only at selected locations.
   B.   The minimum width of sidewalks shall be four feet (4') along
residential collector streets and residential minor streets where required, and
five feet (5') in commercial and industrial areas and along primary and
secondary streets. All sidewalks shall be of Portland cement concrete
construction in accordance with the "Standard Specifications For Road And

   E.   In lieu of the standards set forth in subsections A and B of this
section, sidewalks shall be provided in planned unit developments of greater
than two hundred (200) acres pursuant to the preliminary plan approved by the
village board of trustees for the planned unit development. (Ord. 02-09-31, 9-
9-2002)
11-4-12: TREES AND VEGETATION:
   A.   All parkways within the dedicated rights of way shall be graded and
seeded or sodded in a manner approved by the village engineer.
   B.   Existing trees and shrubs of substantial size and health shall be
preserved or replanted within the subdivision, to the extent possible, in
conformance with title 8, chapter 6 of this code.
   C.   Street trees shall be planted, as homes are built, throughout the
entire subdivision. Such trees are to be planted within the parkway area, where
the parkway is a minimum of eight feet (8') wide as measured from the sidewalk
to the back of curb. Where parkways are less than eight feet (8') wide, a
landscape easement shall be provided, eight feet (8') in width, along the front
property line for purposes of planting street trees. An average of one tree
shall be planted, or existing tree preserved, for every fifty feet (50') of
frontage on each side of each street. Trees within the parkway must be
deciduous; those planted on private property may be of either deciduous or
coniferous varieties. The new trees to be planted shall be species approved by
the mayor and village board of trustees. Trees shall not be of species
specifically prohibited by title 8, chapter 6 of this code. Each new tree to be
planted shall have a minimum trunk diameter of not less than two inches (2") as
measured at a point twelve inches (12") above the ground line. The developer
shall certify to the village that said trees are free from disease and shall
guarantee said trees for a period of one year from the date of planting. (1976
Code § 152.033)

flush with the ground and planted in such a manner that they will not be
removed by frost.
   B.   Metal monuments three-fourths inch (3/4") in diameter and two feet (2')
in length shall be placed in the ground at all lot corners, intersections of
streets and alleys with platted boundary lines where there is a change in
direction or curvature. All federal, state, county, local or other bench marks,
monuments or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the development shall be
presumed in precise position. All monuments shall be properly set in the ground
before the streets and alleys are accepted by the village. (1976 Code §
152.036)
11-4-14: INCREASED FACILITIES:
Where storm sewer, sanitary sewer or water facilities are made larger than is
immediately required to serve the land described in the final plat, due to the
necessity of service to adjacent and/or presently vacant property as it shall
be developed in the future by others, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for
such additional costs on the following terms and conditions:
   A.   The village engineer shall determine the cost of such storm sewer,
sanitary sewer and/or water facilities as are required to serve only the
immediate needs of the property described in the plat. The village engineer
will also determine the cost of such facilities actually required to serve the
plat in question and the adjacent land when developed.
   B.   The difference in cost in the above determinations shall be paid to the
original developer by the developers of adjacent properties. At the time the
adjacent properties are submitted for subdivision, the village engineer shall
apportion the benefit received by the adjacent property developer by reason of
the increased facilities. The adjacent property developer shall pay the sum of
money equal to his proportionate share of the cost of the increased facilities.
   C.   The village may, as determined by the village board of trustees, act as
the collecting agent in regard to increased facility sharing. In such cases, an
administrative handling charge of five percent (5%) shall be applied to the
adjacent developer's share and retained by the village. Upon receipt of such
proportionate share payment by the adjacent property developer, the village
shall reimburse the developer who originally installed the increased
facilities. (1976 Code § 152.040)

12-2-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Findings:
      1.   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain nonagricultural uses, including, but not limited to,
the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants,
the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and
drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities.
      2.   The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles.
      3.   Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys, washed-
out fills and embankments.
      4.   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt river, streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs.
      5.   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove.
      6.   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage
capacity of flood plains and natural depressions, resulting in increased
chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
   B.   Purpose: The village board of trustees, therefore, declares that the
purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent
damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating
and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any
development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise
results in the movement of earth on land situated in the village. It is the
intent of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by
land disturbing activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which
would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state.
(Ord. 92-11-22, 11-2-1992)

12-2-3: STANDARDS AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
   A.   Standards Adopted By Reference 1 : The standards and specifications
contained in Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
(the yellow book) and the Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control (the green book) cited in section
12-2-4 of this chapter, are hereby incorporated into this chapter and made a
part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods
of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans
approved under section
12-2-4 of this chapter. In the event of conflict between provisions of said
manuals and of this chapter, this chapter shall govern.
   B.   Principles: It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion
and sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating and filling of land in the village. Measures
taken to control soil erosion and off site sediment runoff should be adequate
to assure that sediment is not transported form the site by a storm event of
10-year frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all
development activities within the village and to the preparation of the
submissions required under section
12-2-4 of this chapter:
      1.   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the
site so as to create the least potential erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
      2.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds and
wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
      3.   Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant
from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake,
pond or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these
areas to erosion and sedimentation.
      4.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
      5.   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
      6.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should
be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
      7.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
      8.   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or
downstream.
      9.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and
functional as soon as practical during development.
      10.   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other
land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
      11.   All waste generated as a result of site development activity should
be properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site
by either wind or water.
      12.   All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways. (Ord. 92-11-22, 11-2-1992)

12-2-10: SITE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   On site sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site:
      1.   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures) shall be
constructed to control all off site runoff as specified in referenced
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet
(25'), may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
      2.   For disturbed areas draining more than one but less than five (5)
acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at
the downslope point of the disturbed area.
      3.   For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area.
      4.   Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for both
detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed
of equal volumes of wet detention storage and dry detention storage and each
shall be sized for the two (2) year, twenty four (24) hour runoff from the site
under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the
basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at
least ten (10) hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed
such that it only drains the dry detention storage.
      5.   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment
load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with
a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one year.
For construction periods exceeding one year, the one year sediment load and a
sediment removal schedule may be substituted.
   B.   Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales and
diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 10-year frequency
storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
within forty eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards:
      1.   For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with
mulch, erosion blanket or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod
or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel.
      2.   For grades of four to eight percent (8%), sod or an equivalent
control measure shall be applied in the channel.
      3.   For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, riprap or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively
reduced using drop structures.
   C.   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measure
within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active disturbance or
redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria:
      1.   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding and/or nonvegetative measures.
      2.   Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be
stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding or equivalent.
   D.   Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where
possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements
shall be met:
      1.   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the
maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap
or gravel.
      2.   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to
a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized
within forty eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is completed,
interrupted or stopped.
      3.   Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be
constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted.
   E.   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or
filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications.
   F.   Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of
material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than
twenty five feet (25') to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers,
including straw bales, filter fence or equivalent, shall be installed
immediately on the downslope side of the piles.
   G.   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected
from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately
designed sediment traps or basins or equivalent.
   H.   Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access
drives and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a
public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not
flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled
sediment disposal area.
   I.   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must
be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their
intended function.
   J.   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed
of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved with
permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. (Ord. 92-
11-22, 11-2-1992)
12-2-11: MAINTENANCE OF CONTROL MEASURES:
All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter shall be maintained periodically by the applicant
or subsequent land owner during the period of land disturbance and development
of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance. (Ord. 92-
11-22, 11-2-1992)
12-2-12: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   The building department shall make inspections as hereinafter required
and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the
permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the site development or erosion
and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping,
excavating and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the building
department shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. In
order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance with the approved erosion
and sediment control plan, the grading or building permit, and this chapter,
the permittee shall notify the building department within two (2) working days
of the completion of the construction stages specified below:
      1.   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding
with any other earth disturbance or grading;
      2.   After stripping and clearing;
      3.   After rough grading;
      4.   After final grading;
      5.   After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and
      6.   After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of
sediment controls.
   B.   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be phases or
areas the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion
of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not
made and notification of the results given within five (5) working days after
notice is received by the village from the permittee, the permittee may
continue work at his own risk, without presuming acceptance by the village.
Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at the
site. (Ord. 92-11-22, 11-2-1992)
12-2-13: SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:
   A.   If any stage of the gradIng of any development site the building
department determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that
further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland or drainage structure, the building
department may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that
such reasonable special precaution to be taken as is considered advisable to
avoid the likelihood of such peril. Special precautions may include, but shall
not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils
engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for
further work.
   B.   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on
any development site is not complete, work may be stopped the permittee
required to install temporary structures to take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the building department
may specify the time or starting grading and time of completion or may require
that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion
of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. (Ord.
92-11-22, 11-2-1992)
12-2-14: AMENDMENT OF PLANS:
Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sedimentation control
plans shall be submitted to the building department and shall be processed and
approved or disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field
modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the building department by
written authorization to the permittee. (Ord. 92-11-22, 11-2-1992)
12-2-15: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Exceptions: The zoning board of appeals may, in accordance with the
following procedures, authorize exceptions to any of the requirements and
regulations set forth in this chapter:
      1.   Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition
of the applicant for a site development permit, stating fully the grounds of
the petition and the facts relied upon by the applicant. Such petition shall be
filed with the site development permit application. In order for the petition
to be granted, it shall be necessary that the zoning board of appeals find all
of the following facts with respect to the land referred to in the petition:
         a.   That the land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record, that it
is impossible or impractical for the applicant to comply with all of the
requirements of this chapter;
         b.   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         c.   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property.
      2.   Each application for an exception shall be referred to the building
department for review. The village board of trustees shall transmit is
recommendations to the zoning board of appeals, which shall review such
recommendations prior to granting or denying the exception.
      3.   The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on each
application for exception, within thirty (30) days after receiving application,
in the manner provided with respect to appeals. After public hearing, the
village board of trustees may approve the site development permit application
with the exceptions and conditions it deems necessary or it may disapprove such
site development permit application and exception application or it may take
such other action as appropriate. (Ord. 92-11-22, 11-2-1992)

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the village through the regulation of nonstormwater
discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable as
required by federal and state law. This chapter establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the national
pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit process. The objectives
of this chapter are:

written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drainage
system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drainage system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
      4.   Improper connections in violation of this subsection must be
disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved on site wastewater
management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the authorized
enforcement agency.
      5.   Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps
or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be
located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written
notice of violation from the authorized enforcement agency requiring that such
locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within
which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the
drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and
that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system,
sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these
investigations are to be documented and provided to the authorized enforcement
agency. (Ord. 08-06-13, 6-2-2008)
12-4-7: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
authorized enforcement agency may suspend, without prior notice, MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to the public.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense and is in violation of this chapter if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without
the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 08-06-13, 6-2-
2008)
12-4-8: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION DISCHARGES:
   A.   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
   B.   The operator of a facility, including construction sites, required to
have an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity shall submit a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) to the village at
the same time the operator submits the original notice of intent to the EPA as
applicable.
   C.   The copy of the notice of intent may be delivered to the village either
in person or by mailing it to:
      Notice of Intent to Discharge Stormwater
      Village of Antioch
      874 Main Street
      Antioch, IL 60069
   D.   A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is
discharging stormwater associated with industrial activity without having
submitted a copy of the notice of intent to do so to the village. (Ord. 08-06-
13, 6-2-2008)
12-4-9: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system or associated with
industrial activity, including construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, then the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      3.   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delay in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling programs designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 08-06-13, 6-2-2008)
12-4-10: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES REQUIRED:
The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility that may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment will provide, at its own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of
these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to
the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this
section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan
(SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord.
08-06-13, 6-2-2008)
12-4-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 08-06-13, 6-2-2008)
12-4-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials that are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or water of the United
States said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within two (2)
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years. (Ord. 08-06-13, 6-2-2008)
12-4-13: ENFORCEMENT:
Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
   A.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

Statutes 5/11-150-1 and on authority contained in other provisions of the state
statutes, there is established within the village a fee for connecting into the
waterworks system or sewerage system of the village. This fee is to be assessed
against new or additional users of the sewage collection and treatment system
or the water system of the village and shall be known as a connection fee. The
fee shall be payable at the time a building or connection permit is issued. The
amount of the connection fee shall be comprised of several component fees. The
basic component fee shall be a sum fixed within this section to be designated
as the water connection fee, or sewer connection fee. If the building plans do
not indicate an accurate estimate of the volume and/or strength of the usage,
the applicant shall pay an additional fee based on the most accurate estimate
which can be made upon the plans submitted. At the time that the sewer and/or
water connection is in full use, a reevaluation of the volume and/or strength
of the usage shall be made and if necessary an adjustment of the fees shall be
made. This reevaluation shall be made within one year of the date at which the
operation, in the opinion of the superintendent of the waterworks and sewerage
system, shall have reached its full use.
   B.   Water Connection Fee: The connection fee shall be twenty dollars
($20.00) per population equivalent plus an additional fee determined by adding
together the basic component fees which are applicable to each new or
additional user of the system, the sum of which shall constitute the total
connection fee. The several component fees are established as follows:
      1.   Fee According To Size Of Tap: The water connection fee shall be
based on the size of the water tap. This fee shall reimburse the village for a
portion of the waterworks system previously constructed by the village which
