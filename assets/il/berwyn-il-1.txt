investigations and to require additional information and documents from persons
who may have violated the provisions of this chapter;
      (4)   To compel the attendance of witnesses and to compel the production

place of the meeting to determine the sufficiency of the complaint and to
establish whether probable cause exists to proceed.
      (3)   (a)   Upon not less than 48 hours’ public notice, the Commission
shall meet to review the sufficiency of the complaint and, if the complaint is
deemed sufficient to allege a violation of this chapter, to determine whether
there is probable cause, based on the evidence presented by the complainant, to
proceed. The meeting may be closed to the public to the extent authorized by
the Open Meetings Act, being ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, § 1. The Commission shall

on the sufficiency of the complaint and, if necessary, on probable cause to

209.03 and there is a determination of probable cause, then the Commission’s
notice to the parties shall include a hearing date scheduled within four weeks
after the complaint’s receipt. Alternatively, the Commission may elect to
notify in writing the attorney designated by the corporate authorities to
prosecute actions and request that the complaint be adjudicated judicially. If
the complaint is deemed not sufficient to allege a violation or if there is no
determination of probable cause, then the Commission shall send by certified
mail, return receipt requested, a notice to the parties of the decision to
dismiss the complaint, and that notice shall be made public.
         (c)   If the complaint is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of §
209.02, then the Commission shall notify in writing the attorney designated by
the corporate authorities to prosecute actions and shall transmit to the
attorney the complaint and all additional documents in the custody of the
Commission concerning the alleged violation.
      (4)   On the scheduled date and upon at least 48 hours’ public notice of
the meeting, the Commission shall conduct a hearing on the complaint and shall
allow both parties the opportunity to present testimony and evidence. The
hearing may be closed to the public only if authorized by the Open Meetings
Act.
      (5)   Within 30 days after the date the hearing or any recessed hearing
is concluded, the Commission shall either dismiss the complaint; or issue a
recommendation for discipline to the alleged violator and to the Mayor or other
officer having authority to discipline the officer or employee, or impose a
fine upon the violator, or both. The particular findings in the case, any
recommendation for discipline, and any fine imposed shall be a matter of public
information.
      (6)   If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file a
written demand for a public hearing on the complaint within seven business days
after the issuance of the recommendation for discipline or imposition of a
fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the enforcement of the
recommendation or fine. Within 14 days after receiving the demand, the
Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon at least 48
hours’ public notice of the hearing and allow both parties the opportunity to
present testimony and evidence. Within seven days thereafter, the Commission
shall publicly issue a final recommendation to the alleged violator and to the
Mayor or other officer having authority to discipline the officer or employee
or impose a fine upon the violator or both.
      (7)   If a complaint is filed during the 60 days preceding the date of
any election at which the respondent is a candidate, the Commission shall
render its decision as required under division (E)(5) of this section within
seven days after the complaint is filed, and during the seven days preceding

ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, § 1. The verbatim record shall be in the form of an audio
or video recording as determined by the corporate authorities.
   (B)   Responsibility for recording closed sessions and maintaining
recordings. The City Clerk or his or her designee shall be responsible for
arranging for the recording of closed or executive sessions. In the absence of
the City Clerk or his or her designee, the meeting Chair will arrange for the
audio or video recording of the closed or executive session of the City
Council. Each subsidiary public body of the city shall designate an individual
who will be responsible for the recording of any and all closed or executive
sessions of the subsidiary body and for providing the City Clerk with a copy of
the recording. The City Clerk, or his or her designee, shall securely maintain
the verbatim recordings of all closed sessions of the corporate authorities of
the city and all subsidiary public bodies of the city.
   (C)   Closed session minutes. In addition to the recordings of the closed
and executive session as addressed in this section, the city will keep minutes
of all closed meetings in accordance with the requirements of the Open Meetings
Act, ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, § 1.
   (D)   Procedure for recording. At the beginning of each closed session,

and identify themselves by voice at the beginning of the closed session. The

   (E)   Back-up equipment/procedure for equipment malfunction. The city will
maintain sufficient tapes, batteries and equipment for the city to comply with
this section. The City Clerk or his or her designee will periodically check the
equipment to confirm that it is functioning. In the event that anyone present
at a closed session determines that the equipment is not functioning properly,
the closed session will be temporarily suspended to attempt to correct the
malfunction. In the event that an equipment malfunction cannot be corrected
immediately, the closed session will terminate until a time as the closed
session may proceed with a functioning recording device.
   (F)   Procedure for review of closed session minutes and recordings. At one
meeting at least every six months, the agenda shall include the item: “Review
of the minutes and recordings of all closed sessions that have not yet been
released for public review and determination of which minutes, if any, may be
released.” Minutes shall be reviewed in closed session and shall not be
released unless the corporate authorities of the city find that it is no longer
necessary to protect the public interest or the privacy of an individual by
keeping them confidential. As to any minutes not released, the corporate
authorities shall find that the “need for confidentiality still exists” as to
those minutes. Minutes of closed sessions shall be kept indefinitely.
Recordings shall be reviewed in a manner appropriate to the purpose for which
they were intended.
   (G)   Maintenance and public release of recordings and access to tapes. The
audio or video tape recordings of closed sessions shall be maintained for 18
months after the closed session and shall not be released to the public unless
the release is required by a court order or specifically authorized for release
by a vote of the City Council. Members of the corporate authorities may listen
to the closed session recordings in the presence of the City Clerk or his or
her designee. Copies of the tapes will not be made or provided to anyone unless
specifically authorized by vote of the City Council.

designee is hereby authorized to destroy the audio and video recordings of
those closed sessions for which:

the closed sessions as to accurate content, regardless of whether the minutes
have been released for public review;

session;
      (3)   There is no court order requiring the preservation of the
recording; and

call between the absent Council member and the rest of the Council present at
the regular meeting under the following conditions:
      (1)   The absent Council member cannot be physically present at the

security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city and conforming
to all state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
   (B)   Scope. This policy shall include all funds governed by the City
Council, and its procedure is applicable to the Director of Finance in making
investment decisions and managing the cash flow of funds.
   (C)   Prudence. Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, that persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. The standard of prudence
to be used by investment officials shall be the “prudent person” standard in
the context of managing an overall portfolio.
   (D)   Objectives.
      (1)   The primary objectives, in order of priority, shall be:
         (a)   Legality. Conformance with federal, state and other legal
requirements;

investment principal;
         (c)   Safety. Preservation of capital and protection of investment
principal;
         (d)   Liquidity. Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements;
         (e)   Yield. Attainment of market rates of return; and
         (f)   Support of local financial institutions. The city is committed
to support its local financial institutions and will, whenever practical, place
its investments with these local businesses. The concept is that retention of
funds in the city could fund economic growth and enhance the tax base.
      (2)   The portfolio shall be reviewed periodically as to its
effectiveness in meeting the city’s needs for safety, liquidity, rate of
return, diversification and its general performance.
   (E)   Delegation of authority. Management and administrative responsibility
for the investment program is hereby delegated to the Director of Finance, who,
under the direction of the Mayor and the City Council, shall establish written
procedures for the operation of the investment program.
   (F)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions.
   (G)   Authorized financial dealers and institutions. The Director of Finance
will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment
services. Additionally, a list will also be maintained of approved security
broker/dealers selected by credit worthiness.
   (H)   Authorized and suitable investments. Investments may be made in any
type of security allowed by law as set out in the Illinois Compiled Statutes
regarding the investment of public funds. All investments shall be made that
reflect the cash flow needs of the fund type being invested.

of deposit and the like) in excess of FDIC limits must be secured by some form
of collateral, witnessed by a written agreement, and held at an independent
third-party institution in the name of the city.
   (J)   Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including
collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the city shall be
conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by
an independent third-party custodian designated by the Director of Finance and
evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written custodial agreement.
   (K)   Diversification. The city shall diversify its investments to the best
of its ability based on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of
those funds. Diversification can be by the type of investment, number of
institutions invested in, and the length of maturity. The city shall diversify
its investments to avoid incurring unreasonable risks regarding specific
security types and/or individual financial institutions.
   (L)   Maximum maturities.
      (1)   To the extent possible, the city shall attempt to match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to specific
cash flow, the city will not directly invest in securities maturing more than
two years from the date of purchase.
      (2)   Reserve funds may be invested in securities exceeding two years if
the maturity of investments is made to coincide as nearly as practicable with
the expected use of the funds.
   (M)   Internal control. The Director of Finance is responsible for
establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to insure
that the assets of the city are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The
internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance
that these objectives are met. The internal controls shall address the
following points:
      (1)   Control of collusion;
      (2)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting;
      (3)   Custodial safekeeping; and
      (4)   Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and
wire transfers.
   (N)   Performance standards. The investment portfolio will be managed in
accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio
should obtain a comparable rate of return during a market/economic environment
of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared to
benchmarks with similar maturity, liquidity and credit quality as the
portfolio.
   (O)   Reporting. The Director of Finance shall prepare an investment report
on a monthly basis. This report will be provided to the Mayor and the City
Council and shall be available upon request. The report should be in a format
suitable for review by the general public.
   (P)   Quarterly statement. A statement of the market value of the portfolio
shall be issued to the Mayor and the City Council quarterly.
   (Q)   Adoption of policy; annual review. This investment policy shall be
adopted by the Mayor and City Council. This policy shall be reviewed on an
annual basis by the Director of Finance and any modifications made hereto shall
be approved by the Mayor and City Council. Any investment purchased before the
date of the implementation of this policy that is not within the parameters of
this policy will be held to maturity or to the time that it is deemed
appropriate to sell the investment.

corporation or political subdivisions of the state or federal government in the
exercise of emergency powers as provided by law.
   (B)   In the event of a local disaster declaration under §
240.07, or in the implementation of any negotiated recommended mutual aid
agreement under §
240.05, the Agency shall cooperate fully with any assisting municipal
corporation or political subdivisions of the state or federal government.

§ 240.09 PURCHASES AND EXPENDITURES.
   (A)   Funds to prepare for and meet disasters may be made available as from
time to time designated by the City Council within budgetary limits.
   (B)   It is the City Council’s intent that the first recourse shall be to
funds regularly allocated to the Agency. If the Mayor finds that demands placed
upon budgeted funds in coping with a particular disaster are unreasonably
great, he or she may make application for funds from the state or federal
government levels. If monies available from the state or federal government
levels are insufficient, and if the Mayor finds that other sources of money to
cope with the disaster are not available or are insufficient, he or she shall
issue a call for an immediate session of the City Council for the purpose of
enacting ordinances as the Council may deem necessary to transfer and expend
monies appropriated for other purposes, or borrow monies from the United States
government or other public or private sources. If less than a quorum of the
members of the Council is capable of convening in session to enact ordinances
for the transfer, expenditure or loan of monies, the Mayor is authorized to
carry out these decisions until a time as a quorum of the Council can convene.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the
Mayor’s authority to apply for, administer and expend grants, gifts or payments
in aid of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.
   (D)   The City Council may enter into contracts and incur obligations
necessary to place it in a position to effectively combat disaster emergencies,
to protect the health and safety of persons, to protect property, and to
provide emergency assistance to victims of those disasters. If a disaster
occurs, the Agency may exercise the powers vested under this chapter in light
of the exigencies of the disaster and, excepting mandatory constitutional
requirements, without regard to the procedures and formalities normally
prescribed by law pertaining to the performance of public work, entering into
contracts, the incurring of obligations, the employment of temporary workers,
the rental of equipment, the purchase of supplies and materials, and the
appropriation, expenditure and disposition of public funds and property.
   (E)   The City Council may make appropriations for emergency management
operations in the manner provided by law for making appropriations for the
ordinary expenses of the city.

§ 240.10 OATH OF MEMBERS.
   Each person appointed to serve in any capacity in the Agency shall, before
entering upon his or her duties, subscribe to the following oath, in writing,
which shall be filed with the Director:
I, ___________, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend
and bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and
the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and the territory, institutions and
facilities thereof, both public and private, against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or
purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties
upon which I am about to enter. And I do further swear (or affirm) that I do
not advocate, nor am I nor have I been a member of any political party or
organization that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United
States or of this state by force or violence; and that during the time as I am
affiliated with the Berwyn Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, I
will not advocate nor become a member of any political party or organization
that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States or of this
state by force or violence.

§ 240.11 OFFICE SPACE.
   The Mayor is authorized to designate space in a city building, or elsewhere,
as may be provided for by the Mayor, for the Agency as its office.
(Ord. 08-67, passed 10-14-2008)
§ 240.12 IMMUNITY.
   Neither the city, nor the Mayor, the Director, or the officers, employees,
volunteers or representatives engaged in any emergency management response or
recovery activities, while complying with or attempting to comply with this
chapter or any rule or regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter is
liable for the death of or any injury to persons, or damage to property, as a
result of that activity. This section does not, however, affect the right of
any person to receive benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled
under this chapter under the Workers’ Compensation Act, being ILCS Ch. 820, Act
305, §§ 1 et seq., or the Workers’ Occupational Diseases Act, being ILCS Ch.
820, Act 310, §§ 1 et seq., or under any pension law, and this section does not
affect the right of any person to receive any benefits or compensation under
any Act of Congress.

(Ord. 94-09, passed 2-22-1994; Ord. 20-03, passed 1-28-2020)
§ 242.13 ALCOHOL/DRUG TESTING POLICY AND PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Policy. The use of unauthorized controlled substances by employees
poses a significant danger to the health, safety and welfare of the employee
and public. It undermines the public trust, adversely affects productivity, and
is therefore prohibited. This policy includes post accident/incident testing
provided that reasonable suspicion exists and is established. To the extent
that this policy does not conflict with union contracts, this policy shall be
administered for all city employees. This policy establishes “zero tolerance”
of any level of alcohol or controlled substances. ZERO TOLERANCE specifically
means that no level of alcohol or controlled substances is accepted for any
employee of the city while on duty.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to establish written procedures
for conducting urinalysis/toxicology tests of all employees under the following
conditions:
      (1)   When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the
influence of alcohol or is using an unauthorized controlled substance while on
duty;
      (2)   Post-accident testing; and
      (3)   Random alcohol/drug testing for all employees.
   (C)   Responsibility. 
      (1)   All department heads, supervisors and managers are responsible for
the implementation of this policy.
       (2)   The city is responsible for obtaining and approving the laboratory
testing facility and testing procedures.
      (3)   The fee for testing employees shall be paid for by the city.
   (D)   Employment testing; reasonable suspicion.
      (1)   Reasonable suspicion exists if specific objective facts and
circumstances warrant rational inferences that a person may be under the
influence of alcohol or a banned substance. Illustrative, but not all
inclusive, criteria of reasonable suspicion are:
         (a)   A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior; a dramatic
decline in work performance; excessive sick leave usage;
         (b)   Information provided by a reliable and credible source which is
independently corroborated by supervisory staff;
         (c)   Difficulty walking, slurred speech, needle marks, glazed stare;
         (d)   Observation, such as direct observation of use and/or physical
symptoms of being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance; and
         (e)   Possession of alcohol or a controlled substance while on duty or
while on city property.
      (2)   If an employee believes that there is reasonable suspicion that
another employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance,
that employee should report his or her suspicion to his or her immediate
supervisor.
      (3)   If the supervisor believes that there is reasonable suspicion that
an employee in under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, he or
she must confirm his or her suspicion with the department head. If those
suspicions are confirmed, the suspected employee will be immediately notified
that a blood or urine sample will be required. The following procedures will be
immediately taken:
         (a)   The employee shall sign a release and consent authorization form
for the alcohol/drug testing information to be released to the city;
         (b)   The employee’s refusal to take the alcohol/drug test shall be
treated the same as a positive test result. If an employee leaves the premises
after being advised by his or her supervisor of the above, it shall be
considered “insubordination,” and as if the employee had refused to submit to
the test, which is a violation of this policy. The violation shall be
considered “just cause” and treated in the same manner as a positive test
result;
         (c)   Chain-of-custody documentation for the specimen shall be
maintained by the doctor, collection facility and/or laboratory from collection
to analysis to destruction. A copy of the results shall be forwarded to the
city;
         (d)   The employee will be escorted by the supervisor to a designated
collection facility or laboratory where a urine/blood sample will be taken by a
medical professional. The test results shall be submitted to the city where
they shall remain as confidential;
         (e)   Upon completion of the tests, the employee shall be transported
to his or her residence. Under no circumstances shall an employee suspected of
being under the influence of alcohol or using drugs be allowed to leave the
work site or the test site driving his or her own or a city owned vehicle. If
there is reason to believe that a medical or safety issue might exist at the
time of employee testing, the employee will be evaluated by a physician at the
testing facility for medical clearance to return to his or her residence; and
         (f)   The employee shall remain on paid status until the results are
received. If the test is positive, the employee will be notified and will be
given the opportunity to present information that the positive result was the
result of an over-the-counter or prescribed drug, or that special circumstances
may have affected the test results.
   (E)   Employment testing; random testing. Random alcohol/drug testing shall
be performed for all city employees. Testing dates and times will be
unannounced and with unpredictable frequency throughout the calendar year. All
testing will be done in the same manner as previously outlined in this policy.
All employees will be issued a written explanation of the rules and procedures
to be followed to accomplish random test requirements.
   (F)   Post-accident testing.  
      (1)   Post-accident drug/alcohol testing for any employee operating a
city owned vehicle is required when:
         (a)   A fatality occurs; and
         (b)   Any time the driver receives a citation under state or local
laws and personal injury is involved or the vehicle must be towed from the
scene.
      (2)   Testing must be done as soon as possible after the accident.
Testing for alcohol must be done within two hours and for drugs within 32 hours
after the accident.
      (3)   “Reasonable suspicion” may also be applicable as cause for post-
accident testing. In addition to affecting those employees who drive commercial
vehicles, any employee who utilizes a city vehicle may be subject to post-
accident testing.
   (G)   Payment for testing.
      (1)   The city will assume all costs for testing outlined in this policy.
      (2)   If an employee tests positive for alcohol or any controlled
substance, he or she will be terminated from his or her employment with the
city or given the opportunity to resign.
   (H)   Test results.  
      (1)   All test results and related documentation will be treated
confidentially and shall not be utilized by the city for any purpose other than
employment matters.
      (2)   Test results shall not be released to any other agency or to
prospective employers of the employee without the written consent of the
employee. Test results shall not be released to any law enforcement agency,
except pursuant to a lawful subpoena or court order.
   (I)   Disciplinary action for positive test results.
       (1)   A positive test result for either alcohol or a controlled
substance will result in the employee’s immediate termination, or the city may
accept the employee’s resignation. The action described herein is not mutually
exclusive of any other action that another agency may take.
      (2)   Any violation of this policy is considered “just cause” for
termination.
      (3)   An employee showing a positive test result of any kind for
controlled substances, while on duty, shall be given the opportunity to either
resign or be terminated.
       (4)   An employee showing a positive test result of any kind for
alcohol, while on duty, shall be given the opportunity to either resign or be
terminated.
      (5)   An employee’s first offense for a positive reading for controlled
substances or alcohol will result in immediate termination of employment, or
the city will accept the employee’s resignation.
   (J)   Employee assistance.
      (1)   The city fully supports all assistance programs that are available
and encourages employees who have alcohol and/or drug problems to seek these
confidential services. These services play an important role by providing
employees an opportunity to eliminate alcohol and drug use. These treatment
centers will follow up with individuals during their rehabilitation and track
their progress and encourage successful completion of the program.
      (2)   Admittance to an assistance program is not a substitute for work
rule violations.
(Ord. 99-50, passed 10-26-1999)
§ 242.14 FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN HIRING AND PROMOTION.
   (A)   After February 8, 2000, no person shall be hired and placed in any
position of employment within the city which would cause the person to report
to a supervisor with whom the person has a familial relationship.
   (B)   A FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIP shall be defined as a relationship between two
persons where at least one of them is a mother, father, sister, brother,

   (D)   As of February 8, 2000, no person shall be considered for hiring or
for promotion unless and until he or she completely and accurately fills out
and submits to the city an affidavit disclosing all persons employed by the
city with whom he or she has a familial relationship. Any affidavit found to be
false or misleading shall constitute grounds for termination of the person who
submitted false or misleading affidavit.
   (E)   No person shall participate in any decision to hire if that person has
a familial relationship with the person being considered for hiring.
   (F)   No person shall participate in any decision to promote if that person
has a familial relationship with the person being considered for promotion.
   (G)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person whose

Fire Department in effect on February 8, 2000.
   (H)   All means not in conflict with state or federal law or with any
current collective bargaining agreement previously entered into by the city
shall be utilized to implement and enforce this section.
(Ord. 00-06, passed 2-8-2000)
§ 242.15 EMPLOYEE LEGAL COUNSEL AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   Purpose. This section is designed to protect the interests of elected
and appointed officials, officers and employees of the city where they become
involved in civil proceedings arising out of the performance or exercise of
their official duties.
   (B)   Legal indemnification program. The city hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify all of its elected and appointed officials, officers and employees to
the extent that liability is assessed against the persons which is not covered
by conventional insurance coverages; provided, however, that the coverage or
indemnification hereunder does not include acts done by persons which are
criminal in nature, outside the scope of their employment or willful or wanton
direct violations of laws, statues, ordinances or regulations and for which the
city would otherwise be responsible because of the doctrine of respondeat
superior.
   (C)   Defense. The city hereby agrees to provide a defense at its expense to
any of its elected and appointed officials, officers and employees covered
under division (B) herein. The duty to defend shall extend to all cross claims

   (D)   Indemnification.  The city hereby agrees to indemnify and save and
hold harmless any of its elected and appointed officials, officers and

   (E)   Representation. Whenever the city provides for the defense of any
action set forth herein and as a condition of the defense, the city may assume
exclusive control over the representation of the persons defended and the
person shall cooperate fully with the city. The city may provide for the
defense pursuant to this section by authorizing its attorney to act in behalf
of the person being defended unless the City Council determines there is
potential for a conflict of interest between the persons and city officials who
would normally exercise control over the representation of the persons. Outside
counsel shall be employed in the event that a potential conflict of interest is
determined. The determination of the city and the City Council that there is no
potential conflict of interest is subject to review by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

§ 242.16 DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY.
   (A)   Statement of policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the City that all employees engage in the
highest possible professional standards and that all persons be treated fairly,
civilly and with respect. To this end, the City will not tolerate or condone
discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
gender, gender-identity, gender-expression, sexual orientation, genetic
information, national origin, age, physical or menial disability, pregnancy,
childbirth (or common conditions related thereto) ancestry, marital status,
military status, arrest record, unfavorable discharge from military service,
order of protection status, citizenship status, or any other classification
prohibited under federal or state law. Sexual misconduct is also prohibited.
      (2)   The City will neither tolerate nor condone discrimination,
harassment or sexual misconduct by employees, managers, supervisors, elected
officials, co-workers, or non-employees with whom the City has a business,
service, or professional relationship. EMPLOYEE for purposes of this policy
includes any individual performing services for the City, a contractor, a
consultant, an apprentice, an applicant for apprenticeship, an unpaid intern or
volunteers. Retaliation against an employee who complains about or reports any
act of discrimination, harassment or misconduct in violation of this policy is
prohibited. Retaliation against any employee who participates in an
investigation pursuant to this policy is likewise prohibited. The City is
committed to ensuring and providing a workplace free of discrimination,
harassment, sexual misconduct and retaliation. The City will take disciplinary
action, up to and including termination, against an employee who violates this
policy.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment. This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently
defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation.
   (C)   Responsibilities.
      (1)   Supervisors. Each supervisor shall be responsible for ensuring
compliance with this policy, including the following:
         (a)   Monitoring the workplace environment for signs of
discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct;
         (b)   Immediately notifying law enforcement where there is reasonable
belief that the observed or complained of conduct violates the criminal laws of
the State of Illinois;
         (c)   Immediately addressing any observed acts of discrimination,
harassment or sexual misconduct and taking steps to intervene when appropriate,
whether or not the involved employees are within their line of supervision;
         (d)   Immediately reporting any complaint of harassment,
discrimination or sexual misconduct to their department head; and
         (e)   Take immediate action to limit the work contact between the
individuals when there has been a complaint of discrimination, harassment or
sexual misconduct, pending investigation.
      (2)   Employees. Each employee is responsible for assisting in the
prevention of discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct through the
following acts:
         (a)   Refrain from participation in, or encouragement of, actions that
could be perceived as discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct.
         (b)   Immediately reporting any violations of this policy to a
supervisor and law enforcement (if appropriate under the circumstances).
Employees are obligated to report violations of this policy as soon as they
occur. An employee should not wait until the conduct becomes unbearable before
reporting the prohibited conduct. All employees are obligated to report
instances of prohibited conduct, even if the conduct is merely observed and
directed toward another individual, and even if the other person does not
appear to be bothered or offended by the conduct. All employees are obligated
to report instances of prohibited conduct regardless of the identity of the
alleged offender (e.g. man, woman, supervisor, elected official, co-worker,
volunteer, vendor, and/or member of the public.)
         (c)   Encouraging any employee who confides that they are the victim
of conduct in violation of this policy to report these acts to a supervisor.
   Failure to report known discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct may
be grounds for discipline.
   (D)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
themselves to be the object of sexual harassment should, if they feel safe
doing so, deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by
clearly communicating their position to the offending employee and their
immediate supervisor. If the employee is a union member, it may be reported to
their union representative as well. It is not necessary for sexual harassment
to be directed at the person making the report. The employee experiencing what
they believe to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware
of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a
supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed
to have knowledge of the harassment.
      (2)   Any employee may report conduct, which is believed to be sexual
harassment, in any of the following ways:
         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should, if they feel safe
doing so, directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is
unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may
be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in
a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report (unless that person is the
harasser/offender) and/or to any of the following: a department head, the city
administrator, or the Mayor.
         (c)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is
to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can he identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was
said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   Supervisors shall immediately report any conduct that may violate this
policy of which they become aware of to their department head who will in turn
report to the Mayor. The Mayor will advise the City Council of all such
complaints.
   (E)   Reporting and independent review of an allegation of sexual harassment
for elected officials.
      (1)   An elected official who either observes another elected official
engage in sexual harassment or believes themselves to be the object of sexual
harassment by another elected official may report such conduct for independent
review to the City Attorney. If the City Attorney believes a conflict exists
which prevents her or him from conducting an independent review, the City
Attorney must notify the City of such conflict. Upon receiving notification of
the conflict, the City Council shall authorize the engagement of outside legal
counsel to conduct the review.
      (2)   The City Attorney or outside legal counsel shall conduct an
independent review of the allegations and provide any findings to the corporate
authorities of the City. Any documents, communications or other records created
pursuant to the review shall remain confidential, subject to attorney-client
privilege, and will not be disclosed unless such disclosure is authorized by
resolution with the concurrence of a majority of all members then holding
office on the City Council, including the Mayor, or as otherwise required by
applicable local, state or federal law.
      (3)   Such records shall also be presumed as exempt from disclosure under
the Freedom of Information Act, to the extent it is applicable.
   (F)   Investigation procedures.
      (1)   All reported violations of this policy will be investigated. The
investigation will be conducted thoroughly and promptly. It may include
interviews with the person making the complaint; the person against whom the
complaint is made, any potential witnesses identified by either person, as well
as with others whom the City believes may have relevant information. Employees
are expected to cooperate in this process. The investigation may also include
review of pertinent documents and other materials. In most circumstances, the
person making the complaint will be requested to put their complaint in
writing, honestly setting forth full particulars (such as the date, time,
location, presence of any witnesses, etc.) to ensure that all possible
violations of this policy are properly investigated.
      (2)   The investigation will be conducted in a manner that protects the
confidentiality of those involved to the extent reasonably possible. Employees
involved in an investigation may be instructed to or instructed not to discuss
the investigation with other employees depending upon the specific
circumstances of the investigation. The City will use the criteria set forth in
rulings of the National Labor Relations Board in making these determinations.
      (3)   This complaint procedure is a critical part of the City's efforts
to eliminate unlawful workplace harassment. A request not to investigate a
reported violation of this policy cannot be honored.
      (4)   The results of the investigation shall be reported to the Mayor and
the City Council along with a prevention analysis.
   (G)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
      (1)   No municipal official, supervisor or employee or any municipal
agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee due to a municipal employee's or any other person/resident's:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other slate
employee, or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it
is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because they have opposed that which
they reasonably and in good faith believe to be sexual harassment in
employment, because they have made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - due within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
   (H)   Consequences of a violation or the prohibition on discrimination,
harassment or sexual misconduct.
      (1)   Where harassment, discrimination or sexual misconduct has been
found to have occurred, the City will lake is prompt and proportionate
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, based on the behavior(s) at
issue and the severity of the infraction. This disciplinary action may, but
need not necessarily, include:
         (a)   Verbal or written reprimand;
         (b)   Placing the offending employee on a corrective action plan for a
period of time to be identified;
         (c)   Delay in pay increases or promotions;
         (d)   Suspending the offending employee from work without pay;
         (e)   Demotion; or
         (f)   Immediate termination.
      (2)   In addition to any and all other disciplinary action that may be
taken by the City, any person who violates this policy or the prohibition on
sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up
to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality
and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance,
state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a state or federal agency.
      (3)   Upon completion of the investigation, the City will advise the
complaining employee of the results of the investigation, including action
taken, if any, against the offending individual.
   (I)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of discrimination, harassment or sexual
misconduct made by an accuser using the report to accomplish some end other
than stopping the discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct. A false
report is a report not made in good faith, which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
state's attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

policies on this matter, please see your supervisor or the City Attorney.

   (B)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal
is taken certifies to the Commission, after the notice of appeal has been filed
with him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining

   (B)   Matters referred to Commission. The Commission shall also hear and
decide all matters referred to it upon which it is required to pass under the
Zoning Code.
   (C)   Power to reverse or affirm. The Commission may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify or amend, the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, which does not involve a variation, conditional
use or zoning change, without approval of Council, to the extent and in the
manner that the Commission may decide to be fitting and proper in the premises,
and to that end the Commission shall also have the powers of the Officer from
whom the appeal is taken, provided that in any case which involves the
interpretation of the Zoning Code, the designated city official, or any other
officer of the city from whom the appeal is taken, or the Executive Secretary
and/or the Chairperson of the Commission, shall request a letter of opinion
from the City Attorney regarding the matter before the Commission, and the
Commission will consider that letter as part of the evidence in making a final

proposed variation to this Zoning Code and/or a zoning change, the Executive
Secretary shall prepare and forward a resolution on that matter, and if the
Commission members vote in favor of the applicant then the Executive Secretary
shall also prepare and forward a proposed ordinance on that matter to the City
Clerk for final consideration by Council. The concurring vote of four members
of the Commission is necessary to either reverse or affirm an order,
requirement, decision or determination of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken, or to decide in favor of or against the applicant on any matter upon
which it is authorized by the Zoning Code to render a decision. In the event
that four votes cannot be obtained either in favor of or against any matter
before the Commission, requiring the final consideration of Council, and there
is a quorum present (at least four members of the Commission), the Executive
Secretary shall forward the resolution and proposed ordinance to the City Clerk
for presentation to Council without any specific recommendation from the
Commission, the members of Council may give what weight they feel is
appropriate to the facts presented in the resolution and the vote taken by the
Commission to reach a final decision.

are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      (3)   The purpose of the variation is not based primarily upon a desire
to increase financial gain;
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the Zoning Code and
has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property;
      (5)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      (6)   The granting of the variation will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhoods; and
      (7)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, impair natural drainage, create
drainage problems on adjacent properties, endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
   (G)   Time limits. No ordinance granting a variation from the Zoning Code
shall be valid longer than six months after its enactment, unless a building
permit is obtained within the period and the erection or alteration of the
building is started and completed in accordance with the terms of the ordinance
and the building permit.

on which real estate taxes or special assessments for which a bill was issued

of liability for the violation in question; and
      (3)   One excusable failure to appear at the hearing, or one request for

   (C)   Should the determination of liability be set aside, the Ordinance
Enforcement Administrator shall notify the person receiving the notice of
ordinance violation, or the registered owner, operator or lessee of the cited
vehicle, as the case may be, that the determination of liability has been set
aside. He or she shall also notify the person of the date, time and place for a
hearing on the merits. The notice shall be by first class mail, postage
prepaid, to the address set forth on the petition to set aside the
determination of liability, and shall be complete on the date the notice is
deposited in the United States mail.

the Ordinance Enforcement Administrator to be liable for vehicular standing
and/or parking regulation violations, for which the fines or penalties assessed
are in the amount of $250 or more and remain unpaid, may be immobilized, booted
or towed and impounded if:
   (A)   A seizure notice has been sent to the registered owner or lessee of
the motor vehicle, located within the geographical boundaries of the city,

impoundment if the fines and penalties are not paid within 15 days of the date
of the notice;
      (4)   The date of impending towing and impoundment; and
      (5)   A statement that the registered owner or lessee may contest the
validity of the notice by appearing in person before the Ordinance Enforcement
Administrator within 15 days of the date of the notice and submitting evidence
which would conclusively disprove liability, such as the following:
         (a)   The registered owner or lessee was not the owner or lessee of
the vehicle on the date or dates the notices of violation were issued;
         (b)   The fines or penalties for the violations cited in the notice
were paid in full; or

liability, before the Ordinance Enforcement Administrator to contest the
validity of the notice.

damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage
to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, §§ 16-
1 and 21-1.
   (B)   The notice also shall provide the following information, specifying
that a release of the immobilizing restraint may be had by:

complaints for which a notice has been sent prior to the date of the
immobilization; or
      (2)   Completing appearance forms on all outstanding parking violation

(Ord. 96-07, passed 2-13-1996)
§ 424.12 TOWING AND IMPOUNDING OF IMMOBILIZED VEHICLES.
   Except where a vehicle is otherwise subject to towing, if an immobilizing
restraint has not been released as hereinabove provided, within 72 hours of its

(Ord. 96-07, passed 2-13-1996)
§ 424.13 POST-IMPOUNDMENT NOTICE.
   Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded, notice of impoundment
shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered
owner of the vehicle. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to a

§ 424.14 POST-IMPOUNDMENT HEARING.
   The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other interested person shall have
the right to a hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any
subsequent towing of the vehicle was erroneous or whether the vehicle was
properly included on an immobilization list, if the owner files a written
demand for a hearing before the Ordinance Enforcement Administrator within 14
days after issuance of the notice specified in §
424.13 or within 14 days of immobilization, whichever is later. A hearing shall
be conducted on any business day within 48 hours of receipt of a written demand
for a hearing, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Failure to
request or attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
a hearing. In the event of failure, any amount deposited pursuant to §
424.11 shall be forfeited. A hearing provided by this section shall not
determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of

control device or turn on red in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-306.
All violations must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer of

(Ord. 10-88, passed 12-28-2010)
§ 425.03 DEFENSES.
   (A)   The following may be considered defenses by the Hearing Officer for a
violation of §
425.02:
      (1)   That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of or in
the possession of the owner at the time of the violation; or

   (A)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor
vehicle entering an intersection in violation of §
425.02, the city shall issue a written notice of violation to the registered
owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S. mail within 30
days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the city of the identity of
the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than 90
days following the violation. The city shall only be required to notify a
lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an affidavit
and a copy of the lease within 60 days of the notice's issuance. If the driver
information is not provided within 60 days, the leasing company/lessor may be
found liable. If any notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a
second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded in a United
States Post Office approved database of the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class mail postage prepaid.
   (B)   A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law
violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the
Traffic Compliance Administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine
whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of §
425.02, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in §
425.03 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the
recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of
violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner
provided for above. The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall retain a copy of
all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the
owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the
facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a
violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall be prima
facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses
established in this chapter.
   (C)   The notice of violation shall include the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database;

should be paid (14 days from the date of issuance), if a hearing is not
requested, and a statement that the payment of the fine shall operate as a
final disposition of the violation;
      (8)   A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date
noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or
lessee;
      (9)   The amount of the late fee;
      (10)   A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will
result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension
of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle;
      (11)   A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie
evidence of a violation;
      (12)   A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the
fine or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing;
and

request a hearing by the respond-by date on the notice of violation (14 days
from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an
applicable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the
facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a
violation of § 425.02. The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of
a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in §
425.03.
   (B)   The owner's failure to appear at the hearing will result in a finding
of liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a "Findings, Decision and
Order" letter will be sent to the owner. The owner's failure to pay the amount

§ 425.06 NON-RESIDENTS.
   Where the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle is not a resident
of the city but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged violation, such
person may contest the charges using the same available defenses as stated
above, but rather than attend the administrative hearing, they may submit any
and all documentary evidence to the Traffic Compliance Administrator no later
than the hearing date, together with a written statement reflecting that they

following failure to pay the fine or penalty, or to contest the alleged
violation within 14 days of the notice of violation. Where a person fails to
appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner
specified in a prior mailed notice, the Hearing Officer will enter findings,
decision and order's determination of automated traffic law violation liability
which shall become final: upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that
determination; or upon expiration of the period for filing such a petition
without a filing having been made. If a person appears at a hearing and is

have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment or may result in the suspension of
the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines or penalties for five or
more violation under this chapter.
(Ord. 10-88, passed 12-28-2010)

§ 425.12 DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION.
   (A)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator, by certified report, shall
request that the Secretary of State suspend the driving privileges of an owner
of a registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing
as a result of five automated traffic violations. The report shall be certified
and contain the following:
      (1)   The name, last known address as recorded with the Secretary of
State, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or
as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent
under this chapter is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of
the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number of
any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;

   (C)   Any person receiving notice from the Secretary of State that their
driving privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period may
challenge the accuracy of the certified report prepared by the Traffic
Compliance Administrator. The person shall, within seven days after having
received notice from the Secretary of State, request an opportunity to speak
with the Traffic Compliance Administrator to challenge the accuracy of the
certified report. If the Traffic Compliance Administrator determines that the
original report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the
report was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has
already paid their fine for the five or more automated traffic violations, the
Traffic Compliance Administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary of
State of such error in a subsequent certified report.
(Ord. 10-88, passed 12-28-2010)

right to appear and contest the violation at an administrative hearing.

      (9)   Any motor vehicle that contains an unregistered firearm or a
firearm that is not broken down in a non-functioning state, except that (a) if
the vehicle is operating as a common carrier and the violation occurs without
the knowledge of the person in control of the vehicle or (b) if the owner
proves that the presence of the firearm was permissible pursuant to the
provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
      (10)   Any motor vehicle being used in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5,
§ 3-801 and § 3-413 of the Illinois Vehicle Code for a period in excess of six
months regarding no registration of a motor vehicle, ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-
401 for no valid registration, or ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-702 and § 3-708 for

      (14)   Any motor vehicle which is being used to engage in street racing
or drifting.
   (C)   Seizure and impoundment.
      (1)   Whenever a police officer has a reason to believe that a vehicle is
subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer
shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility approved by the Chief
of Police. This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation
was stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police
authorities within 12 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should
have been discovered.
      (2)   The police officer shall notify any person identifying himself or
herself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control
of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is a person, of
the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle owner’s right to request an
administrative hearing to be conducted under this section.
   (D)   Administrative hearing. Within five days after a vehicle is seized and
impounded pursuant to this section, the city shall notify by personal service
or by certified mail the owner of record of the owner’s right to request a
hearing to challenge whether a violation of this section has occurred. The
owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing
with the Chief of Police or his or her designee no later than ten business days
after notice was mailed. The hearing date must be scheduled no more than ten
business days after a request for a hearing has been filed. All interested
persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The
formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible. Within seven days after the hearing, if the Hearing
Officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used
in violation of this section, then the Hearing Officer shall enter an order
finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the city for the
administrative penalty of $750 per towable offense as set forth in division (B)
above. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer does not determine by a
preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in a violation, the
Hearing Officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and for the return
of the vehicle. If the owner of record requests a hearing but fails to appear
at the hearing or fails to request in a timely manner, the owner of record
shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the Hearing
Officer shall enter a default order in favor of the city in the amount of the
administrative penalty. However, if the owner of record pays the penalty and
the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default order need be entered if the
owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing and executes a written
waiver, in which case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made
when the city receives the written waiver.
   (E)   Disposition of impounded vehicle. A penalty imposed pursuant to this
section shall constitute a debt due and owing the city. A vehicle impounded
pursuant to this section shall remain impounded until:
      (1)   The penalty of $750 per towable offense as set forth in division
(B) above is paid to the city and all applicable towing fees are paid to the
towing agent, in which case the owner of record shall be given possession of
the vehicle;
      (2)   A bond in the amount of $750 is posted with the Police Department
and all applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, at which time the
vehicle will be released to the owner of record; or
      (3)   The vehicle is deemed abandoned, in which case the vehicle shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned
vehicles.
   (F)   Posting of bond. If a bond in the amount of $750 is posted with the
Police Department, the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owner of
record; the owner of the vehicle shall still be liable to the towing agent for
any applicable towing fees. If one or more $750 penalties are imposed for
violation of this section, the $750 bond will be forfeited to the city; however
if a violation of this section is not proven by a preponderance of the
evidence, the $750 bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. All
bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the city until the
Hearing Officer issues a decision, or if there is a judicial review, until the
Court issues its decision.
   (G)   Vehicle possession. Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30
days after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek
judicial review of the city’s action under this section, or the time at which a
final judgment is rendered in favor of the city at the time a final
administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in
default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law,
provided, however, that where proceedings have been instituted under state or
federal or asset forfeiture laws, the subject vehicle may not be disposed of by
the city except as consistent with those proceedings.

section fail to pay the stated fine and fail to contest the basis of the notice
either by writing or by in-person hearing, a default judgment shall be entered
against that person and that person shall be responsible for the citation
penalty of $100 plus the additional fine of $100 for failure to pay the fine

semipublic area of the city while:
         (a)   The alcohol concentration in the person’s blood or breath is

hereof;
         (b)   Under the influence of alcohol;
         (c)   Under the influence of any other drug or combination of drugs to
a degree which renders the person incapable of safely driving; or
         (d)   Under the combined influence of alcohol and any other drug or
drugs to a degree which renders the person incapable of safely driving.
      (2)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of this division
is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or any other drug, or any
combination of both, shall not constitute a defense against the charge.
      (3)   The driving privileges of any person convicted under this division
shall be subject to revocation by the Secretary of State in the same manner and
to the same extent as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 11-501 and 6-205.
   (B)   Suspension of driver’s license; implied consent.
      (1)   Any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor
vehicle upon a street, highway, shopping center, parking lot or other public or
semipublic area of the city shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to
division (C) hereof, to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath or urine for
the purpose of determining the content of alcohol, other drugs, or a
combination thereof, in the person’s blood, if arrested, as evidenced by the
issuance of a uniform traffic ticket, for a violation of division (A) hereof.
The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting
officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which
test shall be administered by their enforcement personnel.
      (2)   Any person who is dead, unconscious or otherwise in a condition
rendering him or her incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have withdrawn
the consent provided by division (B)(1) hereof and the test or tests may be
administered, subject to division (C) hereof.
      (3)   (a)   A person who is requested to submit to a test as provided in
division (B)(1) hereof shall be warned by the law enforcement officer
requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test will result in the
suspension of the person’s license to operate a motor vehicle for six months
for the first such arrest and refusal and a suspension of the privilege for 12
months for the second and each subsequent arrest and refusal within five years.
Following this warning, if a person under arrest refuses, upon the request of a
law enforcement officer, to submit to a test designated by the law enforcement
agency, as provided in division (B)(1) hereof, none shall be given, but the law
enforcement officer shall file, with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the
County, a sworn statement naming the person refusing to take and complete the
test or tests requested under this division. The sworn statement shall identify
the arrested person, shall contain the person’s driver’s license number and
current residence address and shall specify that a refusal by the person to
take the test or tests was made. The sworn statement shall include a statement
that the arresting officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person was
driving the motor vehicle within the city while under the influence of alcohol
or any other drug, or a combination thereof, that the test or tests were made
as an incident to and following the lawful arrest for a violation of division
(A) hereof and that the person, after being arrested for an offense arising out
of acts alleged to have been committed while so driving or in actual physical
control of a motor vehicle, refused to submit to and complete a test or tests
as requested by the law enforcement officer.
         (b)   The Clerk shall thereupon notify the person, in writing, that
the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be suspended unless,
within 28 days from the date of mailing of the notice, the person requests, in
writing, a hearing thereon. If the person desires a hearing, he or she shall
file a complaint in the Circuit Court of the county. The hearing shall proceed
in the Court in the same manner as other civil proceedings and shall cover only
the issues of whether or not the person was placed under arrest for a violation
of division (A) hereof, as evidenced by the issuance of a uniform traffic
ticket; whether or not the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe
that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol or any other drug, or a combination
thereof; and whether or not the person refused to submit and complete the test
or tests upon the request of the law enforcement officer. Whether or not the
person was informed that his or her privilege to drive would be suspended if he
or she refused to submit to the test or tests shall not be an issue.
Immediately upon the termination of the Court proceedings, the Clerk shall
notify the Secretary of State of the Court’s decision. The driver’s license,
the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on highways of the state given to a
nonresident, or the privilege which an unlicensed person might have to obtain a
license under the Driver’s License Act, of the arrested person, shall be
subject to suspension by the Secretary of State in the same manner and to the
same extent as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501.1 if that is the
decision of the Court. If the Court recommends that the person be given a
restricted driving permit to prevent undue hardship, the Clerk shall so report
to the Secretary of State.
      (4)   Regardless of whether or not the person files a complaint in the
Court for a Court proceeding as provided in division (B)(3) hereof, whenever a
driver’s license is suspended under this division, the Secretary of State may,
if application is made therefor by the person whose license is so suspended,
issue the person a restricted driver’s permit to prevent undue hardship, in the
same manner, under the same conditions and with the same limitations specified
in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-205. If the person has had a Court hearing, and if
the Court recommended that the person be given a restricted driver’s permit to
prevent undue hardship, this recommendation shall be made a part of the hearing
before the Secretary of State.
   (C)   Tests.
      (1)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding
arising out of an arrest for a violation of division (A) hereof, evidence of
the concentration of alcohol or any other drug, or a combination thereof, in a
person’s blood or breath at the time alleged, as determined by an analysis of
the person’s blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance, shall be
admissible. Where the test is made, the following provisions shall apply:
         (a)   Chemical analyses of the person’s blood, urine, breath or other
bodily substance to be considered valid under this division, shall have been
performed according to standards promulgated by the State Department of Public
Health in consultation with the State Department of Law Enforcement by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the State Department of Public
Health for that purpose. The Director of the State Department of Public Health,
in consultation with the State Department of Law Enforcement, is authorized to
approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and
competence of individuals to conduct the analyses, to issue permits which shall
be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of the State
Department of Public Health and to certify the accuracy of breath testing
equipment. All regulations of the State Department of Public Health that are
now or hereafter prescribed as necessary to implement ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-501.2 shall be considered regulations applicable to this division;
         (b)   When a person submits to a blood test at the request of a law
enforcement officer, under division (B) hereof, only a physician authorized to
practice medicine, a registered nurse or any other qualified person approved by
the State Department of Public Health may withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug or alcohol and drug content therein. This
limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens;
         (c)   The person tested may have a physician or a qualified
technician, chemist, registered nurse or other qualified person of his or her
own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any test
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a
law enforcement officer;
         (d)   Upon the request of the person who submits to a chemical test or
tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning
the test or tests shall be made available to the person or to his or her
attorney; and
         (e)   As used in this division, ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION means either
grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210
liters of breath.
      (2)   (a)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal proceeding arising
out of an act alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in
actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the
concentration of alcohol in the person’s blood or breath at the time alleged,
as shown by an analysis of the person’s blood, urine, breath or other bodily
substance, shall give rise to the following presumptions:
            1.   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or
less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of
alcohol;
            2.   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess
of 0.05, but less than 0.08, the facts shall not give rise to any presumption
that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but the fact may
be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether or not the
person was under the influence of alcohol; and
            3.   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or
more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
         (b)   This division (C)(2) shall not be construed as limiting the
introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the question of
whether or not the person was under the influence of alcohol.
      (3)   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under
division (B) hereof, evidence of the refusal shall be admissible in any civil
or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an act alleged to have been
committed while the person under the influence of alcohol or any other drug, or
a combination thereof, was driving or in actual physical control of a motor
vehicle.

disabilities);
      (3)   The applicant has no outstanding debts with the city;
      (4)   The person who is permanently disabled or a disabled veteran as

in violation of a sign.
      (4)   Disabled parking permits shall only be issued to one vehicle per
property and only one disabled parking permit number shall be issued per
property.
      (5)   The Director of Public Works shall develop the appropriate signage,
in compliance with this section and ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-1301 et seq.,

Clerk’s Office, Police Department Investigating Officer and final notification,
the Director of Public Works or his designee shall cause the signs indicating
reserved parking to be removed.

section and criteria listed. Drop-off zones for persons with disabilities shall
meet the following criteria:
      (1)   The person or entity seeking the drop-off zone for persons with
disabilities must demonstrate the need for such a zone. Factors to be
considered in determining the need for such a drop-off zone shall include the
following: the number of persons with disabilities traveling to and from the
proposed drop-off zone location, the frequency of this activity, the
difficulties encountered without the proposed drop-off zone and the alternate
solutions available.
      (2)   The proposed drop-off zone for persons with disabilities shall not
have a substantial negative impact on existing parking and traffic conditions
in the area.
      (3)   The need which must be demonstrated under this division (G) must
not be the need for parking for persons with disabilities, but rather the need
for a location to stop a vehicle which carries a person or persons with
disabilities only long enough to drop off or pick up such person or persons
from a designated place. The regular use of special motor vehicles or buses for
the transport of persons with disabilities to and from a designated place shall
be considered as evidence indicating the need for a drop- off zone for persons
with disabilities, rather than the need for parking for persons with
disabilities.
      (4)   Drop-off zones can be up to eight feet in length, based on the
review procedures described herein.
   (H)   Section 11-1301.3 of the State Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-1301.3) is hereby incorporated into this section by reference.
   (I)   City Council reserves the right to limit the number of spaces on a
block.
   (J)   City staff has the right and authority to review and reevaluate the
current use of parking spaces for the permanently disabled pursuant to this
section and shall make recommendations to the City Council as to any such
reserved parking spaces which may no longer be appropriate. The City Council
shall have the right to revoke any reserved parking spaces previously approved.
   (K)   Applicable portions of this section shall be applied to traffic
warning signs for handicapped or disabled residents. These requests shall
follow the same application, payment, review and renewal processes described
herein. Alternate solutions will be considered prior to the installation of
these signs. Approval of these signs shall be subject to the Director of Public
Works.
   (L)   No person shall sell, assign, rent or lease any disabled parking
permit sticker or charge a fee for the use thereof. No person shall file a
sworn affidavit, as required herein, which the person knows to be false or
believes to be false at the time of filing.
   (M)   No person shall continue to display a disabled parking permit sticker
which has been terminated, cancelled and recalled pursuant to this section.
   (N)   It shall be unlawful for any person to park a motor vehicle or stop a
motor vehicle for the purpose of loading or unloading persons or things, other
than persons with disabilities, in any public parking area posted as a drop off
zone for persons with disabilities.
   (O)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined
not more than $250, except that anyone who fraudulently uses a handicapped
parking permit in violation of this chapter, shall be subject to a $500 fine.

§ 616.07 DOGS AND CATS.
   (A)   Impounding animals running at large and unlicensed animals. Any dog,
cat or other animal found running at large, as set forth in §
616.02, or a dog or cat for which the annual license fee has not been paid, as
provided in division (b) of this section, shall be impounded by the Police
Department.
      (1)   Notice of impoundment. The animal control officer, or such other
person as may from time to time be designated, shall immediately upon receiving
or impounding any animal make a complete registry, entering the breed, color,
and gender of such animal and whether licensed or not. If licensed or chipped,
the animal control officer shall include the main address of the owner and the
number of the license tag if known and shall give notice forthwith to the owner
informing him or her of the impounding of the animal. The animal control
officer shall make every reasonable attempt to contact the owner as soon as
possible. The animal control officer shall give notice of not less than seven
calendar days to the owner, if known, prior to the transfer of the animal to a
no-kill shelter. Such notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the
owner if available. Testimony of the animal control officer, or his authorized
agent, who mails such notice shall be evidence of the receipt of such notice by
the owner of the animal.
      (2)   Redemption of impounded licensed animals. When any licensed animal
is impounded as provided for in this chapter, it may be redeemed by its owner
upon payment of all applicable fees, penalties and costs as set forth in this
Code, including a fee equal to the cost per day to board and care for such
animal for each day the animal has been impounded. If such animal is not
redeemed by the owner within seven calendar days after the notice of
impoundment is sent to the owner, the animal control officer shall transfer the
animal to a no-kill shelter.
      (3)   Redemption of impounded unlicensed animals. Every animal that is
impounded as provided for in this chapter, for which no license or
identification has been obtained, shall be held for four calendar days before
being transferred to a no-kill shelter. Any person desiring to redeem an animal
so impounded may do so by paying the applicable fees, penalties and costs as
set forth in §
616.99, plus the license fee for the current license year and a reasonable fee
to cover the cost of housing and feeding such animal. No such animal shall be
released without being neutered/spayed and chipped or without a written
agreement from the person desiring to redeem the animal. However, any cat with
no license or identification, and who’s behaviors/physical markers observed are
determined to be non-domesticated (avoids human contact, rarely vocalized,
avoids eye contact, lean and rough in appearance) will be considered a feral
cat. The agreement will state that the animal will be neutered/spayed and
chipped, and, if applicable, the animal shall also be inoculated for rabies.
Vaccination and other veterinary costs may be assessed to the person redeeming
the animal. In the event that the animal trapped is a feral cat, the cat will
be neutered, inoculated for rabies microchipped, ear tipped, and registered
with the city’s Trap, Neuter, Release Working Cats Program and then released in
the location the cat was obtained or placed with a care giver if available.
      (4)   Redemption of dangerous animals. In the case of an animal that has
been determined to be dangerous, as defined in §
616.01, the animal may not be redeemed unless the owner supplies proof that
such animal will not thereafter be kept or housed in the city, including the
exact location where such animal will be kept so that the city may provide the
applicable governmental authorities with notice of the animal's new location
and the city's dangerous dog declaration (referenced in §
616.04).
      (5)   Injured animals. Any injured animal which has been impounded may be
given medical treatment or if deemed seriously ill or injured by an animal
officer certified by the National Animal Control Association or a licensed
Illinois veterinarian may be humanely dispatched by and under the direction of
a licensed Illinois veterinarian or an animal officer certified by the National
Animal Control Association in accordance with applicable law. The fee or
charges for such veterinary services shall be deemed to be and shall be
included as a cost and expense incurred in the impoundment of such animal.
      (6)   Adoption. The city and its agents and contractors shall make a good
faith effort to place any unredeemed animal with an appropriate individual or
individuals for adoption or with a humane society or other agency which has, as
one of its primary purposes, the placement of animals for adoption. Such
agencies shall be licensed as required by state and/or local law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unredeemed or unlicensed animal which has
been examined by a licensed veterinarian or an animal officer certified by the
National Animal Control Association and found by same to be seriously ill or
injured or dangerous may be immediately euthanized.
   (B)   License tax; tags. Every person who owns, keeps or harbors a dog or
cat in the city shall register the same with the City Collector and pay to the
Collector annually, or upon acquiring a dog or cat not previously registered,
an annual license fee of $10 per animal. The owner of any cat or dog not
registered with the city shall be fined no less than $75 for each animal
impounded by the city for any purpose.
      (1)   The Collector shall not issue a license for a dog or cat until the
owner or keeper thereof produces satisfactory evidence to the Collector that
the dog or cat has been vaccinated against rabies by a qualified veterinarian
within the preceding 12 months.
      (2)   The Collector shall provide, each year to each person paying the
tax, a metal tag for each dog or cat for which the license tax has been paid,
the tag to be stamped with the letters “B.D.T.” and the number of the license.
Every person keeping or harboring a dog or cat so licensed shall maintain a
collar around the neck of the dog or cat with the metal tag securely fastened
thereto. Every dog or cat not bearing the tag required by this section shall be
impounded by the Chief of Police and dealt with as provided in division (A)
hereof, and the owner thereof shall be subject to the penalties provided in §
616.99.
   (C)   Impoundment of animals that bite. The owner or person having custody
of a dog or cat which bites a person or domestic animal shall keep the dog or
cat locked up in an enclosure for a period of two weeks following the time the
dog or cat has bitten the person. The owner or person having custody shall also
immediately notify the Board of Health and the Police Department of the
incident and shall have the dog or cat examined by a physician or a licensed
veterinarian at the commencement and termination of the two-week period. If the
dog or cat dies or shows definite signs of illness during the period, the owner
or person having custody of the dog or cat shall turn the dog or cat over to
the Chief of Police so that it can be determined whether or not the dog or cat
has rabies. A dog determined to be dangerous pursuant to § 616.04 shall not be
released to the owner or person having custody of the dog unless the owner has
proof that the dangerous dog will not be kept or housed in the city, including
giving the exact location where the dangerous dog will be kept such that the
city can give the applicable governmental authorities notice of the dog’s new
location and the city dangerous dog declaration.

official notices of the city are customarily published, and, at his or her
discretion, may post notices at public places, forbidding the running at large
of a specific dog or cat in the city at any period whenever in his or her
opinion the public safety is in danger from the cause, unless the dog or cat is
securely muzzled, or prohibiting the running at large of any dog or cat. Upon
the publication of the notice, no dog or cat shall run at large in violation of
the notice. A dog or cat found running at large in violation of the notice may
be killed by a police officer.
   (E)   Number permitted. No person shall keep or harbor, in the city, more
than three dogs or cats over two months old on any premises occupied by one
family or more. Different parties living on the same premises or in the same

than three dogs or cats.

a leash, shall allow the dog or cat to urinate or defecate on any property
other than that of the person and the animal feces shall immediately be cleaned
from the place of deposit. No person shall allow a dog or cat to defecate on
any property other than that of the person or on a public street, alley,
ground, parkway, thoroughfare, lot or other public property, without

provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to those involving proper
removal of animal waste.

§ 666.07 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

streets, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots,
automobiles (whether moving or not) and buildings open to the general public,
including those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the

§ 666.075 GANG LOITERING.

sight or hearing of the place at which the order was issued during the next
three hours.
   (B)   The Chief of Police shall, by written directive, designate areas of
the city in which the Chief has determined that enforcement of this section is
necessary because gang loitering has enabled criminal street gangs to establish
control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas
or to conceal illegal activities. Prior to making a determination under this
division, the Chief shall consult as he or she deems appropriate with persons
who are knowledgeable about the effects of gang activity in areas in which this
section may be enforced. The persons may include but need not be limited to
members of the Police Department with special training or experience related to
criminal street gangs; other personnel of that Department with particular
knowledge of gang activities in the proposed designated area; elected and
appointed officials of the area; community-based organizations; and

The Chief of Police shall develop and implement procedures for the periodic
review and update of designations made under this division.

to prevent the enforcement of this section against persons who are engaged in

to the provision of this section.
   (B)   In the event that the petitioner that paid the mandatory
administrative processing fee of $50 is found not guilty or without probable
cause, the matter in which the petitioner was charged and required to pay the
fee was stricken on leave, nolle prosequi, abated or otherwise dismissed or
terminated without adjudication of guilt or liability with an order of
supervision entered, or the arrest warrant pertaining to the charge with which
the petitioner was charged and required to pay the fee was quashed, the
mandatory administrative processing fee may be returned to the petitioner. The
petitioner shall be entitled to a pre-seizure administrative hearing prior to
paying the mandatory administrative processing fee to the city.
   (C)   A Hearing Officer shall be appointed pursuant to the provisions set
forth below to adjudicate petitions for reimbursements of the mandatory

hearings over which the Hearing Officer shall preside;
      (2)   Orientation to the applicable subject area;

      (4)   Participation in hypothetical cases, including ruling on evidence
and issuing final orders; and
      (5)   A Hearing Officer must be an attorney licensed to practice law in
the state for at least three years.
   The Mayor is hereby authorized to appoint the Hearing Officer to adjudicate
the liability of petitioners as well as any other person to any other position
that is deemed necessary for the effective and efficient management of the
adjudication of hearings for reimbursements of the mandatory administrative
processing fee.
   (D)   The city shall provide the petitioner notice of the time, date and
location of the adjudication hearing. Minimally, the notice shall set forth the
penalties for failure to appear at the hearing and in all respects and
instances be made in accordance with all applicable laws.
   (E)   Service of the notice of the adjudicative hearing shall be made by the
person issuing the notice by:
      (1)   Handing the notice to the petitioner or delivering the notice to
any person 12 years of age or older at the residence of the petitioner; or
      (2)   Mailing the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to
the petitioner.
   (F)   An administrative hearing to adjudicate petitioner's petition for a
reimbursement on its merits shall be held at the date, time and place and in
the manner set forth in the notice that is served as required by this section.
All administrative hearings shall be recorded and shall culminate in a
determination of liability or non-liability, made by the Hearing Officer, who
shall consider facts and/or testimony without the application of the formal or
technical rules of evidence. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only
if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the
conduct of their affairs. The Hearing Officer shall, upon a determination of
liability, assess the relief as deemed equitable. Petitioners may be
represented by counsel at their own expense. The Hearing Officer shall be
permitted to award a reimbursement if the criminal charge supporting the
application of the mandatory administrative processing fee is found not guilty
or without probable cause, the matter in which the petitioner was charged and
required to pay the fee was stricken on leave, nolle prosequi, abated or
otherwise dismissed or terminated without adjudication of guilt or liability
with an order of supervision entered, or the arrest warrant pertaining to the
charge with which the petitioner was charged and required to pay the fee was
quashed.
   (G)   A final determination of liability shall occur after the Hearing
Officer's determination of liability, and the exhaustion of, or the failure to
exhaust, any administrative review procedures hereinafter set forth. When a
person fails to appear at the administrative hearing to contest the imposition
of the mandatory administrative processing fee on the date and at the time and
place specified in a prior served notice, the Hearing Officer's determination
of liability shall become final either upon the expiration of the time to
appeal or a denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination.
   (H)   Any final decision by a Hearing Officer shall constitute a final
determination for purposes of judicial review under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law. A finding made under this section is a debt due and owing the city
and may be collected in accordance with applicable law. A lien shall be imposed
on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount
of any debt due and owing the city under this section. The lien may be recorded
and enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction. No lien may be enforced under this section
until it has been recorded in the manner provided by Article XII of the Code of
Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code. The Hearing Officer may set
aside any judgment entered by default and set a new hearing date upon receipt
of a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of the order of default
if the Hearing Officer determines that the petitioner's failure to appear at
the hearing was for good cause, or at any time if the petitioner establishes
that the city did not provide proper service of process.

§ 802.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Because each commercial or industrial establishment located in the
city is a basic part of and affects the physical and economic well-being of the
city, necessitating special services from the city in the form of fire, health,
sanitation, building and police inspections and services, the commercial and
industrial establishments shall be in full compliance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (B)   This chapter is designed to provide for the means whereby the city may
render the necessary inspections and services to commercial or industrial
establishments, and commercial or industrial areas, in order to promote,
protect and safeguard the public health, safety and welfare and to enable the
effecting of an accurate record of commercial and industrial establishments
located and carrying on commercial or industrial activities or commerce in the
city.
   (C)   The commercial and industrial establishments regulated under this
chapter may or may not have their principal place of business located in the
city.
   (D)   The business regulation certificate fees provided for in this chapter
are not intended to license any business or profession or to be construed as an
endorsement of the competency or skill of any person.
   (E)   (1)   Business regulation certificate fees based upon the square foot
area of each place of business are predicated upon the premise that there is a
finite amount of square footage in all of the commercial or industrial zoning
districts in the city. The districts require substantial services over and
above the services provided for single-family homes and other residential uses.
The business activities conducted within the finite square foot area of the
commercial and industrial districts of the city require extra services
regardless of the activity being conducted within each commercial or industrial
space. Therefore, the fee is based equitably upon the square foot area of each
place of business as a minimum fee.
      (2)   The fee schedule set forth in §
802.11 may be based on additional factors other than square foot area of the
business establishment.
      (3)   Other fee charges are added for activities listed in §
802.13.
(Ord. passed 3-31-1980)
§ 802.02 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.

§ 825.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION.
   The Mayor and City Council expressly find and declare that:

   (B)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of tobacco
products causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical disorders;
   (C)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that nicotine
addiction from tobacco is similar to an addiction to cocaine and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in the country;

the majority of the 320,000 Americans who die each year from cigarette smoking
became addicted to nicotine as adolescents before the age of legal consent;
   (E)   The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cigarette smoking
precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use;
   (F)   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobacco
products to persons under the age of 21 has proven ineffective in preventing
the persons from using tobacco products; and
   (G)   The enactment of this chapter directly pertains to and is in
furtherance of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the residents of the
city, particularly those residents under 21 years of age.

(Ord. passed 10-23-1978)
§ 840.10 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Required. At least once every three months, the health authority shall
inspect each food service establishment located in the city, or its police
jurisdiction, and shall make as many additional inspections and reinspections
as are necessary for the enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)   Right of entry. The health authority, after proper identification, may
enter, at any reasonable time, any food service establishment in the city, or
its police jurisdiction, for the purpose of making inspections to determine
compliance with this chapter. The health authority may examine the records of
the establishment to obtain pertinent information pertaining to food and
supplies purchased, received or used and persons employed.
   (C)   Inspection records; demerit system. Whenever the health authority
makes an inspection of a food service establishment, he or she shall record his
or her findings on an inspection report form provided for this purpose, and
shall furnish the original of the inspection report form to the license holder
or operator. The form shall summarize the requirements of this chapter and
shall set forth a demerit point value for each requirement as violated by the
establishment. Upon completion of an inspection, the health authority shall
total the demerit point values for all requirements which are violated, the
total becoming the demerit score for the establishment.
   (D)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   Whenever the health authority makes an inspection of a food service
establishment and discovers that any of the requirements of this chapter have
been violated, he or she shall notify the license holder or operator of the
violations by means of an inspection report form or other written notice. In
the notification, the health authority shall:
         (a)   Set forth the specific violations found, together with the
demerit score of the establishment;
         (b)   Establish a specific and reasonable period of time for the
correction of the violations found, in accordance with the following
provisions:
            1.   When the demerit score of the establishment is 20 or less, all
violations of two or four demerit points must be corrected by the time of the
next routine inspection;
            2.   When the demerit score of the establishment is more than 20
but not more than 40, all items of two or four demerit points must be corrected
within a period of time not to exceed 30 days;
            3.   When one or more six demerit point items are in violation,
regardless of demerit score, the items must be corrected within a period of
time not to exceed ten days;
            4.   When the demerit score of the establishment is more than 40,
the establishment’s license is immediately suspended; and
            5.   In the case of a temporary food service establishment,
violations must be corrected within a specified period of time not to exceed 24
hours. Failure to comply with the notice shall result in immediate suspension
of the license.
         (c)   State the failure to comply with any notice issued in accordance
with this chapter may result in immediate suspension of the license (or the
establishment’s being downgraded); and
         (d)   State that an opportunity for appeal from any notice or
inspection findings will be provided if a written request for a hearing is
filed with the health authority within the period of time established in the
notice for correction.
      (2)   A notice provided for in this division shall be deemed to have been
properly serviced when the original of the inspection report form or other
notice has been delivered personally to the license holder or person in charge,
or the notice has been sent, by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the last known address of the license holder. A copy of the
notice shall be filed with the records of the health authority.

      (1)   Every food service establishment in the city, or its police
jurisdiction, shall display, in a place designated by the health authority, a
placard approved by the health authority stating the grade received at the time
of the most recent inspection of the establishment. Temporary food service
establishments, however, are not subject to grading. Grades of establishments
shall be as follows:
         (a)   Grade A, which means an establishment having a demerit score of
more than 20;
         (b)   Grade B, which means an establishment having a demerit score of
more than 20 but not more than 30; and
         (c)   Grade C, which means an establishment having a demerit score of
more than 30 but not more than 40.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the grade criteria established in this division,
whenever a second consecutive violation of any item of two or four demerit
points is discovered, the license may be suspended or, in lieu thereof, the
establishment shall be downgraded to the next lower grade.
      (3)   Immediately following each inspection, the health authority shall
post the appropriate grade based upon the inspection findings, and shall issue
an appropriate notice in accordance with division (D) hereof.
      (4)   The license holder or the operator of an establishment, the grade
of which has been lowered, may at any time request an inspection for the
purpose of regrading the establishment. Within ten days following receipt of a
request, including a signed statement that the conditions responsible for the
lowering of the grade have, in the applicant’s opinion, been corrected, the
health authority shall make an inspection and thereafter as many additional
inspections as he or she may deem necessary to ensure himself or herself that
the applicant is complying with the higher grade requirements. If the findings
indicate compliance, the health authority shall award the higher grade.
(Ord. passed 10-23-1978)
§ 840.11 EXAMINATION OF FOOD.
   Food may be examined or sampled by the health authority as often as may be

authority may, upon written notice to the owner, or person in charge of, the
establishment, place a hold order on any food which he or she determines or has
probable cause to believe to be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated or
misbranded. Under a hold order, food shall be permitted to be suitably stored.
No person shall remove or alter a hold order, notice or tag placed on good by
the health authority, and neither the food nor the containers thereof shall be
relabeled, repacked, reprocessed, altered, disposed of or destroyed without the
permission of the health authority, except on order by a court of competent
jurisdiction. After the owner or person in charge has had a hearing, as
provided for in §
840.10(D), and on the basis of evidence produced at the hearing, or on the
basis of his or her examination in the event a written request for a hearing is
not received within ten days, the health authority may vacate the hold order or
may, by written order, direct the owner or person in charge of the food which
was placed under the hold order to denature or destroy the food or bring it
into compliance with this chapter. The order shall be stayed if the order is
appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction within three days.

establishments;
   (B)   The immediate closure of the food service establishment concerned
until, in the opinion of the health authority, no further danger of disease

vehicle in that space. Additionally, a plan for where it is anticipated the
vehicles in excess of the available legal off-street parking spaces number will
be parked must be submitted.
   (E)   No valet parking operator license shall be issued to any person who
has not submitted to a criminal history background check and found not to have
been convicted of a felony or convicted of any crime involving motor vehicles,
theft, fraud, deception or moral turpitude. If the applicant is a partnership,

operator license. If the applicant is a corporation, then each officer, manager
or director thereof and any stockholder owning in the aggregate of more than 5%
of the stock thereof must all be eligible to receive a valet parking operator

parking license sign is to be attached to the existing loading zone pole during
the hours of operation. The valet parking license sign shall only be displayed
and the zone shall only be in effect during the hours that valet service is
provided. A licensee’s improper display of or failure to display the valet
parking license sign, or use of the sign to restrict or exclude public parking
at unauthorized times or locations, shall subject the operator to the penalties
set forth in this chapter and other applicable provisions of this code. Every
licensee providing service must post the name of the operator and rate, if any,
onto the valet parking license sign in four-inch dark blue lettering. The City
Collector shall inspect the establishments to determine that the name and

parking operator’s license as to any business establishment being served for so
long as the licensee fails to post its rates and name as required herein.
   (B)   No valet parking operator shall park or suffer its agents to park
patrons’ vehicles upon the public way except under lawful conditions. The fine
for any parking or compliance violations incurred by a vehicle while in the
custody of a valet parking operator shall be the sole responsibility of the
valet parking operator and shall, upon the occurrence of a final determination
of liability, constitute a debt due and owing to the city. The valet parking
operator’s failure to pay any fine upon notice by the city shall subject the
operator to the penalties set forth in this chapter and other applicable
provisions of this code. The City Collector is authorized to seek restitution
with respect to any fine paid by the patron of the valet parking operator.
   (C)   Every valet parking operator shall place or cause his or her agent to
place on the dashboard of each patron vehicle a sign or placard of a size no
smaller than eight and one-half inches by eleven inches in manner so as to be
conspicuously visible through the windshield of the patron vehicle. The sign or
placard shall contain the following information in red or black letters no less
than one inch in height: “This Vehicle Parked By (valet parking operator) For
Customer Of (business establishment).” In addition, each attendant of a valet
parking operator shall, while on duty, wear conspicuously placed on his or her
clothing, an insignia which identifies the valet parking operator for whom the
attendant is working.
   (D)   All valet parking attendants must, upon taking custody of a patron’s
vehicle, issue a numbered receipt to each customer containing the name, address
and telephone number of the company providing the valet service, a statement
that the company has liability insurance as required by §
877A.03(B), the charge for the valet service, the time and date the valet
parking operator took custody of the vehicle, and the license plate number of
the vehicle. When a valet parking attendant returns custody of the vehicle to
the owner, the attendant must time stamp the receipt with the time and date the
valet parking operator surrendered custody of the vehicle and return it to the
patron.
   (E)   Every valet parking operator or attendant shall carry on his or her
person a valid current driver’s license at all times while in control of a
patron’s vehicle. In addition to the penalties otherwise provided for violation
of this section, any person violating this division shall be subject to a fine
of not less than $100, nor more than $500 for each offense, which may be

feet of a school or a place of worship under the religious corporation act, is
ineligible to operate a video gaming terminal. The location restrictions in
this division (C) do not apply if a facility operated by an organization

moves to or is established within the restricted area after a video gaming
location becomes licensed under the Video Gaming Act. For the purposes of this

located within 1,000 feet from a facility operated by an organization licensee
or an inter-track wagering licensee licensed under the Horse Racing Act or the

location, the Liquor Commissioner shall consider the impact of any economic
concentration of such operation of video gaming. The Liquor Commissioner shall
not approve a video gaming location if the Liquor Commissioner determines such
location will result in undue economic concentration. For purposes of this

      (1)   The burden is upon each applicant to demonstrate his or her
suitability for licensure. Each operator of a video gaming location located in

to enable the Illinois Gaming Board or its designee to activate or deactivate
individual gaming devices from the central communications system. In no event
may the communications system approved by the Illinois Gaming Board limit
participation to only one manufacturer of video gaming terminals by either the
cost in implementing the necessary program modifications to communicate or the
inability to communicate with the central communications system;

itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of
the existence of any common law or statute that might make improper the
admission of evidence over objection in a civil action. Hearsay may support a
finding of the Liquor Commissioner if it is the best evidence available, has
sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and reliability and is of the type
reasonably and customarily relied on in the video gaming industry.
         (a)   If relevant and not precluded from the hearing by section 6(d)
of the Riverboat Gambling Act relating to all licensed applicants, official
Illinois Gaming Board records or certified copies of the records shall be

      (2)   The parties should, to the fullest extent possible, stipulate to
all matters that are not or fairly should not be in dispute.

objection is made, the Liquor Commissioner may receive the disputed evidence
subject to a ruling at a later time.

accepted information or technical or scientific matter within the field of

reasonable opportunity to refute that information.

more issues.
      (2)   If an applicant fails to testify on his or her own behalf with
respect to any question propounded to him or her, the Liquor Commissioner may
infer that such testimony or answer would have been adverse to the petitioner's
case.

proceeding shall constitute an admission of all matters and facts contained in

without any further notice to the applicant.
   (I)   Hearing record and order.

         (a)   The notice of denial, the request for hearing and all motions
and rulings;

         (d)   Offers of proof, objections and rulings.
      (2)   Upon conclusion of the hearing the Liquor Commissioner shall review
the entire record and shall render a written order including written findings
of fact and conclusions of law on which the Liquor Commissioner's decision is
based. The findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and on
matters officially noticed.

express mail to applicant's last known address.

§ 887.05 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the purchaser by
the person maintaining a place of business in this state who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser
to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and, if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this chapter and any
tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt owed
to the municipality by the person delivering the electricity, provided that the
person delivering electricity shall be allowed a credit for the tax related to
deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible, and provided, further, that if the charges are thereafter
collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit the tax. Persons
delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding the
tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering
electricity shall also be authorized to add to the gross charge an amount equal
to 3% of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the expense
incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns,
remitting the tax and supplying data to the municipality upon request. If the
person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then
the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the municipality in
the manner prescribed by the municipality. Persons delivering electricity who
file returns pursuant to this section shall, at the time of filing the return,
pay the municipality the amount of the tax collected pursuant to this chapter.

forth in this chapter and who is not otherwise exempted from paying the tax,
shall make a return to the City Collector for the preceding month stating:
      (1)   His or her name;
      (2)   His or her principal place of business;
      (3)   His or her gross receipts and/or kilowatt hour usage during the
month upon the basis of which the tax is imposed;
      (4)   The amount of tax; and
      (5)   Other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.
   (B)   The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time
of making the return, pay to the city the amount of tax herein imposed;
provided that in connection with any return, the taxpayer may, if he or she so
elects, report and pay an amount based upon his or her total billings of
business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made
(exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later
payments based upon any differences between the billings and the taxable gross
receipts.
(Ord. 99-12, passed 3-23-1999)
§ 887.07 ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS; TIME LIMITATION ON ACTIONS TO RECOVER TAX DUE.
   (A)   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not
due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as the result of a mistake of
fact or an error of law, then the amount shall be credited against any tax due,
or to become due, under this chapter from the taxpayer who made the erroneous
payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than three years prior
to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited.
   (B)   No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of
this chapter shall be commenced more than three years after the due date of the
amount.
(Ord. 99-12, passed 3-23-1999)

EFFECTIVENESS OF MUNICIPAL UTILITY TAX.
   In the event that ILCS Ch. 35, Act 620, §§ 1 et seq. is declared
unconstitutional, or if this chapter is voided by court action, the provisions
of
Chapter 886 of these Codified Ordinances (commonly known as the gross receipts
utility tax) shall remain in effect in all respects as if it had never been
amended by this chapter, and any amounts paid to the city by any person
delivering electricity pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to have been

adoption of this chapter.

taxes imposed by the city, the state or any other political subdivision of the
state.
(Ord. 94-13, passed 3-8-1994)
§ 888.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN REAL PROPERTY. Includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   The beneficial interest in a state land trust;
      (2)   The lessee’s interest in a ground lease (including any interest of
the lessee in related improvements) that provides for a term of 30 or more
years when all options to renew or extend are included, whether or not any
portion of the term has expired; or
      (3)   The indirect interest in real property as reflected by a
controlling interest in a real estate entity.
   CITY.  The City of Berwyn.
   CITY COLLECTOR. The City Collector or his or her agents.
   CONTROLLING INTEREST.
      (1)   Fifty percent or more of the combined voting power or fair market
value of all ownership interests or beneficial interests in a real estate
entity, whether the interests are owned by one or by several persons; or
      (2)   The right of one or of several persons to receive, at the time of
any distribution, 50% or more of the income or profits of a real estate entity.
   PERSON.  Any individual, receiver, administrator, executor, conservator,
assignee, trust, estate, partnership, joint venture, club, joint stock company,
business trust, political subdivision of the state, corporation, association,
limited liability company, syndicate, society or group of persons acting as a
unit, whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise. Whenever
used in a clause prescribing and imposing a penalty, the term PERSON, as
applied to associations, means the owners or part owners thereof, and, as
applied to corporations, means the officers thereof.
   REAL ESTATE ENTITY. Any person (other than a state land trust), including
but not limited to any partnership, corporation, trust or single or multi-
tiered entity, that exists or acts substantially for the purpose of holding,
directly or indirectly, title to, or beneficial interest in, real property
located in the city, whether for personal use, the production of rental income
or investment. It shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise, that an entity is
a real estate entity if it owns, directly or indirectly, real property located
in the city having a fair market value greater than 75% of the total fair
market value of all of the entity’s assets, determined without deduction for
any mortgage, lien or encumbrance.
   TRANSFER PRICE. The consideration furnished for the transfer of title to, or
beneficial interest in, real property, valued in money, whether paid in money
or otherwise, including cash, credits and property, determined without any
deduction for mortgages, liens or encumbrances, and specifically including the
amount of any indebtedness or obligation canceled or discharged in connection
with the transfer. In the case where the controlling interest in a real estate
entity is transferred, and the real estate entity holds assets in addition to
title to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the city, the
term TRANSFER PRICE means only that portion of the consideration attributable
to the transfer of the real property or the beneficial interest.
   TRUST DOCUMENT. The document required to be recorded under the Land Trust
Recordation and Transfer Tax Act, ILCS Ch. 765, Act 420, §§ 1 et seq.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a tax is hereby imposed
upon the privilege of transferring title to, or beneficial interest in, real
property located in the city, whether or not the agreement or contract
providing for the transfer is entered into in the city.
   (B)   The tax shall be at the rate of $10 per $1,000 of the transfer price,
or fraction thereof, of the real property or the beneficial interest in real
property.

recording of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer, whichever is
earlier.
      (2)   In the case of an assignment of a beneficial interest in a trust,
delivery shall be deemed to occur when the trustee receives possession of a
valid assignment of the beneficial interest. In the case of other transfers,
delivery shall be deemed to occur when the transferee, or the transferee’s
representative or agent, receives or becomes entitled to receive possession of
the instrument of transfer.
   (D)   The primary incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are
on the seller, grantor, assignor or other transferor, provided, however, that
if the transferor is exempt from the tax solely by operation of state law, then
the incidence of the tax and obligation to pay the tax shall be upon the
transferee.
   (E)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be due whether the transfer of a
controlling interest in a real estate entity is effected by one transaction or
by a series of related transactions. For purposes of this division, it shall be
presumed, unless proven otherwise, that transactions are related if they occur
within the same 24-month period.
   (F)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impose a tax upon any
transaction or privilege which, under the Constitutions of the United States or
the state, may not be made the subject of taxation by the city.
(Ord. 94-13, passed 3-8-1994)
§ 888.025 LIMITED REFUNDS FROM TAX.
   (A)   Eligibility for refund. A partial or full refund of the tax paid
pursuant to §
888.02 shall be available to a person who furnishes evidence satisfactory to
the City Collector that:
      (1)   He or she held a percentage ownership of a single-family residence
located in the city and that the property was his or her principal residence
during three of the last five years;
      (2)   He or she closed the sale of this local residence by transferring
title by deed or by transferring the beneficial interest (if the property was
the subject of a land trust);
      (3)   Within six months preceding or following the sale, he or she
purchased a percentage ownership of a separate single-family residence also
located in the city;
      (4)   He or she currently occupies a second purchased single-family
residence as his or her principal residence and he or she intends to continue
to do so for at least five years;
      (5)   He or she is not otherwise indebted to the city in any amount and
for any reason; or
      (6)   He or she has not applied for a refund of city real estate transfer
taxes within the past ten years.
   (B)   Multi-family buildings.  
      (1)   If a person otherwise qualifies for a refund under divisions (A)(1)
through (6) hereof, with the exception that the property in question was not a
separate single-family residence, but a multi-family building, the person may
be eligible for a refund if the following criteria are met:
         (a)   The person occupied a unit in the multi-family building as his
or her principal residence;
         (b)   The property sold is no more than a legal or legal nonconforming
three-unit building; and
         (c)   The property purchased has the same number or a lesser number of
dwelling units and the person occupies one of the units as his or her principal
residence.
      (2)   The computation of the refund shall be as prescribed in division
(D) hereof. However, notwithstanding the provisions of division (D) hereof, the
refund shall be limited to one-half of the allowable sum for two-unit buildings
and one-third of the allowable sum for three-unit buildings. A $50 processing
fee will apply on all refunds.
   (C)   Application procedure.  A person applying for the refund shall do so
by completing an application form to be provided by the City Collector’s
office. This application must be sworn or attested to by the applicant before a
notary public and must be personally signed by the applicant or his or her
legal representative. The applicant shall submit any and all documentation
requested by the City Collector’s office to determine his or her eligibility
for the refund.
   (D)   Computation of refund. The refund shall be determined by multiplying
the amount of actual real estate transfer tax paid on the sale of the first
sold principal single-family residence by the percentage of ownership the
applicant held in the city single-family residence sold, or by the percentage
of ownership the applicant holds in the city single-family residence purchased,
whichever is lower.
   (E)   Falsification.  
      (1)   No person shall submit in his or her application for a refund any
statements, information or facts which are false, incomplete or otherwise
misleading.
      (2)   No person shall submit to the city, in connection with his or her
application for a refund, any documents or materials which contain false,
incomplete or otherwise misleading statements or facts.
      (3)   No person, except a duly designated legal representative, shall
sign an application for a refund on behalf of another person.
      (4)   No person shall advise or otherwise lend support to a person in the
preparation or submission of an application for a refund containing any false,
incomplete or otherwise misleading statements or facts.

§ 888.03 PAYMENT OF TAX BY USE OF STAMPS; RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Except in the case of tax paid pursuant to §
888.15, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the purchase of tax
stamps issued by the City Collector or his or her agent. While the primary
incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax is on the seller,
grantor, assignor or other transferor, no purchaser, grantee, assignee or other
transferee shall accept a conveyance if the tax has not been paid. If the tax
has not been paid and the revenue transfer stamps provided for in §
888.07 are not affixed to the deed, then the title of the purchaser, grantee,
assignee or other transferee shall be subject to the lien provided for in §
888.11, and the purchaser, grantee, assignee or other transferee is liable for
any unpaid tax imposed by this chapter, together with interest and all
applicable penalties. The tax shall be in addition to any and all other taxes.
   (B)   It shall be the duty of the person or persons liable for the tax to
affix, or cause to be affixed, the appropriate number and denomination of
stamps to the face of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer. Any
person affixing a stamp shall cancel it in accordance with §
888.07.

   (A)   At or before the time that the tax imposed by this chapter is due, or,
in the case of an exempt transfer, at or before the time that the deed,
assignment or other instrument of transfer is delivered, there shall be filed
with the City Collector a real property transfer declaration signed by at least
one of the transferors and also signed by at least one of the transferees, or
by their respective attorneys or agents. The declaration shall be on a form
prescribed by the City Collector and shall contain information as the City
Collector may reasonably require.
   (B)   In the case that the subject transfer involves a beneficial interest
in real property as defined in §
888.01, included with the filing of the real property transfer declaration with
the City Collector shall be a copy of the land trust agreement or other legal
instrument (including amendments thereto) which identifies each current holder
of the beneficial interest in the subject real estate by name and address and
defines his or her interest therein both as to the transferor and as to the
transferee, if applicable, together with a statement on a form to be provided
by the City Collector for the person filing same to verify, under the penalties
of perjury (as defined in the Illinois Compiled Statutes), that the land trust
agreement or other legal instrument truly, accurately and completely identifies
each current holder of such beneficial interest in the subject real estate by
name and address and defines his or her interest therein.

   (B)   (1)   The City Collector may, from time to time, provide for the

superseded issue or design may, not later than 90 days after the effective date

to the Real Estate Transfer Tax Law, ILCS Ch. 35, Act 200, § 31-25, as amended,
shall be filed with the City Clerk by the grantee of a deed or assignment of
beneficial interest within ten days after delivery of the deed or assignment of
beneficial interest or at the time of payment of tax imposed by this chapter,
whichever first occurs.
   (B)   A real estate agent who acts as broker or agent for the sale of any
real estate in the city shall file, within ten days after the delivery of the

declaration as provided in §

§ 888.11 LIENS FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (A)   In the event that the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when
due, the city shall have a lien against the related real property in an amount
equal to the tax, together with all applicable interest and penalties. The lien
shall expire only at the time as the outstanding tax, interest and penalties
are paid in full, the lien is foreclosed or the period for bringing a
foreclosure action described in division (C) hereof expires.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to give the city’s lien a
preference or priority over the rights of any bona fide purchaser, holder of a
security interest, mechanics lienor, mortgagee or judgment lien creditor
arising or existing prior to the recording of an instrument, evidencing the
city’s lien, with the Recorder of Deeds of the county; provided, however, that
the city’s lien, whether or not recorded, shall have priority over any interest
in the real property, including any lien acquired by a person in connection
with the person providing financing to the transferee taxpayer or the
taxpayer’s nominee or designee for the acquisition of the real property. The
absence of tax stamps in the proper amount on the deed, assignment or other
instrument of transfer pursuant to which the transferee taxpayer acquired title
to, or beneficial interest in, the real property, shall constitute constructive
notice of the city’s lien to the person providing financing.
   (C)   The city may not commence an action to foreclose upon the lien more
than seven years after the transfer giving rise to the tax liability; provided,
however, that the running of the seven-year period shall be tolled for the
duration of any judicial order enjoining or restraining the city from
instituting a foreclosure proceeding.

month, commencing as of the first day following the day when the tax becomes
due.
   (B)   Any transferor or transferee who fails to file with the City Collector
a real estate transfer declaration as required by §

888.15, prior to the City Collector issuing a notice of tax audit,
investigation or liability in connection with the transfer of title to, or
beneficial interest in, real property, shall be subject to a penalty equal to
the amount of the applicable tax. This penalty shall be in addition to any tax
and interest due.

§ 894.15 APPLICATION FOR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF TAX DUE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment from the
Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary
disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator.
However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and
interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a
final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount
owed or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.

Clerk’s office.

§ 894.17 LIENS.
   The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayer for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city’s expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

authorized by this chapter, the city infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all public
rights-of-way within the city by telecommunications retailers. Imposition of

however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or the imposition of
any other fees otherwise authorized by law.

than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in which a bill is

to this chapter, and any infrastructure maintenance fee collected by the
telecommunications retailer, shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the city. The charge imposed under division (A)
hereof by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who

shall be credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become
due, under this chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the
erroneous payment, provided, however, that the Mayor may request, and the
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for the

telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.

Utilities Act.
   (G)   The city shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books
and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
city for the infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the amount of
the infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by the telecommunications
retailer shall be paid to the city, plus 5% of the total amount of the
underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by the city in
conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total amount of the
underpayment determined in an audit. The sum shall be paid to the city within
21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice for the same.
   (H)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, may promulgate further or
additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of this
chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to time
and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered pursuant
to §
899.02 of the regulations.

§ 1010.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city’s
jurisdiction, which will provide benefits to the public, including the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual quality of the city’s
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. By enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way located in the city and, in particular, the
use of the public ways and property by utilities. The city intends to
effectuate the foregoing by establishing uniform standards to address issues
presented by utility facilities, which standards seek to accomplish the
following:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior
to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired
and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may
be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar
agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way located within the city. Utilities that are not required by law to enter
into such an agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement.
In such an agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions
inconsistent with this chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility, other than a telecommunications provider, has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with or
inconsistency between the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapter. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards, conditions
and requirements expressed in this chapter when the city so determines. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to
regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and
welfare.

   (E)   Applicant’s duty to update information. Throughout the entire permit
application review period and the construction period authorized by the permit,
any amendments to information contained in a permit application shall be
submitted by the utility in writing to the city within 30 calendar days after
the change necessitating the amendment.
   (F)   Application fees. For utility facilities, unless otherwise provided by
franchise, license or similar agreement, all applications for permits pursuant
to this chapter shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of $1,000. No
application fee is required to be paid by any electricity utility that is

§ 1010.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Building
Department within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and
regulations, the Building Department shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Building Director or designee is satisfied
that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter and
applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, the Building
Department shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Building Director or designee, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to chapter four of the Telephone Company Act (ILCS Ch.
220, Act 65, § 4), a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it
intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not less than ten calendar days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 calendar days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Public Works Director or
designee shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility
may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Public Works Director or designee fails to
specify the location to the telecommunications retailer within either: (i) ten
calendar days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction; or
(ii) 25 calendar days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
1010.04 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
city an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
submitted by a utility that is a holder of state-issued authorization shall be
deemed granted 45 calendar days after submission to the city, unless otherwise
acted upon by the city, provided the holder has complied with applicable city
codes, ordinances and regulations.
§ 1010.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted. No property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period of longer than six months, unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur
including, without limitation, the presence or absence of other utility
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of
other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction and
access and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.07 AS BUILT CONDITIONS DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit as built conditions drawings or plans to the city within 60 calendar
days after the completion of the permitted work. All as built conditions
drawings shall be provided via electronic submittal and said submissions must
include longitude and latitude and shall also be in microstation or auto-cad
format. The as built conditions drawings or plans shall specifically identify
where the locations of the actual facilities are installed. If the as built
conditions drawings deviate from the original permit, said deviations will be
treated as a request for a variance as provided for in this chapter. If the
city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove
the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms
to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by a
franchise, license or similar agreement, each utility occupying a right-of-way
or constructing any facility in a right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as a named insured
and naming the city and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents
and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)
and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred to as
“X,” “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability.
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten calendar days
following the receipt of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
may the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by the city, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
of a written notice addressed to the Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
   Within ten calendar days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event later than ten calendar days prior to said cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement of the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or to comply with the requirements of divisions
(B), (C) and (D) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
division (A) of this section, which evidence may include that the utility is a
“private self insurer” under the Workers’ Compensation Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act
305, §§ 1 et seq.).
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on a utility’s liability. The
legal liability of a utility to the city and any person for any of the matters
that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by
this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance
or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-” or better
and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents, independent contractors,
attorneys and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing
or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license or
similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct
or breach of this chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.10 SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section, at the permittee’s
sole cost and expense, until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all of the
requirements contained in this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by the permittee in violation of this chapter including,
without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work that the
permittee is required to perform pursuant to this chapter or work that the city
must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee’s failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the city
from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
   A performance bond shall be an amount of money filed with or placed with the
city or bonded by the permittee to provide for any repair, replacements or
restoration in the event that the permittee’s maintenance and restoration of
the right-of-way and adjacent facilities or city-owned properties fails and
timely repairs are not made as defined in this section.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund and performance
bond to the city in the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety
bond in a form acceptable to the city or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount.
      (1)   The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way, which
shall include but not be limited to streets, sidewalks, parkways, alleys, curbs
and other structures, appurtenances or implements that are standard to and/or
existing in the right-of-way, to at least as good a condition as that existing
prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Public Works
Building Director or designee, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Public Works Director or
designee may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post
a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
      (2)   The amount of the performance bond shall be 5% of the total project
but no less than a minimum of $5,000, whichever is higher.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 calendar days’ advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within
the 14 calendar day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to make acceptable repairs or if the repairs are performed by
the city, fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action, inaction or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
      The performance bond shall be held by the city for three years and shall
only be used by the city in the event that the permittee’s maintenance and
restoration of the right-of-way and adjacent facilities or city-owned
properties fails and the party refuses to repair or remedy the failed item
within five calendar days of receiving notice of the failure.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 calendar days after receipt of written notice
from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund or the
performance bond, the permittee shall restore the security fund performance
bond to the amount specified in division (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund; return of performance bond.
      (1)   Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion
thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken
for all offsets necessary to compensate the city for failure by the permittee
to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable laws. In the
event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all
accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the city to the extent
necessary to cover any reasonable costs, losses and/or damages incurred by the
city as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of
said costs, losses or damages shall be refunded to the permittee.
      (2)   The performance bond shall be returned to the party after three
years have passed from the date of the completion of the construction and after
final inspection by the city.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund or performance bond are in addition to all other rights of
the city, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law or
provided by city code, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to said security fund or performance bond shall affect any other right
that the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated.

suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the chapter, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately providing the city with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correcting, to the satisfaction of the city, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the city within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately removing the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across or within the rights-of-way and restoring the rights-of-way

to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: (1) correct the deficiencies; (2) upon
not less than 20 calendar days’ notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or (3) after not less than 30 calendar days’ notice to
the permittee of the failure to cure the non-compliance, deem the rights-of-way
abandoned and property of the city. The permittee shall be liable in all events
to the city for all costs of removal.

   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the city no less than
30 calendar days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in a right-
of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or
the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and shall comply with applicable laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations, including the provisions of this chapter,
with respect to the work and facilities in a right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the city’s right-of-
way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division
(A).
      (1)   No interference with city facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the Public Works Director or designee determines
that the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any
of the city’s utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation
or maintenance of any of the city’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and

way line or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of city highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90-degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or

structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway

shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (A)(4)
is permitted under § 1010.21 the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-7 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Public Works Director or designee. The Public Works Director
may, at his or her discretion, approve other materials and/or applications;
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the city;
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth; and
         (d)   For all rights-of-way that have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall be in compliance
with IDOT § 35-202(f), or the current standard for venting as provided for by
IDOT. No aboveground vent pipes shall be located in the area established as a
clear zone for that particular section of the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the city. All installations shall be in
accordance with the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Construction in
Illinois.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided

necessary to comply with city code and to ensure the safety and welfare of the
general public.
   (B)   Electric utilities – Compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in a right-of-way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and additionally, in accordance with such local franchise or other
agreement with the city as permitted by law.
   (C)   Other utilities – Tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in a right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable state laws and regulations specifically
governing the same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for and the issuance of a permit, in addition to
any other permit required under the City Code.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include an assurance that the work will be accomplished
by competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree
pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in
the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for the assessment of damages. The city will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or the unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (D)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.

      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates, to the satisfaction
of the Public Works Director or designee, that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control.

§ 1010.18 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 calendar days following written notice from the
city, a utility shall, at its sole expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any city
improvement or the operations of the city in or upon rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 calendar days following
written notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within any right-of-way shall,
at its sole expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
issuance of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the city shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to
cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within a
right-of-way of the city, the utility shall notify the city within 90 calendar
days. Following receipt of such notice, the city may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Public Works Director or
designee determines that such removal will be in the best interests of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the city does not direct
the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of
abandonment to the city, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to
the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another
utility, entity or person.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.19 CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten calendar days after any portion of a
right-of-way is disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the city. This includes
restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall
be made using materials and methods approved by the Public Works Director or
designee. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling,
regrading, reseeding, resodding or any other requirement to restore the right-
of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to
the commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may
be extended by the Public Works Director or designee for good cause shown.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.20 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility’s sole expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of a
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Public Works Director or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the Berwyn Police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019)
§ 1010.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for a variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or
more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the Public
Works Director or designee as a part of the permit application. The request
shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Public Works Director or designee
shall decide, on an individual basis, whether a variance is authorized for each
provision of this chapter identified in the variance request.
   (C)   Conditions for granting a variance. The Public Works Director or
designee may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance
has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Public Works Director or designee may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter, but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including the denial of a variance, made by the
Public Works Director or designee under the provisions of this chapter shall
have the right to appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission
as may be designated by the City Council. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the City Clerk within 30 calendar days after the date
of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The City Council shall
commence its consideration of the appeal at the City Council’s next regularly
scheduled meeting occurring at least seven calendar days after the filing of
the appeal. The City Council shall timely decide the appeal.

§ 1010.22 VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine or fines in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when
the city will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because
the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
city’s cost of damages and its costs for installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
(Ord. 19-21, passed 8-13-2019) Penalty, see §
202.99
§ 1010.23 ENFORCEMENT AND SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   Enforcement. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting
any additional or further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of
this chapter.
   (B)   Severability. If any section, subsection, division, sentence, clause,
phrase or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

§ 1020.01 TEMPORARY USE OF STREETS; PERMITS; LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   A person who wishes to use a public street, roadway, court, alley or
parkway in the city for the purpose of storing or depositing any building
material, machinery, tool, tool box, tool shed, fuel or other supply, for any
building or structure in the course of being constructed, moved, altered or
repaired, shall first make application in writing to the Director of Public
Works for permission to do so. The application shall describe the location of
the street, roadway, court, alley or parkway proposed to be occupied, the use
to be made of the same, and the length of time of the intended occupation.
Should the Director approve of the application, he or she shall grant
permission to the applicant, provided that the applicant has complied with all
the other provisions of this chapter and other city ordinances relating to
buildings, as to bonds, fees and all other requisites in connection with the
intended use. Permission to use a street, roadway, court, alley or parkway is
intended only for imperative use in connection with the actual erection,
repair, alteration, wrecking or removal of buildings or structures, and shall
terminate with the completion of the operation or at an earlier time as the
Director finds feasible and requires. No permission shall be granted for a
period longer than 90 days.
   (B)   No person shall occupy a sidewalk or street after the completion of
the operation for which the permit has been issued. No person shall occupy a
sidewalk or street for the storage of articles not intended for immediate use
in connection with the operation for which the permit has been issued.
   (C)   The occupation of the sidewalk or street for the storage of building
material shall not exceed one-third of the width of the roadway, and in all
cases where the obstruction of the street is made, there shall be a clear space
of not less than one foot between the obstruction and the curb line. However,
the Director may limit or entirely restrict the storage of materials on a
street or alley where a tunnel, conduit or any underground passageway or subway
is located. The permit required in this section does not authorize the
occupation of a sidewalk or street, or part thereof, other than that
immediately in front of the lot upon which a building is in the process of
erection and in relation to which the permit was issued. During the progress of
building operations, a sidewalk not less than six feet in width shall be at all
times kept open and unobstructed for the purpose of passage in front of the
lot. The sidewalk shall, if there are excavations on either side of the same,
be protected by substantial railings, which shall be built and maintained
thereon so long as excavations continue to exist.
§ 1020.02 REMOVAL AND TREATMENT OF CERTAIN OBSTRUCTIONS.
   Earth that is taken from an excavation, other than sand to be used in the
construction of a building, and rubbish taken from buildings shall not be
stored on the sidewalks or roadways of streets, and shall be removed therefrom
from day to day as rapidly as it is produced. When dry rubbish is being
handled, it shall be kept wetted down so as to prevent its being blown about by
the wind.
§ 1020.03 WARNING LIGHTS AT OBSTRUCTIONS AND EXCAVATIONS.
   Yellow lanterns shall be displayed and maintained overnight at each end of a
pile of material in a street or alley or of an excavation therein.
(Ord. 15-40, passed 11-10-2015)
§ 1020.04 REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF CURBS.
   (A)   Whenever it is necessary to remove a street curb for driveways or
other reasons, the contractor or person intending to do the work must obtain a
permit to do so. A request for a permit must imply that the contractor or
person is aware of the necessity to remove the gutter as well as the curb. All
work must conform to the requirements of and inspection by the Director of
Public Works. The fee for the permit is as set forth in §
1444.01(B)(45).
   (B)   As set forth in § 1248.10(A) of the Planning and Zoning Code of the
city, no parking is allowed in side or front yards, thus all driveways shall go
to the rear yard for parking.
(Ord. passed 3-31-1980)
§ 1020.05 PARADES AND OPEN AIR MEETINGS.
   (A)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a

property for the purpose of hearing speakers or discussing some matter of
common interest, where the number of participants expected may reasonably be
assumed to exceed 50.

      (5)   The purpose of the parade or meeting; and
      (6)   The approximate number of persons involved in the parade or
meeting.
   (D)   Investigation of application; permit issuance. The Superintendent of
Police or an officer delegated by him or her shall forthwith investigate the
person applying for the permit and the truth of the statements in the
application regarding the purpose of the event. The officer in charge of the
investigation shall notify the Superintendent in writing of his or her
findings. If the findings are that the parade or open air meeting will not be
held for any unlawful purpose, will not in any manner tend to be a breach of
the peace, will not unnecessarily interfere with the use of a public way or
with the peace and quiet of the residents of the city, the Superintendent shall
issue the permit.
   (E)   Permit denial; appeals. If the Superintendent of Police denies the
issuance of the permit, the applicant has the right to appear before the Mayor
and Council at any special or regular meeting and be heard on all aspects of
the application. The Mayor and Council may confirm the order of the
Superintendent or may overrule the Superintendent and order the issuance of the
permit.

   (A)   For and in consideration of a waiver by the county of the insurance
and surety bond requirements for projects or activities which may be undertaken
by the city involving a disturbance of any right-of-way of the county within
the city, it is hereby agreed that:
      (1)   The city or its successors or assigns shall indemnify and save
harmless the county, its officers, agents, employees and servants, against all
loss, damage or expense that it or they may sustain as a result of any suit,
action or claim of any character brought on account of property damage or
injury to or death of any person, including persons performing any work or
activity under a permit issued by the County Highway Department, which may
arise in connection with the work or activities to be performed under all
permits and arising in any manner from the negligence, wrongful acts or failure
to act by the city and its employees in the performance of the work or
activity; and
      (2)   The city shall, at its own expense, appear, defend and pay all
charges of attorneys, costs and other expenses arising therefrom or incurred in
connection therewith and, if any judgment is rendered against the county in any
action, the city shall, at its own expense, satisfy and discharge the same.
   (B)   The city shall also indemnify and save harmless the county from any
claims against the city, or liabilities to any person incurred by the city, of
any kind, arising from the city’s wrongful or negligent performance of the work
or activity.
   (C)   No amendment or repeal of this section shall become effective until 30
days next following written notice to the county of the proposed amendment or
repeal. The notice shall be served upon the county at the office of the
Superintendent of Highways.
   (D)   The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward to the
County Department of Highways, Permit Division, a certified copy of this
section upon its passage and approval.
   (E)   Nothing in this section negates the necessity of obtaining a permit,
where the permit is otherwise required. This hold harmless agreement does not
negate bond and insurance requirements for private contractors doing work for
the municipality.
(Ord. 87-44, passed 8-25-1987)

   (J)   Variances.
      (1)   Whenever the standards of this section place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning, Planning
and Development Commission for a variance. The Zoning, Planning and Development
Commission shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit
its recommendation to the City Council. The City Council may attach such
conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
intent of this section.
         (a)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that all of the following conditions are met:
            1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the

a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP.
            7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
      (2)   The Zoning, Planning and Development Commission shall notify an
applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building
protections standards that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
         (a)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage;
         (b)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
         (c)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (K)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section repeals and replaces
other ordinances adopted by the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. However, this
section does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility to the program. Nor does this section repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this section and
other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (L)   Disclaimer of liability. The degree of protection required by this
section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This section does not imply that development either inside or
outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This section
does not create liability on the part of the city of any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this section
or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application process. The city shall process applications as
follows:
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the city fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the city in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th
day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day after the
receipt of the deemed approved notice by the city. The receipt of the deemed
approved notice shall not preclude the city's denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (c)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the city fails to approve or

approved notice shall not preclude the city's denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (d)   1.   The city shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
            2.   If the city determines that applicable codes, ordinances or

conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            3.   The city shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
city denies an application.
            4.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city
and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial
is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The city
shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the
applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement
of the city's review period.
            5.   The applicant must notify the city in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            6.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the

         (a)   Within 30 days after receiving an application, the city shall
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an
application is incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing
information. An application shall be deemed complete if the city fails to
provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents,
information and fees specifically enumerated in the city's permit application
form are submitted by the applicant to the city.
         (b)   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the city sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.

within the jurisdiction of the city shall be allowed, at the applicant's
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the city may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits.
         (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
city makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified
utility pole do not comply with the applicable city codes or any provision,
condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
         (b)   If the act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein,
renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable City Code provisions or

(Ord. 18-28, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 1080.04 COLLOCATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Public safety space reservation. The city may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the city's electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the city reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
   (B)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
   (C)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies. 
      (1)   The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities
shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for
public safety communications.
      (2)   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the
type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public
safety agency's communications equipment.
      (3)   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675.
      (4)   The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based
on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous division (3). Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
   (D)   Prohibited collocations.
      (1)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      (2)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      (3)   For purposes of this division, the terms "communications space,"
"communication worker safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   (E)   Compliance with codes. The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
   (F)   Compliance with design standards. The wireless provider shall comply
with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative
utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements
that are set forth in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a
comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers
of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic
district.
   (G)   Alternate placements. 
      (1)   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions
section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless
facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be
required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole.
However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless
facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that the
small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which
the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure
on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure
does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by
the applicant.
      (2)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this division.
   (H)   Height limitations.
      (1)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
      (2)   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
         (b)   45 feet above ground level.
   (I)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for
a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which
the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for a special use permit or variance in conformance with procedures,
terms and conditions set forth in §
1252.03(C) of the City of Berwyn Code of Ordinances (the "City Code").
   (J)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
   (K)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply
with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
   (L)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
   (M)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
(Ord. 18-28, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 1080.05 APPLICATION FEES.
   Application fees are imposed as follows:
   (A)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application to

and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment
consistent with §
1080.03(B)(1)(d); or
      (3)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement
of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung between
existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
   (E)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the city to work within
rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane
closures.

facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of § 16-108.5(i) of the Public Utilities Act.
      (2)   For the purposes of this division, PUBLIC UTILITY has the meaning
given to that term in § 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: (a) to

pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
   (C)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the city if it
sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
city. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider.
(Ord. 18-28, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 1080.10 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Cook County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
city shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual

be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 18-28, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 1080.11 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the city harmless against any
and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless

privileges granted under this chapter and the act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability.
(Ord. 18-28, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 1080.12 INSURANCE.
   (A)   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost
and expense, the following insurance:

wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage limits required by the city.

(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)
§ 1240.04 TRANSITION RULES.
   The following transition rules shall apply in determining the applicability
of this Code with respect to the previously applicable zoning regulations.
   (A)   Existing illegal uses, structures, and lots. Any use, structure, or
lot that was established illegally as of the effective date of this Zoning
Code, or its subsequent amendments, shall remain illegal if it does not conform
with the requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (B)   Permitted uses rendered special uses. If a use was classified as a
permitted use prior to the effective date of this Code, and is classified as a
special use as of the effective date of this Code, or its subsequent
amendments, that use shall be deemed a lawful special use. Any subsequent
addition, enlargement, or expansion of that use shall conform to this Code's
requirements for special uses.
   (C)   Special uses rendered permitted uses. If a use was classified as a
special use prior to the effective date of this Code, and is classified as a
permitted use as of the effective date of this Code, or its subsequent
amendments, that use shall be deemed a lawful permitted use. Any subsequent
addition, enlargement, or expansion of that use shall conform to this Code's
requirements for such permitted use and is no longer subject to the special use
ordinance under which it was originally approved.
   (D)   Uses rendered nonconforming. If a use was classified as a permitted or
special use prior to the effective date of this Code, and this Code no longer
classifies that use as either a permitted or special use in the zoning district
in which it is located, that use shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use and
shall be controlled by the provisions of §
1252.05 (Nonconformities).
   (E)   Structures and lots rendered nonconforming. If a structure or lot
existing on the effective date of this Code was conforming prior to the
effective date of this Code, and such structure or lot does not meet all
standards set forth in this Code, that structure or lot shall be deemed legally
nonconforming and shall be controlled by the provisions of §
1252.05 (Nonconformities).
   (F)   Previously issued building permits. If a building permit for a
building or structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this
Code, and if construction has begun within three months of the issuance of that
permit and diligently pursued to completion, the structure may be completed
based on the previously issued building permit, and may be occupied under an
occupancy permit for the use originally intended upon completion.
   (G)   Previously granted special uses and variations. All special uses and
variations granted prior to the effective date of this Code shall remain in
effect. The recipient of the special use or variation may proceed to develop
the property in accordance with the plans and any applicable conditions
approved by the City Council (refer to §
1252.01(B) (City Council) or Zoning, Planning, and Development Commission
(refer to §
1252.01(C) (Zoning, Planning, and Development Commission)). If the recipient
has failed to act on the special use or variation before the approval expires,
including any periods of extension granted, the provisions of this Code shall
govern.
   (H)   Pending applications. If an application has been submitted to the
city, but has not been scheduled for a public hearing or other required review
prior to the effective date of this Code, then the provisions of this Code
shall govern the application.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)

future tenses.
   (C)   Number. The singular number includes the plural number, and vice
versa.

"such as," or other similar phrases shall not be construed to be exclusive or
preclude the Zoning Administrator from interpreting the list to include
similar, unspecified examples.
   (E)   Shall and may. The word "shall" is mandatory, while the word "may" is

the city. Single-family dwellings, along with limited civic and institutional
uses, are allowed.
      (2)   R-2: Bungalow District. The R-2 Bungalow District is established to
accommodate residential development and improvements in a manner congruent with
the character of existing bungalow housing stock in the city. Single-family
dwellings and limited civic and institutional uses are allowed.
      (3)   R-3: Two-Family Residence District. The R-3 Two-Family Residence
District is established to accommodate the character of existing neighborhoods
that consist predominantly of two-family and single-family dwellings in the
city. Single-family and two-family dwellings, along with limited civic and
institutional uses, are allowed.

§ 1242.03 ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Establishment of zoning map. The location and boundaries of the
districts established in §
1242.02 (Establishment of Zoning Districts) are hereby established on the map
designated as the zoning map of the city and referred to herein as "zoning
map." The zoning map is adopted by reference and declared to be part of this
Code.
      (1)   Location of map. The zoning map shall be kept for reference on the
city's public website and in the offices of both the City Clerk and Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Zoning map amendments. All amendments to this Code (refer to §
1252.03(E) (Zoning Text and Map Amendment) which involve a change to the
district designation of a lot shall be recorded on the city's official zoning
map.
   (B)   Interpretation of boundary lines. The boundaries of all zoning
districts shown on the zoning map shall be determined in accordance with the
following rules:
      (1)   Right-of-way lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide
with streets, alleys, railroads, easements, or similar rights-of-way, the
centerline of the right-of-way shall be considered the boundary line of the
district.
      (2)   Lot lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a lot
line, the lot line shall be considered the boundary line of the district.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)
§ 1242.04 ANNEXED LAND.
   Any property annexed to the city shall be classified as R-1 Single-Family
Residence District upon annexation and shall be subject to the requirements of
the R-1 Single-Family Residence District, unless otherwise provided for in the
annexation agreement or until the territory is rezoned.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)
§ 1242.05 USE OF LAND AND BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Number of buildings on a lot. In the R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Districts,
no more than one principal building may be located on a single lot. In all
other districts, more than one principal building may be located on a lot
provided that each building complies with the applicable requirements of
Chapter 1246 (Zoning District Regulations) as though it were a principal
building on an individual lot.
   (B)   Applicability of district regulations.
      (1)   Applicability of use regulations. No building, structure, or land
shall be utilized for any use other than a use allowed as either a permitted or
special use in the zoning district in which such building, structure, or land
is located. Buildings, structures, or land may also be used for a temporary use
or an accessory use in accordance with the requirements of §
1244.04 (Accessory Structures and Uses) and §
1244.05 (Temporary Structures and Uses).
      (2)   Applicability of lot and setback regulations. No lot or setback
shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements of this
Code. Lots or setbacks created after the effective date hereof shall meet the
minimum requirements established by this Code. All setbacks allocated to a
building shall be located on the same zoning lot as such building.
      (3)   Applicability of bulk and height regulations. All buildings and
structures erected after the effective date of this Code shall meet the bulk
and height requirements for the zoning district in which the structure is
located. No existing structure shall be enlarged, altered, reconstructed, or
relocated in such a manner that conflicts with the requirements of the zoning
district in which the structure shall be located.
   (C)   Visibility obstruction. Nothing in any residential district shall be
erected, placed, or allowed to grow in a manner that will create a visibility
obstruction for motorists, bicyclists, or pedestrians.
      (1)   Visibility obstructions at intersecting streets. No building,
structure, or landscape element shall exceed three feet in height within the
sight triangle area formed by 25 feet of the intersecting streets measured
along the curb line, or edge of pavement where no curbs are present (see Figure
1242.05-A. Visibility Obstruction at Intersecting Streets).
      (2)   Visibility obstructions at driveways. No building, structure, sign,
or landscape element shall obstruct the area within the sight triangle, between
three feet and seven feet in height, on either side of any driveway. Beginning
at the intersection of the lot line with the driveway, the sight triangle shall
be formed by measuring ten feet along the lot line in the opposite direction of
the driveway and ten feet along the driveway in the opposite direction of the
lot line, then connecting the endpoints of the lines across the subject
property (see Figure
1242.05-B. Visibility at Driveways).

within the designated district provided that it meets all applicable use
standards set forth in §

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure an appropriate
quantity of vehicular and bicycle parking to support a variety of land uses and
transportation modes, and provide for adequate site access and loading
facilities.
   (B)   Applicability. The requirements of this chapter shall apply to the
following:
      (1)   New developments.
      (2)   Planned developments.
      (3)   Alteration of an existing principal or accessory structure or a
change in use that results in an increase in the number of required parking
spaces.
      (4)   The construction of new parking facilities, loading facilities,
drive-throughs, and/or driveways.
      (5)   The reconfiguration, expansion, or reconstruction of an existing
parking lot that results in a total of 15 spaces or more.
   (C)   General requirements. The following requirements apply to all parking
and loading areas.
      (1)   Site plan approval. Site plan review approval is required prior to
either the construction of a new parking lot or drive-through, or the expansion
of an existing parking lot that results in a total of 15 spaces or more (see §
1252.03(B) (Site Plan Review)).
      (2)   Occupancy permit. Off-street parking lots and loading areas
required by this chapter shall be completed prior to the issuance of an
occupancy permit for the uses served by the parking lots and loading areas.
      (3)   Change in use. When an existing use is changed to a new use,
parking and loading spaces shall be provided as required for the new use.
Additional parking and/or loading spaces shall be required in the amount by
which the requirements for the new use exceed the existing number of parking
spaces. If the number of existing parking spaces is greater than the number of
spaces required for the new use, the number of parking spaces may be decreased
to meet the minimum requirement for the new use.
      (4)   Materials. All off-street parking lots, loading areas, and
driveways shall be constructed using a hard surface, all-weather, dustless
material. Semi-pervious materials and permeable pavements may also be used,
subject to the prior written approval of the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Encroachment. Parking lots are allowed to encroach into the
required interior side and/or rear yard but shall not be less than one foot
from the interior side lot line, provided no buffer yard is required, in
accordance with §
1250.06 (Buffer Yards).
      (6)   Maintenance responsibility. All parking and loading areas shall be
maintained and kept in good repair by the owner of record.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)
§ 1248.02 REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   (A)   General requirements. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in
accordance with the following standards.
      (1)   Availability of spaces. All parking spaces approved as part of the
issuance of an occupancy permit shall be made available to the residents,
customers, employees, guests, and/or other users of the principal use. Spaces
shall not be utilized for long-term storage or display of vehicles, materials,
or goods, unless otherwise stated in this Code.
      (2)   Commercial vehicles in residential areas. Medium and heavy-duty
commercial vehicles and trucks with flatbeds or trailers are not permitted to
park on lots in the R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Districts.
      (3)   Accessible parking.
         (a)   State requirement. Accessible parking spaces shall be designed
and provided as required by the Illinois Accessibility Code, as amended from
time to time, and all additional applicable laws.
         (b)   Applicability. Accessible parking shall be provided for all off-
street parking lots that provide parking for employees, visitors, or both, with
the exception of single-family, two-family, and townhouse dwellings.
         (c)   Minimum parking requirements. The number of accessible parking
spaces may be counted toward the total number of off-street parking spaces
required. In the event of a conflict between this section and any applicable
state law or regulation, the provision requiring the greatest number of
accessible parking spaces shall control.
      (4)   Off-premises parking. Parking facilities for uses other than
single-family, two-family, and townhouse dwellings that are provided off-
premises shall be located within 600 feet of the building or use served, as
measured along a dedicated pedestrian path. Distances greater than 600 feet may
be permitted with Zoning Administrator approval.
      (5)   Tandem parking. Tandem parking is permitted with the approval of
the Zoning Administrator through the site plan review process (see §
1252.03(B) (Site Plan Review)).
   (B)   Computation. Off-street parking spaces shall be calculated using the
following standards.
      (1)   Units of measurement. The following shall be utilized to calculate
the number of required parking spaces.
         (a)   Gross floor area. Unless otherwise stated, parking standards for
non-residential uses shall be calculated on the basis of gross floor area (GFA)
in square feet.
         (b)   Occupancy- or capacity-based requirements. Parking spaces
required per seat, employee, student, or occupant shall be calculated based on
the maximum number of employees on the largest shift, maximum number of
students enrolled, or maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever measurement is
applicable.
         (c)   Bench seating. For uses in which patrons or spectators occupy
benches, pews, bleachers, or similar seating facilities, each 24 inches of such
seating shall be counted as one seat.
      (2)   Fractions. When computation of required parking spaces results in a
fractional number, a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded, and a
fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one parking space.
      (3)   Multiple uses on a lot. When there are multiple uses on a lot, the
amount of parking required shall be the sum of the parking requirements for
each individual use, unless the use qualifies for shared parking or other
parking reductions as established in §
1248.03 (Parking Reductions).
      (4)   Use of off-street loading area. Area allocated to any off-street
loading spaces shall not be used to satisfy parking space requirements or

§ 1248.03 PARKING REDUCTIONS.
   (A)   Parking reductions. The off-street parking requirements established in
Table 1248.02-B. Off-Street Parking Requirements may be reduced by the
following measures, as applicable.
      (1)   On-street parking spaces. On-street parking spaces that are located
directly adjacent to the front and/or corner side lot line or within 125 feet
of said lot line may count towards the off-street parking requirement for a
non-residential use. On-street spaces must be located along the same side of
the street as the property and a minimum of 50% of the parking space must fall
within 125 feet of the lot line. Where on-street parking spaces are unmarked,
the number of spaces shall be calculated by dividing the linear feet of the on-
street parking area adjacent to the lot line by 22.
      (2)   Proximity to a transit station. Uses that are located within 600
feet of a commuter rail station or bus stop, as measured from any point along
the lot line, may reduce the total number of required off-street parking spaces
by 15%.
      (3)   Proximity to a municipal parking lot. In the C-2 District along
Cermak Road only, developments that are located within 400 feet of a municipal
parking lot, as measured from any point along the lot line, may reduce the
total number of off-street parking spaces required for nonresidential uses by
15%.
      (4)   Shared parking. For multiple uses that share a parking lot, a
reduction of up to 25% of the total required off-street parking spaces may be
granted by the Zoning Administrator through site plan review. Applicants must
demonstrate that uses have different peak demand for parking (weekday, weekend,
or evening hours). A shared parking agreement between uses must be filed with
the city and approved by the City Attorney. Any subsequent change in ownership
or use shall meet the minimum parking requirements established by this chapter
or arrange a new shared parking agreement.
      (5)   Fee-in-lieu. A property in the C-2 or C-3 District may satisfy any
off-street parking requirement for a non-residential use through payment of a
fee-in-lieu of providing parking spaces, subject to approval by the Zoning,
Planning, and Development Commission and in conformance with the following
standards.
         (a)   Approval required. The Zoning, Planning, and Development
Commission may approve or deny any application for fee-in-lieu based on the
following criteria:
            1.   Approval will facilitate new development or redevelopment of
property within the C-2 or C-3 District.
            2.   Approval will facilitate a pedestrian-oriented environment.
            3.   Approval will relieve constraints in providing the required
parking due to lot size and configuration.
            4.   The property has adequate access to public parking spaces and
public transportation, or future opportunities exist to provide public parking
in the area.
         (b)   Dedicated parking fund. The fee required shall be based upon a
uniform fee per parking space established annually by the Zoning, Planning, and
Development Commission. Such payment shall be placed into a dedicated parking
fund to be used by the city for the acquisition, construction, and maintenance
of public off-street parking lots within the same general area as the property
for which the fee was collected.
         (c)   Certificate of waiver. Evidence of the issuance of a parking
waiver shall be in the form of a certificate of waiver, recorded with the Cook
County Recorder of Deeds at the property owner's expense and issued in the name
of the property owner to which the waiver is granted. Full payment shall be
made in advance to the dedicated parking fund as a condition of the certificate
of waiver issued by the city and prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
         (d)   Applicability of certificate. The certificate of waiver shall be
applicable only to the structure and use for which it is issued. New
development or additions, or any construction that results in additional square
footage or an increased number of dwelling units, shall be required to comply
with the parking requirements for said additions or obtain another waiver.
(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)
§ 1248.04 BICYCLE PARKING.
   (A)   Applicability. When off-street parking lots are provided for new
construction, bicycle parking shall be provided as established in Table
1248.04-A. Bicycle Parking Requirements.
   (B)   Computation. When the bicycle parking requirement established in Table
1248.04-A. Bicycle Parking Requirements is based on the number of vehicle
spaces, the total number of bicycle spaces required shall be based on the total
number of vehicular spaces required as established in Table 1248.02-B. Off-
Street Parking Requirements, absent any parking reductions permitted in §
1248.03 (Parking Reductions).
   (C)   Parking exemptions. Certain uses in Table 1248.04-A allow a minimum
threshold below which no parking is required (for example, personal services
establishments under 7,500 square feet are not required to provide parking).
Uses that have a total gross floor area above the minimum threshold may
subtract the exemption from the total gross floor area to calculate the minimum
parking requirement.
   (D)   Minimum requirement. Where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of
two spaces shall be provided.
   (E)   Location. Bicycle parking shall be located on the same zoning lot as
the use served, unless the Zoning Administrator approves its location in the
public right-of-way. With Zoning Administrator approval, existing bicycle
parking spaces located within the public right-of-way and directly adjacent to
the lot may be counted toward the bicycle parking requirement. Bicycle parking
for multi-family dwelling uses may be provided in secure common areas for
residents such as garages or storage rooms.
   (F)   Design.
      (1)   Dimensions. Each bicycle parking space shall have a minimum width
of two feet, minimum length of six feet, and minimum vertical clearance of
seven feet.
      (2)   Access. An aisle with a minimum width of five feet shall be
provided behind bicycle parking facilities to ensure adequate maneuvering
space.
      (3)   Racks and structures. Secure racks and supporting structures shall
be provided for each unprotected bicycle parking space, and shall be designed
to accommodate both chain and U-shaped locking devices.
      (4)   Parking areas. Areas used for bicycle parking shall be designed and
maintained to be reasonably free from standing water, mud, and dust, and shall
be well-lit.
      (5)   Signage. If bicycle parking required for nonresidential uses is not
visible from the street, signage shall be posted to indicate the location of
such parking.

   (B)   Vertical clearance. Each parking space shall have a minimum vertical
clearance of seven feet.
   (C)   Access.
      (1)   Vehicular access to parking lots. Parking lots shall be designed
with adequate means of vehicular access from a driveway, street, or alley in a
manner that minimizes interference with traffic movement.
      (2)   Vehicular access to parking spaces. Each parking space within a
parking lot shall open directly into an aisle or driveway of sufficient width
to provide adequate means of vehicular access to the parking space.
   (D)   Striping. Off-street parking lots shall delineate parking spaces with
paint or another permanent, durable material, which shall be maintained in
order to remain clearly visible.
   (E)   Snow storage.
      (1)   Provision for snow storage. Snow storage areas shall be provided on
or adjacent to all off-street parking areas subject to the standards of this
section to ensure public safety and accommodate transportation.
      (2)   Obstructions. Snow shall be stored in a manner that does not
restrict access, circulation, or sight lines for pedestrians or vehicles at
driveways, sidewalks, or other access points. Required off-street parking
spaces, driveways, access aisles, and walkways shall not be used for the
purpose of snow storage.
      (3)   Storage in landscape areas. Landscape areas shall not be used for
snow storage unless designed for that use, with non-compacted soils, adequate
area to accommodate snow piles and containing plantings selected for salt-
tolerance and durability.
      (4)   Storage in stormwater facilities. Snow shall not be stored on top
of storm drain catch basins or stormwater management facilities, as plowed snow
can contain pollutants and debris that accumulate in the area and block the
system, causing localized flooding.
      (5)   Off-site snow storage. If appropriate snow storage cannot be
accommodated on-site, snow shall be stored off-site, with information on this
arrangement submitted to the Zoning Administrator with sufficient detail to
ensure adequate safety and parking facilities during snow events.
   (F)   Wheel stops. Bumper stops, wheel stops, or curbing shall be
permanently and securely installed along the perimeter of the parking lot to
prevent vehicle overhang from encroaching on sidewalks, landscape areas,
fencing, walls, or buildings.
   (G)   Landscape requirements. Parking areas shall meet the applicable
requirements of
Chapter 1250 (Landscape Standards).
   (H)   Drainage. Off-street parking lots shall be graded for proper drainage
and meet the stormwater management requirements of §
1250.03 (Stormwater Management).
   (I)   Lighting. Parking lots shall be illuminated in accordance with the
standards of §
1250.08 (Outdoor Lighting).
(Ord. 17-31, passed 9-12-2017)
§ 1248.06 LOADING FACILITY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. Manufacturing, commercial, civic, institutional, and
multi-family dwelling uses shall provide off-street loading spaces as
established in Table 1248.06-A. Loading Requirements. The Zoning Administrator
may approve a reduction in the minimum loading requirements, or approval for
shared use of loading spaces for multiple users, through the site plan review
process (see §
1252.03(B) (Site Plan Review)).
   (B)   Computation. Off-street loading spaces shall be calculated on the
basis of gross floor area (GFA) in square feet.
      (1)   Fractions of loading spaces. When computation of required loading
spaces results in a fraction, any fraction of less than one-half shall be
disregarded, and any fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one
loading space.
      (2)   Maximum number required. The maximum number of loading spaces
required of a development shall be four spaces.
   (C)   Dimensions. All required loading spaces shall have a minimum width of
ten feet, minimum length of 26 feet, and minimum vertical clearance of 14 feet.
   (D)   Location. All loading spaces shall be located on the same zoning lot
as the use served, unless an alternate location has been approved by the Zoning
Administrator through the site plan review process (see §
1252.03(B) (Site Plan Review)).
      (1)   Interior side or rear facade. Loading facilities shall be located
on the interior side and/or rear facade of the building and shall not project
into any required yards.
      (2)   Drive aisle. With prior written Zoning Administrator approval, a
designated loading area may be located within a drive aisle.
      (3)   Residential districts. No loading space shall be closer than 50
feet to any property in the R-1, R-2, R-3, or R-4 District unless the space is
screened by a solid fence or wall with a minimum of six feet in height.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street loading space shall have appropriate
means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner that will least
interfere with traffic movement. No loading space shall project into or block a
street, alley, access drive, or parking area.
   (F)   Materials. Off-street loading areas shall be paved with a hard
surface, all-weather dustless material. Semi-pervious materials and permeable
pavements may also be used, subject to the approval of the Zoning
Administrator.

   (A)   Space requirements. Each drive-through facility shall provide a
minimum of two stacking spaces per bay, with the exception that restaurant uses
shall provide a minimum of four stacking spaces per drive-through lane. Refer
to Figure 1248.07-A. Stacking Spaces.
   (B)   Dimensions. All stacking spaces shall have a minimum width of nine
feet, as measured from the outermost point of any service window to the edge of
the drive-through lane, and minimum length of 18 feet.
   (C)   Location. Stacking spaces shall be located behind the vehicle parked
at the last point of service, such as a drive-through window or car wash bay,
and shall be placed in a line within the drive-through lane. Stacking spaces
shall be located so that they do not obstruct ingress or egress to the site or
to required parking and loading spaces, or encroach onto the public right-of-
way. The vehicle space directly adjacent to the last point of service (such as
the space next to a drive-through window) shall not count towards the total
stacking space requirement.
   (D)   Bail out lane. Drive-through lanes shall include a bailout lane, which
shall run parallel to the drive-through lane, have a minimum width of ten feet,
and provide unobstructed exit capability to all vehicles that have entered the

stormwater management controls due to lot size and configuration.
         (b)   Dedicated stormwater management fund. The fee required shall be
based upon a calculation made by the Department of Public Works for
construction and ongoing maintenance of the required on-site controls. Such
payment shall be placed into a dedicated stormwater management fund to be used
by the city for the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of stormwater
management controls within the same general area as the property for which the
fee was collected.
         (c)   Certificate of waiver. Evidence of the issuance of a stormwater
management controls waiver shall be in the form of a certificate of waiver,
recorded with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds at the property owner's expense
and issued in the name of the property owner to which the waiver is granted.
Full payment shall be made in advance to the dedicated stormwater management
fund as a condition of the certificate of waiver issued by the city and prior
to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
         (d)   Applicability of certificate. The certificate of waiver shall be
applicable only for the limits of the development for which it is issued. New
development or additions, or any construction that results in applicability of
this section, shall be required to comply with the parking requirements for

      (5)   Operations and maintenance plan. Maintenance of stormwater
management facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility
of the property owner. An operations and maintenance plan (O&M plan) must be
signed by the owner and notarized, and submitted to the city. A copy of the O&M
plan must be provided to each new owner before the sale is finalized, and the
O&M plan must be signed by the new owner, notarized, and submitted to the city
to be kept on record. The O&M plan shall include the following:
         (a)   Maintenance easement. Prior to approval of a stormwater
management plan, the applicant must execute a maintenance easement agreement
that shall be binding on all subsequent landowners served by the stormwater
management facility. The easement shall provide for access to the facility at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city to ensure that the
facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and
any other provisions established by this chapter. The easement shall be
recorded by the grantor with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds after approval
by the city.
         (b)   Maintenance after construction. The owner or operator of
permanent stormwater management facilities installed in accordance with this
chapter shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of such
facilities to achieve the goals of this chapter. Proper operation and
maintenance shall include, at a minimum, the following:
            1.   A preventative/corrective maintenance program for all critical
facilities and systems of treatment and control (or related appurtenances)
which are installed or used by the owner or operator to achieve the goals of
this chapter.
            2.   Written procedures for training personnel in the operation and
maintenance of the facilities.

application and the approved construction documents for which the permit has
been issued and any approved amendments to the approved application or the
approved construction documents.
   (D)   Compliance by homeowners; additional inspections.  All building

shall be occupied or used, in whole or in part, for any purpose until a

   (D)   Temporary certificates. Pending the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued pending the
completion of the construction authorized by the permit. The temporary
certificate of occupancy shall not be construed as in any way altering the
respective rights, duties or obligations of the owners or the city relating to
the use or occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by this
Building Code. The temporary certificate of occupancy shall not be issued,
except under restrictions and provisions as will adequately ensure the safety
of the occupants. No temporary certificate of occupancy shall be issued if,

§ 1443.05 DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   (A)   In general. A demolition permit is required for the demolition of any
structure, building or alteration, which would require a building permit. No
principal building or structure shall be issued a demolition permit unless the
request is approved by express action of the City Council.

Council pursuant to division (A), all demolition permit applications shall be
forwarded by the Building Director to the Berwyn Historic Preservation
Commission (the “Commission”) within five business days of receipt of the
application. The Commission shall, within 15 business days of receipt of the
application or by the Commission’s next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever
occurs first, make a preliminary determination of historic eligibility pursuant
to the criteria set forth for historic landmarks and Historic Districts in §
1478.05 and/or §
1478.06, respectively.
      (2)   In the event that the Commission determines that a structure,
building or alteration is not eligible for designation as a historic landmark
or included within a Historic District, all as defined in §
1478.03 respectively, the Commission may deliver a resolution to the Building
Director within five business days of its preliminary determination stating
that the Commission has no objection to the demolition permit application.
      (3)   In the event that the Commission determines that a structure,
building or alteration is eligible to be designated as a historic landmark or
included within a Historic District, all as defined in §
1478.03 respectively, the Commission may deliver a resolution to the Building
Director within five days of its preliminary determination recommending the
City Council stay the demolition permit application until the Commission
completes its historic landmark or Historic District nomination procedures
pursuant to
Chapter 1478 of the code.
      (4)   In the event that the Building Director receives a resolution from
the Commission pursuant to this section, the Building Director shall forward
the resolution to the City Council for final determination of the demolition
permit application at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting. City
Council shall consider the resolutions in making their final determinations
upon a demolition permit application.
      (5)   lf the Building Director does not receive a resolution from the
Commission within the time period provided in division (A)(1) above, the
Commission will be deemed to have recommended approval of the demolition
permit.
   (B)   Notice to utilities; disconnection of services and equipment. Before a
structure is demolished or removed, the owner or his or her agent shall notify
all utilities having service connections within the structure, such as water,
electric, gas and sewer, of the pending demolition. A demolition permit to
demolish or remove a structure shall not be issued until a release is obtained
from the utilities, stating that their respective service connections and
appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators, have been removed or
sealed and plugged in a safe manner.
   (C)   Notice to adjoining owners. Only when written notice has been given by
the applicant to the owners of adjoining lots, and to the owners of wired or
other facilities, of which the temporary removal is necessitated by the
proposed work, shall a demolition permit request for the removal of a principal
building or structure be reviewed by the City Council for approval. The notice
shall include the time, place and date of City Council review.
   (D)   Maintenance of unsafe or hazardous conditions. When, in the opinion of
Building Director, a principal structure is in an unsafe or hazardous
condition, the provisions of City Council action, as well as the provisions
under division (A)(1) herein, may be waived in order to protect against
imminent danger. Whenever a structure is demolished or removed, the premises
shall be maintained free from all unsafe or hazardous conditions by the proper
regulation of the lot and restoration of established grades.

permit upon a showing that the delay was not dilatory and that there was
reasonable cause for the delay. The Director may waive the repayment of permit

that there was reasonable cause for the delay and that the delay was beyond the
control of the permit holder.
   (D)   Revocation of permit or approval.  The Director shall revoke a permit
or approval issued under the provisions of this Building Code when a false
statement or misrepresentation of fact is made in the application or on the

based, and, in the opinion of the Director, the statement(s) or
misrepresentation(s) are of a nature as to endanger the public health, safety
or welfare.
      (2)   The Director shall revoke a temporary certificate of occupancy
issued under the provisions of this Building Code when the Director has
reasonable grounds to believe that, in the opinion of the Director,
construction being done under the building permit has been done in a way as to
endanger the public health, safety or welfare.
   (H)   Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the Director that work on any
building or structure is being prosecuted contrary to the provisions of this

§ 1478.04 CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC LANDMARKS AND INTERIOR HISTORIC
LANDMARKS.
   (A)   The Commission, in determining whether to recommend for designation,
and the City Council, in determining whether to approve designation of
particular sites, structures or improvements as historic landmarks, shall
consider the following criteria:
Historical And/or Cultural Importance
    Significance as an example of the architectural, cultural, economic,
    historic or social development or heritage of the city, the state or the
(1) United States. "Significance" means the relative importance of the property
    when viewed in the property's architectural, cultural, economic, historic
    or social context.
    Location as a site of a historic event, with a significant effect on the
(2) city, the state or the United States. "Significant" means the relative
    importance of the effect of the event on the city, the state or the United
    States.
    Identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to
(3) the architectural, cultural, economic, historic or social heritage, or
    other aspect of the city, the state or the United States
(4) Existence in the National Register of Historic Places
    Embodiment of those distinguishing characteristics of significant
(5) architectural type, or style, or engineering specimen. "Significant" means
    the relative importance of the architectural type, or style, or engineering
    specimen.
    Identification as the work of a builder, designer, architect, craftsperson,
    engineer or landscape architect who individual work is significant in the
(6) development of the city, the state or the United States. "Significant"
    means the relative importance of the builder, designer, architect,
    craftsperson. engineer or landscape architect.
    Contains design elements, detail, material or craftsmanship that make the
(7) property or building structurally or architecturally innovative, rare or
    unique
    Representation of an architectural, cultural, economic, historic or social
(8) theme, style or period, expressed in distinctive areas, districts, places,
    buildings or structures that may or may not be contiguous
 
   (B)   Principles for evaluating the historical and/or cultural importance of
proposed historic landmarks by the Commission. The Commission, in evaluating
all properties for designation as historic landmarks pursuant to any of the
criteria above, should apply and be guided by the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation, effective
September 29, 1983 and revised from time to time thereafter, which are prepared
under the authority of sections 101(f), (g), and (h), and section 110 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, including, but not
limited to, the following principles:
      (1)   Evaluation requires adequately developed historic contexts,
including sufficient information about the appearance, condition and
associative values of the property to be evaluated in order to classify it as
to property type; compare its features or characteristics with those expected
for its property type; and define the physical extent of the property and
accurately locate the property.
      (2)   Evaluation must distinguish between facts and analysis, and must
include identification and description of pertinent historical contexts;
description of the property and its significance in the historical context; and
analysis of the integrity of the property relative to that needed to represent
the context.
      (3)   Where the Commission deems it necessary and feasible, Commissioners
should consult with other individuals experienced in applying the relevant
criteria; for example, the State Historic Preservation Officer.
      (4)   Evaluation should not be undertaken using documentation that may be
out of date. Prior to proceeding with evaluation the current condition of the
property should be determined and previous analyses evaluated in light of any
new information.
      (5)   If the Commission determines that it does not have all the
information it needs to conduct an adequate evaluation, it may undertake its
own research in order to supplement the nomination to the extent necessary. In
cases in which needed information is not obtainable, for example, where
historical records have been destroyed, the Commission should acknowledge what
information was not obtainable and how that missing information may affect the
reliability of the evaluation.
   (C)   Integrity.
      (1)   In order for the Commission to nominate any site, structure or
improvement that meets one or more of the above criteria as a historic
landmark, the Commission must additionally determine that it has sufficient
integrity of location, design, material and workmanship to make it worthy of
preservation or restoration.
      (2)   "Integrity" means the authenticity of a property's historic
identity, evidenced by the survival of physical characteristics that existed
during the property's historic period.
      (3)   The integrity of the property in its current condition, rather than
its likely condition after a proposed treatment, should be evaluated. Factors
such as structural problems, deterioration, or abandonment should be considered
in the evaluation only if they have affected the integrity of the significant
features or characteristics of the property.
   (D)   All properties must be designated by ordinance upon the approval of
the City Council in order to be deemed local historic landmarks.

Administration Department of the Commission’s receipt of the nomination and
shall deliver copies of same to the City Clerk’s office and Code Administration
as soon thereafter as is possible and shall make a preliminary determination of
eligibility within 15 days of the receipt of the nomination, or by the
Commission’s next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever occurs later. A
determination by the Commission of preliminary eligibility must be based upon
or finding(s) by the Commission that there is a likelihood that a nominated
historic landmark will meet one or more of the criteria for designation set
forth in §
1478.04 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a majority of the Commission members determines that there is
not likelihood that the nominated historic landmark may meet at least one of

and so notify the party making the nomination, in writing. A denial shall be
the final administrative decision. The Commission may not reconsider the
preliminary eligibility of a historic landmark for at least one year following
the submission of the original nomination and then only upon further evidence
of qualification. The Commission may waive the one-year period if the
Commission deems that such action is warranted due to new circumstances or new
evidence of eligibility.
      (3)   If a preliminary determination is made that there is a likelihood
that the nominated historic landmark may meet one or more criteria, the
Commission shall schedule a designation hearing(s) to be held within 45 days of
the preliminary determination and shall send the owner of record written notice
of same no less than 15 days in advance of a hearing by regular and certified
mail or via some other delivery service that documents receipt, properly
addressed to the owner of record as shown in the records of the Recorder of
Deeds or Registrar of Titles, whichever is appropriate, and with sufficient
postage affixed thereto. If the nominating party is the owner of record, the
Commission shall schedule the designation hearing to take place at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. Failure to receive notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings of the Commission.

and a brief statement of the reasons therefor. The form shall provide a return
address for the Commission and shall direct the owner to return the completed
form to the Commission no less than seven days prior to the scheduled hearing.
The form shall further indicate that the owner’s failure to respond shall be
presumed by the Commission to indicate the owner’s support for the proposed
designation. The owner may rebut this presumption by appearing at the hearing
and testifying in opposition to the proposed designation. The Commission shall
make every reasonable effort to contact personally or by telephone owner(s) of
record who have not returned an executed owner(s) form to explain the
designation process and to encourage the return of the signed form.
   (B)   At the hearing the Commission shall take testimony and receive
evidence from the nominators, owner(s) of records, and any other interested
parties who wish to be heard and/or present evidence on the application of the
criteria for designation, set forth herein above in §
1478.04, to the proposed historic landmark. The Commission shall hear testimony
and receive evidence in accordance with the procedural rules as the Commission

§ 1478.07 DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC LANDMARKS AND INTERIOR HISTORIC LANDMARKS.
   (A)   Within 45 days following completion of the public hearing(s), the

affirmative vote of a majority of the full Commission to recommend designation
to the City Council. The resolution shall be accompanied by a written report
summarizing the evidence presented at the hearing, setting forth findings of
fact based thereon, and explaining the basis for the Commission’s
recommendation. A decision by the Commission not to recommend designation is

zoning action on the long range preservation of these resources. In its review,
the Commission shall also consider the criteria specified in §
1478.13 of this chapter.
   (C)   In no event shall the provisions of this section preclude the
necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness or a certificate of
economic hardship when required under these Codified Ordinances.
   (D)   In the case of the alteration, demolition or removal of an eligible
historic landmark, the building or demolition permit shall be issued or the
alteration authorized upon the denial of designation of historic landmark
status by the City Council; provided, however, that if the site, building,

§ 1478.13 REVIEW CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS AND CERTIFICATE OF
ADVISORY REVIEW.
   (A)   Guidelines for construction, alteration and relocation work.  In
making a determination to issue or deny a certificate of appropriateness for
construction, alteration or relocation work affecting an eligible or designated
historic landmark, or a determination to conduct an advisory review and either
approve or make recommendations with regard to construction or relocation work
on property located in a designated Historic District, either the Commission or
the City Council, when considering an appeal, shall consider the effect of the
proposed construction, alteration or relocation on the architectural features
and on the historic, aesthetic or architectural value, characteristics and
significance of the eligible or designated historic landmark or designated
Historic District.
   (B)   Determination. In making a determination whether to issue a
certificate of appropriateness or a certificate of advisory review, the
Commission or the City Council when considering an appeal, shall follow the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, revised 1990, as amended, and other
criteria and guidelines as the Commission may recommend, and which the City
Council may adopt, for use by the Commission or the City Council when
considering an appeal. The criteria shall include but are not limited to the
following:
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment;
      (2)   The significant original qualities and/or historic character of a
property shall be retained and preserved. The removal or alteration of historic
or distinctive architectural materials or features and spaces that characterize
a property shall be avoided;
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken;
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved;
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterizes a historic property shall be
preserved;
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of
distinctive features, the new feature shall match the old in design, inherent
and not renewable color, texture and other visual qualities and materials.
Materials where possible replacement of missing features shall be substantiated
by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence;
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible;
      (8)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If the resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;
      (9)   The historic and architectural integrity of the property and its
environment shall be protected by making the new work compatible with the
existing structures, surrounding structures, streetscape or the character of
the Historic District, whenever one or more of these elements is affected by
the work, with respect to the following design criteria:
         (a)   The height of the alteration, addition or construction;
         (b)   Proportions between the width and heights of structure’s front
facade;
         (c)   The proportions and relationships between doors and windows;
         (d)   Relationship of building masses and the open space around them;
         (e)   The design of the roof shapes, forms and materials;
         (f)   Landscaping and appurtenances, which should also be sensitive to
the individual structure, its occupants and their needs;
         (g)   The scale of the proposed structure;
         (h)   Dominant horizontal or vertical directional expression of front
elevation or additional elevation; and
         (i)   Architectural style, design, details and materials, including
textures and patterns but not necessarily color.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (C)   Guidelines for removal or demolition of historic landmarks, or
buildings, structures or improvements located within a Historic District.
Guidelines to be used by the Commission, or by the City Council when
considering an appeal, in making a determination of appropriateness of the
removal or demolition of a landmark or a building, structure or improvement in
a Historic District shall include but not be limited to the guidelines set
forth in division (A) hereinabove. Certificates of appropriateness for the
removal or demolition of a building, structure or improvement in a Historic
District shall be granted by the referenced criteria, if the proposal is for
the removal or demolition of a noncontributing resource.
(Ord. 06-50, passed 11-28-2006; Ord. 11-04, passed 1-25-2011; Ord. 11-19,
passed 4-26-2011)
§ 1478.14 PROCEDURES FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Preapplication. Any owner of a historic landmark may, at any time,
request the Commission to make a preliminary review of proposed work in order
to determine whether the proposed work will meet the criteria set forth herein.
The Commission may, on a basis of documents and other materials presented, make
a preliminary finding of acceptability, which may then be used by the
Commission to expedite the processing of a certificate of appropriateness after
the owner has applied for a building permit and/or a certificate of
appropriateness. The Commission will issue the certificate of appropriateness
only if the work described on the permit documents submitted by the owner to
obtain the permit is found to be substantially the same as that which was
preapproved. If, during the preapplication review, the Commission finds that
the proposed work does not meet the criteria, the Commission may advise the
owner on possible ways to meet the criteria.
   (B)   Application. Any application for a building permit and/or Certificate
of Appropriateness for construction, alteration or relocation affecting an
eligible or historical landmark or the removal of a building, structure or
improvement from a property within a designated Historic District, and any
application for a demolition permit for the demolition of an eligible or
designated historic landmark or for the demolition of a building, structure or
improvement in a designated Historic District shall be sent by the City Clerk,
within three working days of receipt, to the Commission. At the time of receipt
of the application(s), the City Clerk shall issue to the applicant a historic
preservation guidelines pamphlet prepared by or made available by the
Commission, which summarizes the preservation requirements and preservation
assistance available in the city with regard to the historic landmarks and
Historic Districts. The Building Director shall not issue a building permit or
shall not authorize the issuance of a permit or any alternations until a
certificate of appropriateness or certificate of economic hardship has been
issued.
   (C)   Subcommittee and Commission staff review and issuance of certificate
of appropriateness. 
      (1)   The Commission may propose and the City Council may adopt rules,
procedures and criteria under which a Subcommittee of the Commission and/or
Commission staff may approve applications for certificates of appropriateness
when the proposed work involves:
         (a)   Restoration to original conditions;
         (b)   No changes in materials;
         (c)   Changes not visible from the street; or
         (d)   Other types of activities determined by the Commission to have
limited effect on the historic, architectural or aesthetic qualities or
landmarks or districts.
      (2)   The rules, procedures and criteria, if adopted, shall provide that
the Subcommittee or Commission staff shall act within five working days from
receipt of the application by the Commission to review, approve and issue a
certificate of appropriateness, or to refer the application to the full
Commission for its consideration.
   (D)   Commission review.  If rules, procedures and criteria are adopted
providing for Subcommittee and/or staff issuance of certificates of
appropriateness under certain limited circumstances, applications which would
not meet the criteria for Subcommittee or staff review under division (C)
herein, shall be referred to the Commission by the Subcommittee or Commission
staff, or applications which have been denied a certificate of appropriateness
by Subcommittee or Commission staff shall be referred to the Commission. Except
as otherwise provided for in rules and procedures adopted in accordance with
division (C) herein, all applications for certificates of appropriateness shall
be referred directly to the full Commission for review. The Commission shall
review the completed application and supporting information within 30 days of
receiving same, either from a subcommittee or directly from the City Clerk. The
applicant shall be notified, in writing, of the date, time and place of the
meeting at which Commission review on the proposed work shall take place. The
applicant shall be requested to submit the plans; drawings, photographs or
other information the Commission may request to complete its review. Requested
information shall not delay the meeting. The notice shall be sent no less than
five days before the meeting at which the proposed work is to be reviewed. The
applicant may waive the requirement for this five-day advance notice, in
writing. A special meeting of the Commission may be called if the application
is received more than 15 days before the Commission’s next scheduled meeting. A
final vote, as to approval or denial, shall be made within 45 days of the
receipt of a complete application.
   (E)   Acceptance of proposed work and issuance of certificate of
appropriateness. If, upon review, a majority of the Commission finds the
proposed work is in accordance with the applicable criteria set forth in §
1478.13 herein and the purposes of this chapter, it may issue a certificate of
appropriateness. The resolution issuing a certificate of appropriateness shall
be sent to the applicant, the City Clerk, and the Building Department within
five working days after the decision. A certificate of appropriateness shall
expire one year after the date of issuance. Any change in the proposed work
after issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall require inspection by
Historic Preservation staff to determine whether the work is still in
substantial compliance with the certificate of appropriateness. If staff
determines that the change in work is not in substantial compliance with the
certificate of appropriateness, then the owner must submit a revised
application to the Commission for review.
   (F)   Failure to issue a certificate of appropriateness. 
      (1)   If the Commission finds that the proposed work does not meet the
established criteria and, therefore, will adversely affect or destroy any
significant historic, aesthetic or architectural feature or value of an
eligible or designated historic landmark, or is inappropriate or inconsistent
with the spirit and purposes of the chapter, it shall not take action on the
application and shall so advise the applicant, the City Clerk and the Building
Department, in writing, within five working days of the determination not to
act on the application and shall further indicate to the applicant at that time
that the applicant may submit an amended application for expedited review or
may request a public hearing.
      (2)   Within the same five-working-day time frame, the Commission shall
send a letter to the applicant explaining any changes recommended by the
Commission before an amended application may be considered. The letter will
address the appropriate review criteria and other points deemed pertinent by
the Commission. The applicant may either amend the application or resubmit same
for expedited review, or the applicant may request a public hearing on the
application. If the applicant submits an amended application and it is
determined to conform to Commission recommendations, a certificate of
appropriateness may be issued by a majority of a quorum of the Commission.
   (G)   Public hearing following denial of a certificate of appropriateness.
Within 15 days of notice to the applicant to file an amended application or
request a public hearing, the applicant may request that the Commission hold a
public hearing where additional evidence and testimony may be heard regarding
the application for a certificate of appropriateness. The Commission shall hold
a public hearing within 45 days of receipt of the written request.
      (1)   Notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing
shall be sent by regular and certified mail to the applicant (see §
1478.08 to notify adjacent parties) and the notice shall also be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice shall be sent and
published not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the
hearing. The notice shall include the time and place of the hearing, a general
description of the contents of the request to be heard, and the address or
location of the property to which the request applies.
      (2)   At the public hearing, the Commission shall take testimony
presented by the applicant and any other interested parties concerning the
effect of the proposed alteration, construction, relocation, removal or
demolition upon an eligible or designated historic landmark, or the effect of
the proposed removal or demolition of any structure, building or improvement
with a Historic District upon the district, and shall conduct the hearings in a
manner consistent with the Rules of Procedure for Hearings Before the Historic
Preservation Commission adopted herein and made a part hereof and as may be
amended from time to time, by action of the Commission and the City Council.
The hearing may be continued to a date certain, with the concurrence of the
applicant.
      (3)   Within 15 days following the completion of the public hearing, the
Commission shall issue or deny the certificate of appropriateness. Notice of
the Commission’s decision will be sent to the applicant and owner, the City
Clerk and the Building Director within five working days of rendering the
decision. Notification procedures outline under §
1478.08 of this chapter will apply.
   (H)   Appeal to the City Council.  Upon denial of the application for a
certificate of appropriateness by the Commission, the applicant may appeal the
denial to the City Council or may request a certificate of economic hardship.
(Ord. 06-50, passed 11-28-2006; Ord. 11-19, passed 4-26-2011)
§ 1478.15 PROCEDURES FOR CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS.
   (A)   Application. Following denial of a certificate of appropriateness by
the Commission or by the City Council on appeal, the owner or designated
representative may apply for a certificate of economic hardship by submitting

   (B)   Public hearing process. 
      (1)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing within 45 days of

demolition upon the eligible or designated historic landmark or designated
Historic District based upon the criteria consistent with the Rules of
Procedure for Hearing Before the Historic Preservation Commission, as adopted
herein and made a part hereof and as may be amended, from time to time, by
action of the Commission and the City Council. The hearing may be continued to
a date certain. A record shall be kept of all proceedings.
   (C)   Factors. In determining where a certificate of economic hardship
should be issued, the factors to be considered by the Commission and the City
Council on the issue of economic hardship shall include but are not limited to
the following:
      (1)   A substantial decrease in the fair market value of the property as
a result of the denial of the certificate of appropriateness;
      (2)   A substantial decrease in the pre-tax or after-tax return to owners
of record or other investors in the property as a result of the denial of the
certificate of appropriateness;
      (3)   The cost of the proposed construction, alteration, relocation or
demolition, and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to
comply with the recommendations of the Commission for changes necessary for the
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness;
      (4)   The structural soundness of any structures on the property and
their suitability for rehabilitation; and
      (5)   The economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing
structure or improvement on the property in the case of a proposed demolition.
   (D)   Evidence.  The Commission may solicit expert testimony. The applicant
may be required to submit evidence at the hearing to support any of the
factors, including those listed above, which the applicant believes to have
contributed to the economic hardship, which the applicant alleges he or she
would suffer if the applicant were not granted a certificate of
appropriateness.
      (1)   Specific information and documentation, which should be presented
by the applicant as competent evidence at the hearing may include but not be
limited to the following:
         (a)    The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the
party from whom purchased (including description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased);
         (b)   The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon
according to the two most recent assessments;

         (g)   Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses
for the property;
         (h)   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income
from the property for the previous two years, itemized operating and

for a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield
a reasonable return to present or future owners.
      (2)   In the event that any of the required information is not reasonably
available to the applicant and cannot be obtained by the applicant, the
applicant shall provide to the Commission a statement of the information which
cannot be obtained and describe the reasons why the information cannot be
obtained.
   (E)   Issuance or denial of certificate of economic hardship.
      (1)   If the Commission finds that the owner and/or applicant has not
established that the owner and/or applicant will suffer a demonstrable economic
hardship as a result of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness, then
the Commission shall deny the application for certificate of economic hardship.
      (2)   If the Commission makes an initial determination that the applicant
has presented a case which may establish that without approval of the proposed
work all reasonable use of, or return from, a designated historic landmark will
be denied a property owner, but the Commission finds that reasonable
alternatives may exist which should be addressed by the applicant, then the
application shall be delayed for a period of no more than 30 days of this
period, the Commission shall investigate plans and make recommendations to the
owner and the City Council which are intended to provide for reasonable use of,
or return from the property, or to otherwise preserve the subject property.
During the second 30 days of this period, the applicant will investigate the
proposal of the Commission and prove the Commission with written response
thereto.
      (3)   If, at the end of this 60-day period, after reviewing its initial
finding and its subsequent proposals and the applicant’s response thereto, the
Commission finds that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot
be put to any reasonable use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic
hardship approving the proposed work. If the Commission finds otherwise, it
shall deny the application for a certificate of economic hardship. Within 15
days following the completion of the public hearing and within 15 days of the
60-day delay period provided for in this division, if applicable, the
Commission shall render its decision on the certificate of economic hardship by
adopting a resolution which shall set forth the findings of fact and decision
of the Commission either granting or denying the certificate of hardship.
      (4)   An executed copy of the resolution shall be sent to the applicant
and property owner, the City Clerk and the Building Department within five
working days after the decision.

notify the applicant and the affected departments of the city government.
   (D)   The decision of the City Council will be the final administrative
decision of the city.

§ 1478.17 RESERVED.
§ 1478.18 PREVENTION OF DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT.
   The Commission, on its own initiative, may file a petition with the Building
Department requesting that the Department proceed under the public safety and
housing ordinance to require correction of defects or repairs to eligible or
designated historic landmarks or building, structures or improvements in
designated Historic Districts so that the landmarks, buildings, structures or
improvements shall be preserved and protected in accordance with the purposes
of this chapter and the public safety and housing ordinance.
(Ord. 06-50, passed 11-28-2006)
§ 1478.19 HAZARDOUS STRUCTURES AND PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   (A)   This chapter shall not prohibit the demolition of any structure, which
poses an immediate hazard to human health and safety. When an eligible or
designated historic landmark or building, structure or improvement in a
designated Historic District requires immediate demolition due to its imminent
threat to human health and safety, and conditions have been reviewed by a
licensed architect or structural engineer and an authorized city official,
pursuant to ordinance, who have made the determination that the landmark,
building, structure or improvement should be demolished immediately, then
nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the demolition of such landmark,
building, structure or improvement. The city official ordering the demolition
shall, prior to causing the demolition, attempt notification of a designated
member of the Commission of the imminent threat posed by the landmarks,
building, structure or improvement if the notice may be given without
jeopardizing human health and safety. The Chairperson of the Commission shall
designate three members of the Commission, any of whom shall be authorized to
receive notice of emergency demolition as provided in this section.
   (B)   If the city has, pursuant to official action, declared a building,
structure or improvement that is an eligible or designated landmark or is
located in a designated Historic District as a public nuisance and has
authorized its demolition, the City Clerk or his or her designee shall have a
copy of the declaration of public nuisance delivered to the chairperson of the
Commission, who shall place the matter on the agenda of the next meeting of the
Commission. The Commission shall be authorized to review the building,
structure or improvement and determine if the owner or some other person can
commence rehabilitation of it immediately. The Commission shall ensure that
whoever will rehabilitate the building, structure or improvement, shall have
either public or private financing, or both, to make sure that the building,
structure or improvement is promptly rehabilitated in accordance with the
criteria set forth in this chapter. If the Commission is unable to secure the
rehabilitation plans of the building, structure or improvement within 90 days
of the date that the city obtains judicial authorization to demolish it,
whichever is later, then the city may proceed with the demolition of the
building, structure or improvement.

this chapter would not serve the public health, welfare, and safety and makes
written findings in support of any such decision.
   (B)   The notice will inform the owner that the Director will conduct a code
compliance inspection of the exterior of the vacant building to determine the
extent of compliance with the health, safety and welfare requirements of the
City Code. If the Director suspects a nuisance, safety hazard, or any
violations of the interior maintenance standards stated in this chapter during
the exterior inspection, he/she may order an inspection of the interior of the

shall be subject to an additional fine of $100 if the owner does not provide
access within 30 days of the receipt of the interior inspection notice. An
unpaid fee shall be a lien upon the premises. If the owner of the vacant
structure fails or refuses to consent to an inspection, the Director may seek
an administrative warrant from the circuit court of Cook County for the
purposes set forth in this chapter. The Mayor may require the owner to appear

§ 1484.02 PURPOSE; INTENT.
    The purpose of the Home Equity Assurance Program established under the
provisions of this chapter shall be to guarantee that the value of property of

local adverse housing market conditions within the territory of the Program as
they may differ from municipal-wide, regional or national housing conditions.
The Program is not intended to provide relief from physical perils, such as
natural disasters or acts of God, or from depreciation due to failure to
maintain a residence. Furthermore, the Program is not intended to provide,
serve as or replace homeowner’s insurance or other conventional forms of
insurance.

accepting a registration fee, the Commission shall inform the applicant of the
rights, duties and obligations of both the member and the Commission under the

residence of the applicant appraised by a Program appraiser to determine the

   (D)   A certificate of participation shall then be issued to the eligible

guarantee provided by the Program shall only apply to sales made five years or
more after the date of issuance of the certificate of participation and shall

shall not receive the guarantee unless all conditions, stipulations and
provisions have been met. Any member failing to abide by the conditions,
stipulations and provisions of the Program, or who engages in fraud,
misrepresentation or concealment in any process involving the Program, forfeits
both the registration fee and any claim to the guarantee.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)
§ 1484.07 ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS; COVERAGE.
   (A)   In order to be eligible for benefits, a member must follow the
procedures set forth herein.
   (B)   When an insured residence is placed on the market with the intent to
sell, the member shall submit verifiable evidence of the placement, including
the date that the placement took place. Verifiable evidence may include copies
of advertisements for sale, a contract with a licensed real estate broker or
other evidence found satisfactory to a majority of the Community Relations
Commission (CRC).
   (C)   Upon receipt of verifiable proof by the CRC of the act of placing the
insured residence on the market, a 120-day waiting period shall commence from
the date the insured residence is placed on the market. During the first 90
days of 120-day waiting period, no coverage is afforded under this chapter;
during the last 30 days of the 120-day waiting period, coverage shall be
afforded pursuant to division (F) hereof; at the expiration of the 120-day
waiting period, coverage shall be afforded pursuant to division (H) hereof.
   (D)   A member may offer his or her insured residence for sale or may
exclusively list the residence with a real estate broker for 60 days from the
date the insured residence is placed on the market. Thereafter, a member must
notify the CRC, in writing of his or her inability to obtain an offer for
purchase at the appraised valuation or more and, further, must agree to list
the insured residence with the West Town Board of Realtor’s Multiple Listing
Service, or an agency with comparable sales coverage in the city, for not less
than 60 additional days or until the insured residence is sold, whichever is
sooner.
   (E)   Seventy-five days from the date the insured residence is placed on the
market, an inspection of the insured residence shall be made. That inspection,
by a certified appraiser, shall determine if the insured residence is currently
in at least substantially the same state of repair as it was on the appraised
valuation date. If the insured residence fails to meet this standard, the
following procedure must be followed:
       (1)   The certified appraiser will determine the percentage of
depreciation of the insured residence due to the failure of the owner to
maintain the premises;
      (2)   This percentage figure shall be multiplied by the appraised
valuation to determine the dollar depreciation due to failure to maintain the
premises; and
      (3)   The dollar depreciation shall be subtracted from the appraised
valuation to derive a lower appraised valuation to be used for the purpose of
determining the amount of coverage afforded under this chapter.
   (F)   From 90 through 120 days from the date the insured residence is placed
on the market, coverage shall be in effect as hereinafter set forth. During
this period, a member shall immediately forward to the CRC all offers for
purchase at less than the appraised valuation as determined pursuant to
division (E) hereof. Within three working days from the receipt of the offer(s)
for purchase, the CRC shall either:
      (1)   Approve the offer for purchase, whereupon the member must accept
the offer and the CRC shall authorize payment of the amount of coverage
afforded by §
1484.06, subject to the following conditions:
          (a)   Sales involving eminent domain shall be covered as set forth in
division (I) hereof;
          (b)   Sales subsequent to an insured property and casualty loss shall
be covered as determined by the appraised valuation in division (E) hereof; and
         (c)   Contract sales shall be covered as determined by the appraised
valuation in division (E) hereof, but proceeds payable from the CRC shall be
disbursed in equal annual installments over the life of the contract.
       (2)   Reject the offer, whereupon the member shall continue showing the
insured residence to prospective purchasers; or
      (3)   Exercise the CRC’S (or its agent’s) option to purchase the insured
residence at the offered purchase price, whereupon the CRC shall authorize the
amount of coverage afforded by §
1484.06.
    (G)   Days used to satisfy real estate contract contingencies, including
mortgage contingency provisions, shall not be used in computing the 120-day
waiting period.
   (H)   If one or more offers have been made but not accepted, on the purchase
of the insured residence between the ninetieth and one hundred twentieth day
pursuant to the above provisions, the CRC shall purchase the insured residence
at the highest offered purchase price and shall authorize the amount of
coverage afforded by §
1484.06.
   (I)   Where an insured residence is to be acquired by use of eminent domain,
the following procedures shall apply:
       (1)   If the member rejects an offer from the condemning body equal to
or greater than the appraised value, there shall be no payment under this
Program; and
       (2)   If the condemning body offers less than the appraised values, the
CRC may either:
          (a)   Offer to pay 100% of the difference between the appraised value
and the offering price if the member agrees to sell at the offered price. If
the member does not agree to sell at the offered price, then in no event shall
the member receive from the CRC any payment in excess of the payment set forth
herein; or
          (b)   Advise the member that the offer is inadequate and should be
refused. If the member, under these circumstances, desires to accept the offer,
then the property shall be acquired from the member by the CRC at the offered
price plus 100% of the difference between the offered price and the appraised
value. If the member refuses the offer pursuant to this division and the court
determination of the value of the property is less than the appraised value,
then the CRC shall pay 100% of the difference between the judgment and the
appraised value.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)
§ 1484.08 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Members shall agree to abide by all conditions, stipulations and provisions
of this chapter and shall not be eligible for coverage under this chapter
unless all conditions, stipulations and provisions have been met.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)
§ 1484.09 EXCLUSIONS.
   (A)   Financial losses due to the occurrence of physical perils shall not be
afforded coverage by this chapter.
   (B)   Depreciation due to failure to maintain in good repair the insured
residence shall not be covered. This exclusion is reflected in the adjustment
procedure set forth in §
1484.07(E) whereby a new, lower appraised valuation is derived reflecting this
type of depreciation.
   (C)   Any person who knowingly affirms falsely to any matter or thing
required to be affirmed by the terms of the Program is guilty of perjury.
   (D)   Any fraud, misrepresentation or concealment on the part of a member in
any process involving this chapter or the CRC shall negate all coverage
provided to that member by this chapter.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)
§ 1484.10 NEW APPRAISED VALUATIONS AND VALUATION DATES.
    (A)   A member has the option of applying for a new appraisal by a
certified appraiser, who will then establish a new appraised valuation date.
The new appraised valuation shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Coverage for the new appraised valuation shall not commence until
five years have elapsed from the new appraised valuation date;
      (2)   All former appraised valuations shall remain in full force and
shall be unaffected in any way by the new appraised valuation;
      (3)   The application fee for the new appraisal shall be the standard
application for appraisal fee then being charged by the CRC and shall be paid
by the applicant; and
      (4)   The new appraised valuation shall be subject to all of the
conditions, stipulations and provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The member will be issued a new certificate of participation which
will state the new appraised valuation and the new appraised valuation date.

shall be initiated by a member no more than once within any 12-month period.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)

by the certified appraiser, a three-person arbitration panel will be
established, composed of the following persons: the certified appraiser, an
independent appraiser selected by the applicant or member and an umpire
selected and approved by these two appraisers. The appraised valuation agreed
to by any two of the three panel members shall be binding on all parties
involved under this chapter. The cost of the independent appraiser shall be
borne by the member or applicant. The cost of the umpire shall be borne by the
member or applicant. The cost of the certified appraiser shall be borne by the
member or applicant.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)

months after the sales contract signed by the prospective buyer and the
affidavit executed by the prospective buyer and seller have been presented to
the Community Relations Commission.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)
§ 1484.13 OTHER INSURANCE.
   If other insurance or payment is available to provide coverage similar to
that provided by this chapter, the CRC shall not be liable for a greater
proportion of the loss than the amount of coverage provided by this chapter
bears to the total amount of coverage available from all sources.
(Ord. 96-37, passed 10-8-1996)
§ 1484.14 AMENDMENTS.
    The Home Equity Assurance Program may be amended by the recommendations of

§ 1484.15 IMMUNITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF CITY PERSONNEL.
   (A)   No commissioner, officer or employee, whether on a salary, wage or
voluntary basis, shall be personally liable, and no cause of action may be
brought for damages resulting from the exercise of judgment or discretion in
connection with the performance of Program duties or responsibilities, unless

manner as he or she sees fit.
   (B)   No provision of this chapter or any procedure, regulation or bylaw of

§ 1488.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of the Acquisition and Disposition of Blighted
Property Program (the “Program”) is to promote safe, secure and well built
homes and thereby protect the public health, safety and welfare. Through the

   BUSINESS BUILDING. A structure, public or private, which is adapted for the
transaction of business; the rendering of professional services; amusement; the
display, sale or storage of goods, wares or merchandise; or the performance of
work or labor. BUSINESS BUILDING includes any hotel, lodging house, office
building, public building, church, school, hospital, penal institution, store,

responsibilities as if he or she were the OCCUPANT of the building so vacated.
   OWNER. The actual owner of a residential or business building, whether the
owner is an individual, partnership or corporation or an agent of the building
or another person having custody of the building or to whom rent is paid. If a

   RAT HARBORAGE. Any condition existing in, under, over or outside a structure
of any kind which provides shelter or protection for rats, thus favoring their
multiplication.
   RATSTOPPAGE or RATPROOFING. A relatively inexpensive form of ratproofing to
prevent the ingress of rats into a building from the exterior or from one
building to another. RATSTOPPAGE or RATPROOFING consists essentially of closing

and foundations that may be reached by rats from the ground, by climbing or by
burrowing, with material impervious to rat gnawing.
   RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. A structure adopted, arranged, designed, used or

section. The President of the Board may, after an investigation and
determination by him or her that there is evidence of rat infestation of the
building, order the building quarantined and prohibit any person from entering

poisoning, trapping, harborage removal, fumigation or other measures necessary
to free the building of rats in a manner and under the conditions approved by
the President of the Board and shall continue the work until the building is
freed of rats. The occupant shall free the building of rats and maintain the
building in a ratfree condition thereafter. If the building becomes reinfested
with rats through accident or otherwise, the occupant shall proceed with
approved measures to again free it of rats. If the occupant fails to comply
with the directions and terms of the written notice or order from the President
of the Board, he or she is guilty of a violation of this section. The President
of the Board may order the building quarantined and prohibit any person from
entering the building in the same manner as provided for in §

   The President of the Board of Health may make unannounced inspections of the
interior and exterior of buildings, as in his or her opinion may be necessary
to determine full compliance with this chapter. He or she shall make periodic
inspections of all ratstopped buildings to determine evidence of rat
infestation and the existence of new breaks or leaks in the ratproofing, and
when any evidence is found indicating the presence of rats or openings through
which rats may again enter a building, he or she shall serve the owner or
occupant thereof with notices or orders, or both, to abate the conditions
found.
(Ord. passed 5-21-1979)
§ 1490.07 ACTION BY CITY; LIENS.
   (A)   After notice to an owner and/or an occupant as provided in this

specified in the notice or any extension thereof, take immediate measures for
extermination, ratproofing, eradication work, poisoning, trapping, fumigation
or other measures necessary to free the building of rats and to maintain it in
a ratproof and ratfree condition. The cost and expense incurred in preventing
the ingress of rats to the property and rat extermination shall constitute a
lien upon the real estate affected, and the Law Department is hereby authorized
and directed to file a sworn detailed statement showing the cost and expense
incurred by the Board in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds or in the
office of the Registrar of Titles, if the property affected is under the
Torrens System. The lien shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances
except tax liens, provided that within 60 days after the cost and expense is

notice of lien. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out a
description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof, the
amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred and the date or
dates when the cost and expense were incurred by the Board.
   (B)   However, the lien shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose rights
in and to the real estate have arisen subsequent to the fine and prior to the
filing of the notice, and the lien shall not be valid as to any mortgagee,
judgment creditor or other lienor whose rights in and to the real estate arise
prior to the filing of the notice. Upon payment of the cost and expense by the
owner, occupant or other person interested in the property after the notice of
lien has been filed, release of the lien shall be furnished by the Board and
the release may be filed of record as in the case of filing a notice of lien.
(Ord. passed 5-21-1979)
§ 1490.08 STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS TO ELIMINATE RAT HARBORAGE.
   Whenever the conditions inside or under a building provide such extensive
harborage for rats that the President of the Board of Health deems it necessary
to eliminate the harborage, he or she may require the owner to install suitable
cement floors in basements, to replace wooden first or ground floors or to
correct other conditions related to rat harborage as may be necessary in order
to facilitate the eradication of rats in a reasonable time and thereby reduce
the cost thereof.

   (C)   No person shall permit the accumulation, on any premises, improved or
vacant, or on open lots and alleys in the city, any lumber, box, barrel, brick,
stone or similar material that may be permitted to remain thereon, unless the
same is placed on open racks that are elevated not less than 18 inches above
the ground and evenly piled or stacked so that the material will not afford
harborage for rats. Any exception to this regulation shall ensue only with the
approval of the President of the Board of Health, and the approval can be given
by the President of the Board only when the owner or occupant of the property
carries on a continuous rat eradication program that meets the approval of the
President of the Board, on the property where unlawful accumulation exists.
