policies and procedures set forth in this article.
BONDS: Any bonds issued pursuant to the authority of this article. (1981 Code;
amd. Ord. 1986-0-100, 11-3-1986)
1-2-2: AUTHORITY TO ISSUE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS:
Section 6(a) of article VII of the 1970 constitution of Illinois provides that
"any municipality which has a population of more than 25,000 (is) a home rule
unit". The Village of Oak Park, with a current population in excess of twenty
five thousand (25,000) is, therefore, a home rule unit and may, under the power
granted by section 6(a) of article VII "exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs, including but not limited
to, the power to . . . incur debt".
Section 6(d) of article VII of the 1970 constitution grants constitutional
authority for the Village of Oak Park to incur debt payable from ad valorem
property tax receipts maturing within forty (40) years from the time it is
incurred.
Section 6(k) of article VII of the 1970 constitution of Illinois grants
authority for the Village of Oak Park to incur debt payable from ad valorem tax
receipts without prior referendum approval. (1981 Code)
1-2-3: PROCEDURES:
It is in the best interests of the Village of Oak Park that procedures be
established for incurring debt and issuing bonds payable from ad valorem
property taxes. The Board of Trustees may, therefore, borrow money for lawful
purposes and, in evidence of such borrowing, issue general obligation bonds
payable from ad valorem taxes to be levied without limitation as to rate or
amount against all taxable property situated within the Village. Such bonds may
be issued without the submission of the question of their issuance to the
electors of the Village. The procedures for the adoption of the ordinance
authorizing the issuance of such bonds shall be in accordance with Article 5,
Division 3, of the Illinois Municipal Code, and said procedures shall be
substantially as hereinafter provided.
1-2-4: PUBLIC PURPOSE OF BORROWING:
The Board of Trustees shall adopt an ordinance (hereinafter designated as the
"Bond Ordinance") describing the public purpose or purposes to be served by
such borrowing. Said Bond Ordinance shall make a finding and determination that
such borrowing of money is necessary and pertains to the government and affairs
of the Village, is for a lawful public purpose or purposes, and is in the
public interest, which finding and determination shall be deemed conclusive.
1-2-5: DETAILS OF BOND ORDINANCE; CONTRACT FOR SALE; INTEREST SAVINGS:
The Bond Ordinance shall indicate the amount of money necessary to be borrowed,
the amount of bonds to be issued in evidence thereof, shall fix the details of
such bonds, including their date, number, denomination and maturity (which
cannot exceed forty [40] years from the date of said bonds) and their maximum
rate of interest. The bonds shall be sold in such manner as may be determined
in the Bond Ordinance. If the bonds are authorized to bear interest at the
maximum rate, they shall be sold at a price of not less than par and accrued
interest. If the bonds are authorized to bear interest at a rate less than the
maximum interest rate, they may be sold at a price of less than par, but in any
event, at such a price that the interest cost to the Village of the money
received by it from the proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall not exceed the
maximum interest rate per annum, computed to the average maturity of all bonds
sold as a single issue according to standard tables of bond values.
A contract for the sale of such bonds may be entered into prior to the adoption
of the Bond Ordinance, or the Bond Ordinance may provide for the subsequent
sale of the bonds therein authorized. In the event of such subsequent sale and
(if the bonds bear interest at a rate or rates less than that authorized in
such Bond Ordinance) prior to the delivery of such bonds, the taxes levied in
such Bond Ordinance shall be abated by that amount representing the savings
resulting from the sale of such bonds at a lower rate of interest than
authorized in such Bond Ordinance.
1-2-6: EXECUTION OF BONDS; FORM:
The Bond Ordinance: shall authorize the execution of the bonds therein
authorized on behalf of the Village by signature of the President and attested
by the Village Clerk; shall determine whether such bonds to be issued shall be
registered in the name of the owner as to principal only or whether the same
shall be fully registered as to both principal and interest; shall indicate the
place or places of payment of the principal and interest maturing on said bonds
and shall set forth the form of bond. (1981 Code)
1-2-7: LEVY OF TAXES; ORDINANCE FILED; FUTURE LEVY ABATEMENT:
The Bond Ordinance may make provision for the payment of such bonds, both
principal thereof and interest thereon until maturity, by the levy of a direct
annual tax upon all the taxable property within said Village sufficient for
such purpose. A copy of such Bond Ordinance, as adopted, certified to by the
Village Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the County Clerk of Cook County.
Such Bond Ordinance, as so filed, shall constitute the authority for the County
Clerk in and for each of the years for which taxes are levied in said Bond
Ordinance, to extend such taxes for collection against all the taxable property
situated within the Village of Oak Park. The taxes so levied in and by such
Bond Ordinance shall be extended annually by the County Clerk, in accordance
with law, without limitation as to rate or amount and such taxes shall be in
addition to and in excess of any and all other taxes levied or authorized to be
levied by the Board of Trustees. Such taxes so levied shall not be subject to
repeal or abatement in any manner whatsoever (except as provided below) until
such time as all the bonds authorized and issued under the terms of said Bond
Ordinance shall have been paid in full, both principal thereof and interest
thereon up to and including the date of maturity. However, the Board of
Trustees, having funds available, may appropriate same and order their payment
in trust to the paying agent for any maturities of bonds or interest thereon
due in the future, in which event the taxes to be levied at such future time to
pay such principal or interest may be abated by ordinance of the Board of
Trustees and placed on file with the County Clerk. (1981 Code; amd. Ord. 1986-
0-100, 11-3-86)
1-2-8: APPROPRIATION:
The provisions of any bond ordinance shall constitute a repeatable annual
appropriation of the amounts required as therein referred to and described,
and, upon the delivery of the bonds therein authorized, the proceeds thereof
shall be used solely and only for the purpose or purposes for which the bonds
were authorized. Upon the adoption of any bond ordinance authorizing the
issuance of bonds and providing for the levy of taxes therefor, the same shall
be published by the Village Clerk as provided in the Bond Ordinance.
1-2-9: ILLINOIS MUNICIPAL CODE SUPERSEDED:
Pursuant to the authority granted by section 6 of article VII of the 1970
Constitution of Illinois, the procedures hereby established for the issuance of
general obligation bonds, as herein provided for, shall be controlling and
shall be complied with by the Board of Trustees in the borrowing of money
through the issuance of general obligation bonds of the Village,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the provisions of the

supplementary thereto and any other law or laws of the State of Illinois. (1981

Ordinance may provide or as may be subsequently determined by the Board of
Trustees before the bonds are issued. The bonds may be sold at public or
private sale in such manner and upon such terms as may be deemed advisable by
the Board of Trustees. Such bonds shall be deemed to be securities and
negotiable instruments for all purposes within the meaning of the "Uniform
Commercial Code".
1-3-5: COVENANTS IN BONDS:
Any Bond Ordinance may contain covenants as to:
   A.   The use and disposition of the revenues and receipts from the financing
agreement pursuant to which the bonds are to be issued, including the creation
and maintenance of reserves;
   B.   The issuance of other or additional bonds relating to the project or
any rehabilitation, improvements, renovations, enlargements or additions
thereto;
   C.   The maintenance and repair of the project;

Any Bond Ordinance may provide that the principal of, and interest on, any such
bonds shall be secured by a mortgage or indenture of trust covering any such
project or projects for which the bonds are issued and may include any
improvements or extensions thereafter made. Such mortgage or indenture of trust
may contain such covenants and agreements to properly safeguard the bonds as
may be provided for in the Bond Ordinance, and shall be executed in the manner
as may be provided for in the Bond Ordinance. The provisions of any such Bond
Ordinance and any such mortgage or indenture of trust shall constitute a
contract with the holder or holders of the bond, and continue in effect until
the principal of, the interest on, and the redemption premiums, if any, on the
bonds so issued have been fully paid, as provided in the Bond Ordinance. The
duties of the Village and its officers under any Bond Ordinance, and any such
mortgage or indenture of trust, shall be enforceable by any bondholder by
mandamus, foreclosure of any such mortgage or indenture of trust or other
appropriate suit, action or proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction;

Village as may be designated in the Bond Ordinance, and such signatures shall
be the valid and binding signatures of the officers of the Village,
notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payments therefor, any or
all of the persons whose signatures appear thereon have ceased to be officers
of the Village. The validity of the bonds is not dependent on nor affected by
the validity or regularity of any proceedings relating to the acquisition,
purchase, construction, reconstruction, improvement, equipping, betterment,
extension, or financing of the project for which the bonds are issued. The Bond
Ordinance may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are
issued pursuant to this Article which recital shall be conclusive evidence of
their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.
1-3-7: LIEN OF BONDS:
All bonds issued under this Article shall have a lien upon the revenues and
receipts derived from the financing agreement for which the bonds have been
issued, and the Board of Trustees may provide in the Bond Ordinance for the
issuance of additional bonds to be equally and ratably secured by a lien upon
such revenues and receipts, or may provide that the lien upon such revenues and
receipts is subordinate.
1-3-8: LIABILITY FOR BONDS:
All bonds issued under and pursuant to this Article shall be limited
obligations of the Village payable solely out of the revenues and receipts
derived from the financing agreement with respect to which such bonds are
issued. No holder of any bonds issued under this Article has the right to
compel any exercise of the taxing power of the Village to pay the bonds, the
interest or premium (if any) thereon, and the bonds do not constitute an
indebtedness of the Village, or a loan of credit thereof within the meaning of
any constitutional or statutory provision. It shall be plainly stated on the
face of each bond that it has been issued under the provisions of this Article
and that it does not constitute an indebtedness of the Village or a loan of
credit thereof within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory
provisions.
1-3-9: EXEMPTION FROM CONSTRUCTION AND BIDDING REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC
BUILDINGS:
The acquisition and construction of a project shall not be subject to any
requirements relating to public buildings, structures, grounds, works or
improvements imposed by the Illinois Revised Statutes or any other similar
requirements which may be lawfully waived by this Section, and any requirement
of competitive bidding or restriction imposed on the procedure for award of
contracts for such purpose, or the lease, sale or other disposition of property
of the Village is not applicable to any action taken under authority of this
Article.
1-3-10: POWERS CONFERRED AS ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL; LIMITATIONS IMPOSED;
EFFECT:
The powers conferred by this Article are in addition and supplemental to, and
the limitations imposed by this Article shall not affect, the powers conferred
by any law or any other article or ordinance. Projects may be acquired,
purchased, constructed, reconstructed, improved, bettered, equipped, extended
and financed, and bonds may be issued under this Article for such purposes,
notwithstanding that any law or any other article or ordinance may provide for
the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, improvement,
equipping, betterment, extension and financing of a like project, or the
issuance of bonds for like purposes, and without regard to the requirements,
restrictions, limitations or other provisions contained in any law or any other
article or ordinance.

act or omission in determining policy, the Village shall:
      1.   Appear and defend against the claim or action; and
      2.   Pay or indemnify the member of the Board of Trustees for a judgment
and court costs based on such claim or action; and
      3.   Pay or indemnify the member of the Board of Trustees for a
compromise or settlement of such claim or action, providing the settlement is

   D.   The President, subject to the advice and consent of the Board of
Trustees, may extend a chair or member's final term beyond a term limit
provided by this section under one of the following conditions: 1) if the chair
or member's failure to continue to serve on the applicable board or commission
would negatively impact the completion of a special project or other matter; or
2) if the chair or member possesses professional qualifications which are
required for service on the applicable board or commission and another person
with such qualifications has not applied to serve on the board or commission. A
term extension pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed twelve (12) months.
   E.   A chair or member who has completed his or her service on a board or
commission pursuant to an applicable term limit may apply to serve on another
board or commission at any time, or may apply to serve on the same board or
commission on which he or she served upon a twelve (12) month waiting period

by the Village exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) including any
required Village match, unless such contract or grant application shall have

Board of Trustees.
In cases of urgently needed material or urgent repairs involving labor and
material, such repairs and material may be obtained through negotiated contract
without formal advertising with the approval of the Village Manager, when it is
in the best interest of the Village and when it is impractical to convene a
meeting of the Board of Trustees.

statement. A domestic partner may terminate a registered domestic partnership
by filing a termination statement with the Village Clerk, executed under oath

established hereunder. If the termination statement has not been signed by both
domestic partners, the other domestic partner shall be notified of such
termination by registered mail, return receipt requested, and the termination
statement shall declare that such notification has occurred. A termination
statement shall also be delivered to any third party to whom a domestic partner
has given a Certificate of Domestic Partnership in order to qualify for a right
or benefit. The termination statement shall be delivered to all parties set
forth hereinabove within thirty (30) days of the termination of the domestic
partnership.
If a domestic partnership is terminated by the death of a domestic partner,
there shall be no required waiting period prior to filing another domestic
partnership. If a domestic partnership is terminated by one or both domestic
partners, neither domestic partner may file another domestic partnership
declaration until six (6) months have elapsed from termination.

of Domestic Partnership, amendments to declarations and notices of termination
received by the Village Clerk. The records shall be maintained so that
amendments and notices of termination are filed with the registered Declaration
of Domestic Partnership to which they pertain.
      2.   The declarations, and amendments thereto, and termination notices
shall be maintained by the Village Clerk as public records subject to
disclosure pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.
      3.   The certified copy of the registered declaration may be used as
evidence of the existence of a domestic partnership.
   F.   Fees: The Village Clerk shall charge a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
for the registration or termination of a Declaration of Domestic Partnership
and shall charge a reasonable fee per document for providing certified copies
of registered declarations, amendments of declarations or notices of
termination. There shall be no additional charge for the issuance of the
original certified copies of the registered declaration to each domestic
partner or for the filing of amendments to registered declarations or notices
of termination.
   G.   Enforcement By Civil Action: Any person or employer may bring a civil
action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the appropriate domestic
partner(s) to recover damages when such person or employer has relied upon a
registered Declaration of Domestic Partnership to the person's or employer's
detriment as a result of:
      1.   A false statement in a Declaration of Domestic Partnership or a
false assertion of family membership; or
      2.   A failure to notify the Village Clerk, or any person or employer
previously notified of a domestic partnership of a change in the status of the
domestic partnership or family membership.

partners under this Section for failure to list a dependent in a registered

It is the policy of the Village that its employees and elected and appointed
officers should, in all cases, exercise their judgment and perform their duties
for the sole benefit of the citizens of the Village. To this end all such
persons should avoid accepting or retaining any economic benefits or
opportunities which could impair or present an actual threat to the exercise of
independent judgment. It is further the policy of the Village that all
appearances of impropriety shall be avoided. The Board of Trustees hereby
determines that a policy setting forth ethical principles and regulations
applicable to public officials and employees is in the best interests of the
Village and will contribute to the public confidence in the integrity, ability
and performance of said persons. (Ord. 1993-0-24, 4-7-1993)
2-25-2: ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THE VILLAGE BOARD:
   A.   Creation; Terms: There shall be created an Ethics Committee of the
Village Board which shall have the duties and powers, unless otherwise
provided, to hear complaints and rule upon the appropriate disposition of the
ethics ordinance. The Committee shall consist of the Village President and all
of the Village's Trustees then holding office. The Village President shall

or herself, the remaining Committee members shall appoint a new, temporary
Chairperson for this purpose.

article, including prosecuting and hearing complaints on violations of this
article by elected or appointed officers and employees. The Committee shall
also, upon request, advise the Village Attorney or other elected or appointed

statement shall include the legal description and common address of the real
estate and shall indicate the ownership interest held in such real estate.
For the purpose of this Section, the ownership of a beneficial interest in real
estate held in land trust, real property being purchased by contract or real
property held by a corporation, an investment group or partnership in which the
person filing, or the spouse or minor children of such person, shall own more
than a five percent (5%) interest, shall be considered real property.
The property in which the person resides shall be exempt from the provisions of
this Section, unless said property contains more than three (3) residential

2-25-5: DISCLOSURE OF BUSINESS INTERESTS:

required to file disclosure statements shall not be available for public

herein shall prevent the Village Clerk from establishing reasonable rules and
regulations governing when the records may be viewed and from requiring a
reasonable charge for copying any of said records. (Ord. 1993-0-24, 4-7-93)
2-25-8: NEW OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY:
   A.   Policy Statement: The Village government licenses and regulates
multiple-family dwellings in Oak Park so as to insure proper maintenance and
also regulates in connection with the enforcement of fair housing regulations.
The Village government is also involved as the mortgagee in loans to owners of
real property and purchases single-family and multiple-family residences for
rehabilitation and repair. Therefore, a potential conflict of interest exists
where a person is in a decision making or regulatory position with the Village
and owns or has an interest in local real estate, or is employed by someone who
owns or has an interest in local real estate.
   B.   Restrictions on Ownership of Real Property: The Village Manager, any
attorney employed on a permanent basis by the Village, department heads and
other Village employees as designated by the Village Manager as being involved
in regulation of housing and building on behalf of the Village, including the
spouses of such persons, shall not be employed by or otherwise receive a direct
benefit from an association with the owner of any licensed multiple-family
dwelling within the Village and shall not purchase or contribute financially to
the purchase of real property within the corporate limits of the Village,
unless said person shall use the property as his place of residence and the
property contains no more than three (3) residential units, or shall use it as
a residence for the employee's parents, parents-in-law or children and the
property contains no more than one family unit. It is further the policy of the
Village to encourage said persons to divest themselves of presently owned real
property within the corporate limits of the Village except insofar as it is
used as said person's or family's place of residence. Persons seeking
employment in any position to which this restriction applies must be in
compliance with this restriction prior to employment in said position.
Exceptions may be made to the restrictions of this Section by the Board of
Trustees where the Board finds that the purchase of real property or an
interest therein will not involve the purchaser in any possibility of a
substantial conflict of interest. (Ord. 1993-0-24, 4-7-93)
2-25-9: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT:
   A.   Impartiality: Every elected and appointed officer and employee shall
perform his or her duties with impartiality and without prejudice or bias for

interest of the spouse or minor children of the elected or appointed officer or
employee.
   D.   Interest in Contract, Legislative or Administrative Action,

   B.   Upon receipt of an application for the initial issuance of a local

Board of Trustees has created a liquor license category of the type applied
for, and if a liquor license in such category is available to be issued by the
Commissioner. The Commissioner shall forward it to the Liquor Control Review
Board, together with the Commissioner's findings and instructions, for review,
provided, however, that in the case of a special event class E-2 liquor
license, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may grant or deny the license by
letter to the applicant, without referral to the Liquor Control Review Board or
the Village Board, provided that the Commissioner may only grant a license if
he or she determines that the license is authorized in accordance with
subsection
3-4-2E2 of this chapter, and the applicant has complied with the requirements
of subsection
3-2-3B of this chapter. An applicant may appeal the denial of a special event
class E-2 liquor license as set forth in section
3-7-9 of this article. Notwithstanding the provisions in section
3-7-5 of this article, no special event class E-2 liquor license may be

   C.   The Liquor Control Review Board shall, upon receipt of a liquor license
application, conduct an investigation of the advisability of issuing a liquor
license in an existing category, or the creation of a new category of liquor

investigation shall include, but is not limited to, determining those facts
which show if the applicant meets all requirements of the Illinois liquor
control act, and all other applicable State statutes, and ordinances of the
Village, relating to the granting of a local liquor license. The investigation
shall also include an examination of the experience of the applicant in the
business proposed to be conducted by the applicant and such facts as may be
considered necessary by the Commissioner and the Liquor Control Review Board to
demonstrate the likelihood of financial success of the applicant in the
proposed business. Opinions of the Commissioner and the Liquor Control Review
Board members with respect to such financial success which are not supported by
findings of fact shall not, in and of themselves, be grounds for denial of a
liquor license by the Commissioner, or for the refusal of the President and
Board of Trustees to create the category of liquor license applied for.
   D.   The Liquor Control Review Board shall, upon the completion of its
investigation, forward to the Commissioner a report of the facts determined in
its investigation, and its recommendations concerning the application, and the
creation of the category of liquor license applied for, if required. Upon
receipt of such report, the Commissioner may accept it, reject it, in whole or
in part, return it to the Liquor Control Review Board for further proceedings
as directed by the Commissioner, or take such other action as the Commissioner
believes appropriate.
   E.   The Commissioner shall, within a reasonable time in light of all
circumstances, forward the report to the President and Board of Trustees,
containing the Commissioner's recommendations concerning the creation of a new
liquor license in an existing category or a new liquor license category
requested by the applicant. The report shall also state the recommendation of
the Liquor Control Review Board and shall indicate the position of the
Commissioner with regard to such recommendation.
   F.   Upon receipt of the report of the Commissioner, the Village Board shall
determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not to create the new liquor
license in the existing category or the new liquor license category addressed
in the report and, if appropriate, the creation of a new liquor license under
the new category.
   G.   Within such time as the Commissioner judges appropriate after the
creation by the President and Board of Trustees of the local liquor license
requested by the applicant, the Commissioner shall issue the liquor license to
the applicant, if the Commissioner has determined that the applicant has
satisfied all requirements for the local liquor license.
   H.   In the event that an application is rejected by the Commissioner, the
Village Board may overrule the Commissioner and direct the Commissioner to
issue the liquor license if the applicant appeals the decision of the
Commissioner to the Village Board in writing within thirty (30) days of the
rejection of the application by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner is
overruled by the Village Board and the Village Board has, by ordinance, created
a new liquor license category and liquor license therefor, or a new liquor
license in an existing category of the class applied for by the applicant, the
Commissioner shall issue such liquor license to the applicant. (Ord. 2013-0-24,

application is not filed within the time prescribed, the Commissioner may

and may proceed accordingly.

Commissioner shall forward it to the Liquor Control Review Board for review.
   C.   The Liquor Control Review Board shall conduct an investigation to
determine facts concerning the continued qualifications of the licensee to hold
a local liquor license; the compliance by the licensee with all applicable
statutes and ordinances during the term of the liquor license; the continued
advisability of allowing the licensee to renew the licensee's liquor license,
and the advisability of continuing such category of local liquor license.
   D.   Within such time as the Commissioner may prescribe by regulation, the
Liquor Control Review Board shall submit a report to the Commissioner. Such
report shall state the findings of fact made by the Liquor Control Review Board
as a result of its investigation, and its recommendation about the renewal or
nonrenewal of the liquor license.
   E.   Upon receipt of the report of the Liquor Control Review Board, the
Commissioner may accept it, reject it, in whole or in part, return it to the
Liquor Control Review Board for further proceedings as directed by the
Commissioner or take such other action as the Commissioner feels appropriate.
If the Commissioner believes that the liquor license is to be renewed, the
Commissioner shall do so within such time as the Commissioner considers
appropriate in light of all the circumstances. If the Commissioner decides that
the liquor license should not be renewed, the Commissioner shall, not later
than five (5) days prior to the expiration of the current liquor license,
notify the licensee of such decision.

President and Board of Trustees. The Commissioner shall also report all

made. Upon receipt of such report, the President and Board of Trustees may, not
later than the second regularly scheduled meeting thereof after the expiration,
without appeal, of the final date upon which the applicant may file an appeal
with the Village Board of the Commissioner's decision to reject the applicant's
renewal application, cancel the category of liquor license, or reduce the
number of liquor licenses available in such category.
   G.   If the President and Board of Trustees do not act to cancel the
category of liquor license or reduce the number of liquor licenses available in
such category within the time limit prescribed herein, the Commissioner may
issue a liquor license in such category to any applicant therefor, provided the
procedure required by section
3-7-4 of this article has been complied with. (Ord. 1994-0-43, 8-1-1994)

person or animal.

dangerous animal, the owner, at the owner's expense, shall have an identifying
microchip installed under the animal's skin by a veterinarian.

dangerous animal, the owner must procure and maintain in effect liability
insurance, including coverage of claims arising from the conduct of the owner's
animal, in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)

Village. The insurance shall include a provision requiring the insurer to
notify the Village Manager not less than thirty (30) days prior to cancellation
or lapse of coverage.
   E.   The Village Manager may order the owner to comply with any of the
following requirements, in any combination, where an animal is declared to be a
dangerous animal and the animal is not humanely destroyed:
      1.   The owner must confine the dangerous animal to the secure enclosure
described above in subsection
5-5-5D1 of this section at all times and only allow the animal out under the
conditions set forth in subsection
5-5-5D2 of this section when it is necessary to obtain veterinary care for the
animal, comply with a court order, or where an emergency is declared by a
government agency requiring evacuation of the owner.
      2.   The owner and the animal must complete a course of animal obedience
training approved by the Village Manager.

premises warning that a dangerous animal is on the premises, which sign
provides in capital letters as follows:

Manager shall send written notice to the owner, by first class mail, stating
that his or her animal has been declared a dangerous animal, describing the
basis for such declaration by specific behavior and date(s) of occurrence,
setting forth all applicable orders and restrictions imposed reason of such
declaration, and informing the owner of his or her right to appeal such
determination by filing a written request for an appeal hearing within fourteen
(14) days of service of the notice. A notice shall be deemed served on the date
the notice is mailed. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the complainant,
if any. Where the animal has been impounded pursuant to subsection
5-5-5H of this section, such notice shall be sent within thirty (30) days after
such impoundment.
 
   G.   If the owner requests an appeal of the Village Manager's determination,
the Director of Adjudication shall appoint a hearing officer and hold an appeal
hearing, at which all interested parties may present testimony and any other
relevant evidence, within thirty (30) days of the request for an appeal
hearing. The appeal hearing shall be taped or recorded by other appropriate
means. If the hearing officer upholds the Village Manager's determination that
the animal is dangerous, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to satisfy all
requirements set out in subsection
5-5-5D of this section and in the notice. In those cases where the Village
Manager has ordered humane destruction of the dangerous animal, that order
shall not be carried out until seven (7) days after the appeal hearing; if the
owner files an appeal to the circuit court during that time period, that order
shall be stayed until resolution of such appeal.
   H.   Where there is probable cause to believe that an animal is a dangerous
animal, the Village Manager is authorized to impound and hold such animal, at
the owner's expense, pending the investigation and final resolution of any
appeals. Where the animal has caused severe injury or death to any person, the
Village Manager is required to impound and hold such animal, at the owner's
expense, pending the investigation and final resolution of any appeal. In no
event shall a dangerous animal be released to its owner before the owner
obtains a dangerous animal license pursuant to section
5-4-4 of this chapter and complies with this section. The holding period and
impoundment procedures for animals of unknown ownership shall be governed by
section

require a deposit in an amount or amounts to be paid by the owner to the
Village in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of impoundment during the
pendency of any investigation and final resolution of any appeals pursuant to
this article.
   I.   Guard dogs and dogs which have been found to be "vicious dogs" under
state law, automatically are required to comply with the requirements of

plan that establishes a building or site's overall sign design, which then
provides direction to future tenants. A master sign plan must include, at a
minimum, criteria and specifications for general appearance, location,
lighting, and approved construction materials. (Ord. 2009-0-019, 3-23-09)
7-7-7: ESTABLISHMENT OF SIGN OVERLAY DISTRICTS:
   A.   Sign Overlay Districts: The following sign overlay districts are
established, and are mapped in subsection
7-7-7C of this section:
      1.   Residential Sign Overlay District: The purpose of the residential
sign overlay district is to ensure proper regulation of signs common to
residential areas for both limited nonresidential uses that need to identify
their location and services, and the variety of temporary and noncommercial
signs residents may require, provided in a manner that is not contrary to the
established predominant residential character of the district.
      2.   Downtown Sign Overlay District: The purpose of the downtown sign
overlay district is to ensure that signs within the downtown are compatible
with the character and image of the downtown, and provide businesses with a
number of alternatives for identifying their premises and the goods and/or
services sold on the premises to pedestrian and automotive patrons.
      3.   Neighborhood Commercial Sign Overlay District: The purpose of the
neighborhood commercial sign overlay district is to ensure that signs within
these areas are able to balance the needs of commercial users located within or
adjacent to residential neighborhoods to identify their premises and the goods
and/or services sold on the premises without negative impact to the character
of the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Signs within the neighborhood
commercial areas are to be primarily oriented toward the pedestrian.
      4.   Corridor Commercial Sign Overlay District: The purpose of the
corridor commercial sign overlay district is to ensure that signs located along
major arterials provide an effective means of identifying their premises and
the goods and/or services sold on the premises, as well as presenting a
positive and coordinated appearance along the roadway. Signs within the
corridor commercial areas are to be primarily oriented toward the automobile.
   B.   Hospital Use: A hospital that falls within any of the sign overlay
districts established is subject to the regulations for a "hospital", as
defined in this article, provided under section
7-7-17 of this article.
   C.   Sign Overlay District Location: The sign overlay districts are shown in
figure 7.7.7-1, as follows:

(Ord. 2009-0-019, 3-23-09)
7-7-8: DIMENSION MEASUREMENT:
   A.   Computation Of Sign Area: Sign area is calculated as described in this
section.
      1.   For signs on a background, the entire area of the background shall
be calculated for sign area, including any material or color forming the sign
face or background used to differentiate the sign from the structure against
which it is placed. Sign area does not include any supporting framework or
bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/939533cf0e4682a2aa68b2d78fc3bca5e1eb689b/

IMAGES/0-0-0-3268.jpg]
      2.   For signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, the area of a
sign face ("sign area") is calculated by means of the smallest square, circle,
rectangle or triangle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme
limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display. Sign area does
not include any supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or
bracing is part of the message or sign face. Window signs printed on a
transparent film and affixed to a window pane shall be considered freestanding
letters or logos, provided that the portion of the transparent film around the
perimeter of the sign message maintains the transparent character of the window
and does not contain any items in the sign message.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3270.jpg]
      3.   The sign area of free form or sculptural (nonplanar) signs is
calculated as fifty percent (50%) of the sum of the area of the four (4)
vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/939533cf0e4682a2aa68b2d78fc3bca5e1eb689b/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3272.jpg]
      4.   For a double faced sign, if the interior angle between two (2) sign
faces is forty five degrees (45°) or less, the sign area is computed as the
area of one face only. If the angle between two (2) sign faces is greater than
forty five degrees (45°), the sign area is computed as the sum of the areas of
the two (2) faces.
   B.   Measurement Of Sign Height: Sign height is measured as described below.
When measuring sign height, the height of the entire structure, including
decorative elements, must be included. Sign height is measured from the
elevation of the grade at the midpoint of the sign.
      1.   Pole and monument signs: The vertical distance measured from the
grade to the highest point of the sign.

the owner and, when applicable, issuance of a sign permit.
      3.   No sign mounted on the exterior of a building shall cover any
windows, doors or any architectural features.
      4.   On a corner lot, no freestanding sign over two feet (2') tall may be
placed within the clear sight area. The "clear sight area", as defined in
section
25-1-8 of this code, is a triangle with one point at the intersection of the
intersecting streets' centerlines, and the other two (2) points located on each
street's centerline one hundred feet (100') away from the intersection of said
centerlines. The clear sight area is illustrated below.

watertight and the structure does not exceed allowable stresses of supporting
materials. All fasteners used to attach signs to a structure or building shall
be properly sized for the design loads and material of the support, have a
minimum cross section diameter of one-fourth inch (1/4"), and be made of
corrosion resistant material.
   C.   Design Loads (Wind, Direct, And Snow): All signs and awnings must be
designed and constructed to withstand their self-weight (dead load), a wind
pressure of no less than thirty (30) pounds per square foot, snow loads as
required by the Village Code, and ASCE/SEI minimum design loads for buildings
and other structures.
   D.   Illumination:
      1.   Any sign illumination, including gooseneck reflectors and internally
illuminated signs, and all electronic signs must be designed, located, shielded
and directed to prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon roadways and
surrounding properties, or the distraction of motor vehicle operators or
pedestrians in the public right of way. In the case of internally illuminated
signs, the sign face must function as a filter for any illumination.
      2.   No sign illumination shall exceed one (1) foot candle of
illumination at the property line, except for projecting signs and wall signs
where illumination shall not exceed one (1) foot candle at its face.
      3.   The use of neon lighting as an accent is permitted for projecting,
window and wall signs in the downtown, neighborhood commercial and corridor
commercial sign overlay districts, subject to the following:
         a.   Neon lighting shall be used as an accent material on projecting
and wall signs, such as for letters, logos and/or sign details. No projecting,
window or wall sign may be entirely illuminated with neon.
         b.   Neon lighting on projecting and wall signs shall not be
illuminated during the daylight hours. When lit, neon lighting must be
continuously illuminated. Flashing neon is prohibited.
         c.   Neon lighting on projecting and wall signs shall not be combined
with any reflective materials (e.g., mirrors, polished metal, highly glazed
tiles, or other similar materials) that would cause glare and increase the
spread of light.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3280.gif]
      4.   Any lighting, either incandescent, fluorescent, neon or other light
source, including strip lighting, for outlining buildings or elements, such as
doors and windows is prohibited.
      5.   Any sign that uses illumination shall be turned off while the
related business is not open to the public for regular distribution of goods or
services.
   E.   Landscaping: All ground signs must be landscaped at the base of the
sign in accordance with the following:
      1.   Landscaping must extend a minimum of two feet (2') from the sign
base on all sides. All landscaping must be maintained in good condition, and
free and clear of rubbish and weeds. Landscaping around the base of a sign is
included in the total amount of landscaping required on a site, if applicable.
      2.   Ground signs (monument or pole) must be landscaped with small shrubs
a minimum of eighteen inches (18") in height at planting. The remainder of the
landscaped area must be planted with perennials, turf or other ground cover. If
the ground sign is designed with a decorative base, landscaping requirements
may be waived as part of sign permit approval.
   F.   Glass: Glass forming any part of a sign must be safety glass.

   J.   Design Criteria: The purpose of the design criteria set forth below is
to establish a checklist of those items relative to signs that affect the
physical aspect of Oak Park's environment. Pertinent to signs is the design of
the sign and its relation to building and structures, planting, street
furniture and miscellaneous other objects.
The following criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or
variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles that can result
in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within
the Village, preserve property values and promote the public health, safety and
welfare:
      1.   Every sign shall have good scale and proportion in its design and in
its visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.
      2.   Sign materials, size, color, lettering, location and arrangement
shall be an integral part of site and building design.
      3.   The colors, materials and lighting of every sign shall be restrained
and harmonious.
      4.   The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the
minimum needed to convey the sign's major message, and shall be composed in
proportion to the area of the sign face. Text should be kept to a minimum.
      5.   Lighting for signs shall be in harmony with the signs' and the
project's design. If external lighting is used, it should be arranged so the
light source is shielded from view.
      6.   Sign supports and braces shall whenever possible be an integral part
of the sign design. Necessary supports or braces shall whenever possible be
hidden from public view. (Ord. 2009-0-019, 3-23-2009; amd. Ord. 2014-0-11, 2-

   A.   Maximum Surface Area; All Exterior Signs:
      1.   The surface area of all exterior signs, including permanent window
signs, shall not exceed, in the aggregate, three (3) square feet per linear
foot of width of lot for the first one hundred (100) linear feet, and one
square foot per linear foot of width of lot for each linear foot in excess of
one hundred (100).
      2.   Width of lot shall be measured at the front lot line; provided,
however, for lots having more than one street line, width of the lot shall be
measured at the street line of the greatest dimension lying in a frontage which
is wholly within a commercial or industrial district; or, in the street line of
the shortest dimension if the lot has no street line lying in a frontage which
is wholly within a commercial district.
   B.   Projecting Signs: Projecting signs are permitted in the downtown,
neighborhood commercial and corridor commercial sign overlay districts, subject
to the following. Projecting signs are prohibited in the residential sign
overlay district.
      1.   The maximum area of a projecting sign is as follows:
         a.   Downtown sign overlay district: Twenty four (24) square feet.
         b.   Neighborhood commercial sign overlay district: Twenty four (24)
square feet.
         c.   Corridor commercial sign overlay district: Thirty two (32) square
feet, except for lots fronting on Madison Street and Garfield Street, where the
maximum allowable area is twenty four (24) square feet.
      2.   One projecting sign per ground floor establishment with frontage on
a public street is permitted. In the case of a multi-tenant building, one
additional projecting sign identifying the name of the multi-tenant development
is permitted.
      3.   A projecting sign must be pinned away from the wall at least six
inches (6"). Projecting signs shall not project more than six and one-half feet
(6.5') from the face of the building to which they are attached, including the
area between the sign and the face of the building, and in no event more than
within two feet (2') of the curb line of any street or alley. Provided,
however, where more than one-half (1/2) of the frontage in a block is located
in a residence district, no sign, other than a sign permitted in a residence
district, shall project more than twelve inches (12") beyond the face of the
building or structure, unless a yard is provided, the depth of which is in
excess of that required in the business district, in which case, a sign may
project into the nonrequired portion of such yard, but in no event shall such
sign be closer to the street line than:
         a.   The required residential setback; or
         b.   The actual average setback, for the residentially zoned portion
of the frontage, whichever is less. Unless such sign is one hundred feet (100')
or more from the residentially zoned property, then said sign shall project not
more than six feet six inches (6'6") into the public right of way and in no
event more than within two feet (2') of any street or alley.

      5.   Projecting signs, including frames, braces, and supports must be
designed by a licensed structural engineer or manufacturer. No projecting sign
may be secured with external wire, chains, cables, strips of wood or nails nor
may any projecting sign be hung or secured to any other sign. Any removable
part of a projecting sign, such as the cover of a service opening, must be
securely fastened internally by chains or hinges.
      6.   External illumination, such as gooseneck type lighting, is permitted
on projecting signs provided that illumination is concentrated on the area of
the sign face only. Projecting signs may be internally illuminated in the
downtown and corridor commercial sign overlay districts only, provided
internally illuminated signs are constructed with an opaque background with
only letters, logos and/or details as translucent features.
      7.   Time and temperature devices are permitted as part of projecting
signs. Such devices must be included in all calculations of sign area.

downtown, neighborhood commercial and corridor commercial sign overlay
districts and for nonresidential uses in the residential sign overlay district,
subject to the following:
      1.   Permanent window signs affixed to or painted on the inside of a
window shall be considered to be wall signs subject to all such regulations and
shall occupy no more than twenty five percent (25%) of the surface of each
window area. Window area is counted as a continuous surface until divided by an
architectural or structural element. Mullions are not considered an element
that divides window area.
      2.   The total area of all temporary and permanent window signs must not
occupy more than fifty percent (50%) of the total window area. Temporary window
signs are subject to the regulations of subsection
7-7-13B6b of this article.
      3.   Neon window signs are considered a window sign and must be included
in the twenty five percent (25%) limitation. However, no more than fifteen
percent (15%) of total window area may be comprised of neon window signs. Neon
window sign area is measured by the height and width of the sign. Neon window
signs are prohibited in all residential sign overlay districts.
      4.   All ground floor street-side building facades must allow pedestrians
to view goods and activities inside and encourage walking and browsing.
Substantially opaque, frosted, etched, tinted, black, and reflective mirror
glass are prohibited.
   D.   Wall Signs: Permanent wall signs are permitted in the downtown,
neighborhood commercial and corridor commercial sign overlay districts and for
nonresidential uses in the residential sign overlay district, subject to the
following:
      1.   Within the downtown, neighborhood commercial and corridor commercial
sign overlay districts, the maximum size of a wall sign shall be established at
one square foot per linear foot of zoning lot frontage. Within residential
districts, wall signs are permitted at a size of one square foot per linear
foot of zoning lot frontage up to a maximum size of forty (40) square feet.
         a.   For an interior lot, the maximum size of a wall sign shall be
established at one square foot per linear foot of zoning lot frontage as
measured along the front lot line.
         b.   For a corner lot, the maximum size of a wall sign located on each
building wall shall be established at one square foot per linear foot of zoning
lot frontage as measured along the front or corner side lot line of that
building wall. The size of a wall sign on each side of the building shall be
limited to the square footage calculated on that side only. In no case shall
the square footage permitted for the building wall located along the front lot
line and the square footage permitted for the building wall located along the
corner side lot line be combined to create a larger sign on a wall other than
that permitted on each individual wall.
         c.   In a multi-tenant structure, each tenant shall be permitted a
wall sign of one square foot per linear foot of business frontage, with a
minimum of twenty five (25) square feet permitted for a wall sign for each
tenant. In no case shall the total amount of wall signs on the structure exceed
one square foot per linear foot of business frontage or the sum total of twenty
five (25) square feet per tenant, whichever is greater. If a multi-tenant
structure is located on a corner lot, the maximum size of the wall sign located
on the wall along the corner lot line shall be limited to one square foot per
linear foot of zoning lot frontage as measured along the front lot line, with a
minimum of twenty five (25) square feet per tenant permitted.
      2.   If there is a secondary entrance, an additional wall sign is
permitted but shall be limited to no more than sixteen (16) square feet and

or similar term.
      3.   Wall signs must be safely and securely attached to the building
wall. Wall signs must be affixed flat against the building wall and must not
project more than twelve inches (12") from the building wall. No aesthetic sign
elements may be affixed or painted directly on a building's exterior facade.
All signs must be mounted in such a way that they may be removed with minimal
impact on the building's exterior wall.
      4.   No wall sign affixed to a building, including sign support
structure, may project beyond the ends or top of the wall to which it is
attached. On existing buildings, a parapet wall must not be constructed for the
sole purpose of increasing the allowable height of a wall sign. For new
buildings, when a sign is to be mounted on a parapet wall, that parapet wall
must be consistent with the architectural design of the building, including
building materials. Wall signs may not be attached to unreinforced masonry
parapets. Wall signs shall not cover windows, doors or architectural features.
      5.   Wall signs should be located on the sign frieze or the sign band of
the building immediately above the first floor window and below the second
floor windowsills in the case of a two-story building. No wall sign shall be
permitted to rise above the second story sill line. On one-story buildings, the
top of the sign shall be no more than five feet (5') above the top of the main
display window on the first floor.
      6.   Gooseneck reflectors are permitted on all wall signs provided the
reflectors must concentrate the illumination upon the area of the sign face
only. Internally illuminated signs shall be constructed with an opaque
background with only letters, logos and/or details as translucent features. A
white or light-colored background is prohibited.
      7.   Within a multi-tenant commercial development, all wall signs must be
located at a generally uniform height on the building wall.
      8.   Time and temperature devices are permitted as part of wall signs.
Such devices are included in all calculations of sign area.
      9.   Ghost signs are considered wall signs. Existing ghost signs are
exempt from these requirements and are considered conforming. No new wall signs
may be painted on buildings or structures.
   E.   Awnings And Canopies: Awnings and canopies that are considered an
architectural feature of a building and are not used for identifying the
premises or the goods and/or services sold are not considered a sign. Awnings
and canopies used as signs are considered to be wall signs subject to all such
regulations and are further subject to the following regulations:
      1.   Awnings and canopies are permitted in any sign overlay district for
multi-family residential and nonresidential uses.
      2.   All awnings or canopies must maintain a minimum seven foot (7')

from the nominators, owner(s) of record, and any other interested parties who
wish to be heard and/or present evidence on the application of the criteria for
designation, set forth in Section 7-9-4 of this Article, to the proposed
historic landmark. The Commission shall hear testimony and receive evidence in

Board, the Village Clerk or the Village Clerk's designee, the Development
Customer Service Department and to the owner(s) of record, a resolution and
report recommending designation if such a determination has been made by the

the full members of the Commission to recommend designation to the Village
Board. The resolution shall include or be accompanied by a written report
summarizing the evidence presented at the hearing, setting forth findings of
fact based thereon, and explaining the basis for the Commission's
recommendation. A decision by the Commission not to recommend designation is

the owner and nominators of its decision not to recommend designation within
forty-five (45) days of the completion of the public hearing. The Commission
shall not consider the re-nomination of the same or a substantially similar
historic landmark for at least one year following submission of the original
nomination and the nominated property shall not be considered an eligible
historic landmark during that time.
   B.   Within thirty (30) days after receiving the resolution and report
containing the recommendation for designation from the Commission, the Village
Board shall either designate the historic landmark or reject the nomination by
a simple majority vote of the full Village Board, unless the owner is opposed
to the nomination, in which case designation of the historic landmark may only
occur upon a unanimous vote of the Village Board. In making this determination,
the Village Board shall apply the designation criteria set forth in Section
7-9-4 of this Article and shall give due consideration to the record of the
public hearing(s), and findings and recommendations of the Commission set forth
in the Commission's resolution and report and may take public testimony with
regard to same. Upon a majority vote of the Village Board to approve
designation, the Village Board shall enact an ordinance designating the
historic landmark, which ordinance shall provide that the newly designated
historic landmark shall be subject to the provisions of this Article.
   C.   Upon designation of a historic landmark by the Village Board, the
Commission shall provide written notification by regular and electronic mail to
the owner(s) of record of the designated historic landmark which notification
shall include a copy of the ordinance designating same. Failure to receive
electronic notice shall not invalidate the proceedings of the Commission. The
Village shall file a copy of the designation ordinance with the Cook County
Clerk for each historic landmark designated. A copy of the designation
ordinance shall be sent to the Village Development Customer Services Department
and the Village Clerk.
   D.   If the Board of Trustees does not approve a designation, then a
nomination for the same or a substantially similar historic landmark may not be
considered by the Commission for at least one year from the date of the Village
Board action and the nominated property shall not be considered an eligible
historic landmark during that time.
   E.   Designations may be amended or rescinded by the same procedure and
according to the same criteria set forth in this Article for an original
designation.

   A.   No building permit or demolition permit shall be issued and no
alteration authorized by the Development Customer Services affecting any site,
building, structure or improvement designated in this Article until such time
as the corresponding requirement or requirements set forth in this Article for
each such designated site, building, structure or improvement shall first have
been satisfied:
      1.   In the case of the construction on, and/or the alteration,
relocation, demolition or removal of an eligible historic landmark, the
building or demolition permit shall be issued or the alteration authorized upon
the denial of designation of historic landmark status by the Village Board;
provided, however, that if the site, building, structure or improvement which
has been denied landmark status is located within a designated historic
district, then the issuance of a building or demolition permit shall also be
contingent upon satisfying the requirements set forth in this Article for
property located within a designated historic district; or
      2.   In the case of a demolition or removal of:
         a.   An eligible or designated historic landmark;
         b.   Any site, building, structure or improvement within a designated
historic district; or
         c.   A site, building, structure or improvement located in a
designated historic district or listed in the National Register of Historic
Places, which is wholly or partially financed by the Village or by one or more
Federal, State or Village funding sources which are dispersed through or
administered by the Village, the demolition permit shall be issued upon the
authorization of such a permit by formal resolution of the Village Board as
being necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare; or
      3.   In the case of:
         a.   The construction on, and/or the alteration, relocation,
demolition or removal of an eligible or designated historic landmark;
         b.   The alteration, demolition or removal of a site, building,
structure or improvement located in a designated historic district or listed in
the National Register of Historic Places which is wholly or partially financed
by the Village or by one or more Federal, State or Village funding sources
which are dispersed through or administered by the Village; or
         c.   The removal or demolition of any building, structure or
improvement located within a designated historic district for which demolition
has not been authorized under subsection
7-9-8A2 of this section, the building or demolition permit shall be issued or
the alteration shall be authorized upon the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness in accordance with Section
7-9-12 of this Article or a certificate of economic hardship in accordance with
Section
7-9-13 of this Article.
   B.   No building permit for construction shall be issued by the Development
Customer Services Department affecting any non-landmark property or structure
within a designated historic district unless a certificate of advisory review
is issued in accordance with Section
7-9-15 of this Article.
   C.   The Development Customer Services Department shall provide written
authorization for alteration work affecting eligible or designated historic
landmarks, which does not require a building permit, upon receipt of the
certificate of appropriateness or certificate of economic hardship for such
alteration work. Such authorization must be given prior to commencement of such
alteration work.
   D.   No work requiring the issuance of a building or demolition permit or
the authorization of an alteration by the Development Customer Services
Department, shall commence prior to such issuance or authorization in
accordance with this Section.
   E.   Public works projects within designated historic districts or affecting
eligible or designated historic landmarks shall require a certificate of
advisory review. The Director of Public Works or the Director's designee shall
report such projects to the Commission as they are proposed by the Director or
Director's designee in a timely fashion. In emergency situations, or where time
constraints otherwise require the immediate commencement of such projects, work
may commence prior to the issuance of the certificate of advisory review. (Ord.

reasonable time of submission to the Department, of all applications for zoning
amendments, variances, special use permits, design review applications,

shall evaluate the anticipated effect of the zoning action requested in the
application on the designated historic district or nominated, eligible or
designated historic landmark(s) and shall consider the long-term compatibility
of the proposed zoning action with the character of the affected historic
resources and the effect of any proposed zoning action on the long-range
preservation of these resources. In its review, the Commission shall also
consider the criteria specified in Section
7-9-11  of this Article.
   C.   The Commission may present its evaluation or opinion on the effects of
such anticipated zoning action on a historic district or nominated, eligible or
designated landmark to the board or commission hearing such zoning action.
   D.   In no event shall the provisions of this Section preclude the necessity
of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness or a certificate of economic
hardship when required under Section
7-9-12  or
7-9-13  of this Article. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022;

   A.   The Village Manager shall advise the Commission, in a timely manner, of
all proposed or pending acquisitions, sales or changes in use by the Village or
by any other public agency, including any other unit of local government, when
known to the Village, of any property designated as a historic landmark, or
located within two hundred fifty feet (250') of a landmark, or located in an
historic district. The Commission shall advise the Village Board, other
appropriate public agency or other units of local government, as to the effects
of such actions on the special historic, architectural, community or aesthetic
interest or value of such properties to Oak Park.
   B.   The Commission shall request that other public agencies serving the
community agree to advise the Commission of pending acquisition, sales or
changes by such agencies in use of property designated as an historic landmark
or located within two hundred fifty feet (250') of a landmark, or located in an
historic district, in order that the Commission may advise such agencies as to
the impact of such actions on the historic, architectural, community or
aesthetic interest or value of such properties to Oak Park. The Commission
shall take appropriate steps to notify all public agencies which own or may
acquire property in the Village about the existence and character of designated
historic landmarks and historic districts, and the Commission shall provide a
current record of such landmarks and districts to such public agencies for
their maintenance. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-11: REVIEW CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS; CERTIFICATE OF
ADVISORY REVIEW; NONCONTRIBUTING RESOURCES:
   A.   Guidelines For Construction, Alteration And Relocation Work: In making
a determination to issue or deny a certificate of appropriateness for
construction, alteration or relocation work affecting an eligible or designated
historic landmark, or a determination to conduct an advisory review and either
approve or make recommendations with regard to construction or relocation work
on property located in a designated historic district, either the Commission or
the Village Board, when considering an appeal, shall consider the effect of the
proposed construction, alteration, or relocation on the architectural features
and on the historic, aesthetic or architectural value, characteristics and
significance of the eligible or designated historic landmark or designated
historic district
   B.   In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness or a
certificate of advisory review, the Commission, or the Village Board when
considering an appeal, shall follow the "Secretary of the Interior's
Standards", revised 1990, as amended in this Article, and such other criteria
and guidelines as the Commission may recommend, and which the Village Board may
adopt, for use by the Commission, or the Village Board when considering an
appeal. Such criteria shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      2.   The significant original qualities and/or historic character of a
property shall be retained and preserved. The removal or alteration of historic
or distinctive architectural materials or features and spaces that characterize
a property shall be avoided.
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      4.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      5.   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize an historic property shall be
preserved.
      6.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, inherent
and not renewable color, texture and other visual qualities and, where
possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.
      7.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      8.   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      9.   The historic and architectural integrity of the property and its
environment shall be protected by making the new work compatible with the
existing structures, surrounding structures, streetscape or the character of
the historic district, whenever one or more of these elements is affected by
such work, with respect to the following design criteria:
         a.   The height of the alteration, addition or construction;
         b.   Proportions between the width and height of structure's front
façade;
         c.   The proportions and relationships between doors and windows;
         d.   Relationship of building masses and the open space around them,
including setbacks and placement on the lot;
         e.   The design of the roof shapes, forms and materials;
         f.   Landscaping and appurtenances which should also be sensitive to
the individual structure, its occupants and their needs;
         g.   The scale of the proposed structure;
         h.   Dominant horizontal or vertical directional expression of front
elevation.; and
         i.   Architectural style, design, details and materials, including
textures and patterns, but not necessarily color.
      10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   C.   Guidelines For Removal Or Demolition Of Historic Landmarks, Or
Buildings, Structures Or Improvements Located Within An Historic District:
Guidelines to be used by the Commission, or by the Village Board when
considering an appeal, in determining of appropriateness of the removal or
demolition of a landmark or a building, structure or improvement in an historic
district shall include, but not be limited to, the guidelines set forth in
subsection
7-9-11A of this Section
   D.   Noncontributing Resources: A property or improvement shall be
considered to be a noncontributing resource if it is contained as a
noncontributing resource in the National Register Historic District nomination
form for the historic district. A noncontributing resource is not subject to
the requirements of this Article, except for advisory reviews pursuant to
Section
7-9-15 of this Article or if the resource is listed as an Oak Park Landmark.
(Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-12: PROCEDURES FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS:
   A.   Preapplication: Any owner of an historic landmark may, at any time,
request the Commission to make a preliminary review of proposed work in order
to determine whether the proposed work will meet the criteria set forth in this
Article. The Commission or Committee may, on the basis of documents and other
material presented, make a preliminary finding of acceptability which may then
be used by the Commission to expedite the processing of a certificate of
appropriateness after the owner has applied for a building permit and/or a
certificate of appropriateness. The certificate of appropriateness will be
issued by the Commission only if the work described on the permit documents
submitted by the owner to obtain the permit are found to be substantially the
same as that which was preapproved. If, during the preapplication review, the
Commission or Committee finds that the proposed work does not meet the
criteria, the Commission or Committee may advise the owner on possible ways to
meet the criteria.
   B.   Application: Any application for a building permit and/or certificate
of appropriateness for construction, alteration or relocation affecting an
eligible or designated historic landmark or for the removal of an eligible or
designated historic landmark or the removal of a building, structure or
improvement from a property within a designated historic district and any
application for a demolition permit for the demolition of an eligible or
designated historic landmark or for the demolition of a building, structure or
improvement in a designated historic district shall be sent by the Development
Customer Services Department, within three (3) working days of receipt, to the
Commission. At the time of receipt of the application(s), the Development
Customer Services Department shall issue to the applicant an historic
preservation guidelines pamphlet prepared by the Commission which summarizes
the preservation requirements and preservation assistance available in the
Village with regard to the historic landmarks and historic districts. The
Development Customer Services Department shall not issue a building permit and
shall not authorize any alterations until a certificate of appropriateness or
certificate of economic hardship has been issued.
   C.   Architectural Review Committee And Commission Staff Liaison Review And
Issuance Of Certificate of Appropriateness: The Commission may propose, and the
Village Board may adopt rules, procedures and criteria under which a committee
of the Commission and/or Commission staff liaison may approve applications for
certificates of appropriateness when the proposed work involves:
      1.   Restoration to original conditions;
      2.   No changes in materials;
      3.   Changes not visible from the street and not affecting an interior
landmark; or
      4.   Other types of activities determined by the Commission to have
limited effect on the historic, architectural or aesthetic qualities of
landmarks or districts.
Such rules, procedures and criteria for the above-mentioned limited activities
only, if adopted, shall provide that Commission staff liaison shall act within
five (5) working days from receipt of the application to review, approve and
issue a certificate of appropriateness, refer the application to the
Architectural Review Committee, or refer the application to the full Commission
for its consideration.
   D.   Commission Review: If rules, procedures and criteria are adopted
providing for committee and/or staff issuance of certificates of
appropriateness under certain limited circumstances, applications which would
not meet the criteria for committee or staff review under subsection
7-9-12C of this Section, shall be referred to the Commission by such committee
or Commission staff liaison, or applications which have been denied a
certificate of appropriateness by committee or Commission staff liaison shall
be referred to the Commission. Except as otherwise provided for in rules and
procedures adopted in accordance with subsection
7-9-12C of this Section, all applications for certificates of appropriateness
shall be referred directly to the full Commission for review. The Commission
shall review the completed application and supporting information within forty-
five (45) days of receiving same, either from a committee or directly from the
Development Customer Services Department. The applicant shall be notified, in
writing, of the date, time and place of the meeting at which Commission review
on the proposed work shall take place. The applicant shall be requested to
submit such plans, drawings, photographs or other information the Commission
may request to complete its review. Requested information shall not delay the
meeting. The notice shall be sent no less than five (5) days before the meeting
at which the proposed work is to be reviewed. The requirement for this five (5)
day advance notice may be waived by the applicant. A final vote, as to approval
or denial, shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of a
complete application. If a decision is not made within forty-five (45) days, it
will constitute an automatic withdrawal of the application and the Commission
staff liaison will reschedule the application if appropriate.
   E.   Acceptance Of Proposed Work And Issuance Of Certificate Of
Appropriateness: If, upon review, a quorum of the Commission finds the proposed
work is in accordance with the applicable criteria set forth in Section
7-9-11 of this Article and the purposes of this Article, it may issue a
certificate of appropriateness, with or without conditions reasonably related
to the review guidelines. Notice of the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness shall be provided to the applicant and the Development Customer
Services Department within five (5) working days after the decision. A
certificate of appropriateness shall expire one year after the date of
issuance. Any change in the proposed work after issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness shall require inspection by the Commission staff liaison to
determine whether the work is still in substantial compliance with the
certificate of appropriateness. If staff determines that the change in work is
not in substantial compliance with the certificate of appropriateness, then the
owner must immediately cease work upon notification and submit a revised
application to the Commission for review. The owner may be required to revise
plans and redo work to comply with the certificate of appropriateness. The
owner may dispute conditions regarding a certificate of appropriateness at a
public hearing as set forth below.
   F.   Failure To Issue A Certificate Of Appropriateness: If the Commission
finds that the proposed work does not meet the established criteria and,
therefore, will adversely affect or destroy any significant historic, aesthetic
or architectural feature or value of an eligible or designated historic
landmark, or that the demolition or removal of a building, structure or
improvement in a designated historic district will adversely affect the
historic, aesthetic or architectural character or value of the historic
district or is inappropriate or inconsistent with the spirit and purposes of
this Article, it shall not take action on the application and shall so advise
the applicant and the Development Customer Services Department, in writing,
within five (5) working days of the determination not to act on the application
and shall further indicate to the applicant at that time that the applicant may
submit an amended application for expedited review or may request a public
hearing.
   Within the same five (5) working day time frame, the Commission shall send a
letter to the applicant explaining any changes recommended by the Commission
before an amended application may be considered. The letter will address the
appropriate review criteria and other points deemed pertinent by the
Commission. The applicant may either amend the application and resubmit same
for expedited review, or the applicant may request a public hearing on the
application. If the applicant submits an amended application and it is
determined to conform to Commission recommendations, a certificate of
appropriateness may be issued by a quorum of the Commission.
   G.   Public Hearing Following Denial Of A Certificate Of Appropriateness Or
Disputed Conditions: Within fifteen (15) days of notice to the applicant of
either an approval of a certificate of appropriateness with conditions or to
file an amended application or request a public hearing, the applicant may
request that the Commission hold a public hearing where additional evidence and
testimony may be heard regarding the application for a certificate of
appropriateness. The Commission shall hold such a public hearing within forty-
five (45) days of receipt of the written request.
      1.   Notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing
shall be sent by regular and electronic mail to the applicant and by regular
mail to property owners within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the property
for which the application has been made, and said notice shall also be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village of Oak Park. The
notice shall be sent and published not less than fifteen (15) days nor more
than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing. Such notice shall
include the date, time and place of the hearing, a general description of the
request to be heard, and the address or location of the property to which the
request applies. Failure to receive electronic notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings of the Commission.
      2.   At the public hearing, the Commission shall take testimony presented
by the applicant and any other interested parties concerning the effect of the
proposed alteration, construction, relocation, removal or demolition of an
eligible or designated historic landmark upon an eligible or designated
historic landmark and the surrounding neighborhood or the effect of the
proposed removal or demolition of any structure, building or improvement within
an historic district upon the district, and shall conduct such hearings in a
manner consistent with the Rules of Procedure for Hearings before the Historic
Preservation Commission, as amended from time to time, which are, adopted
pursuant to this Article and made a part hereof and as may be amended, from
time to time, by action of the Commission and the Village Board. The hearing
may be continued to a date certain, with the concurrence of the applicant.
      3.   Within fifteen (15) days following the completion of the public
hearing, the Commission shall issue or deny the certificate of appropriateness
or modify or keep intact conditions of approval related thereto. Notice of the
Commission's decision will be sent to the applicant and owner and the
Development Customer Services Department within five (5) working days of
rendering the decision. Notification procedures outlined under Sections
7-9-6 and
7-9-7 of this Article will apply.
   H.   Appeal To The Village Board: Upon denial of the application for a
certificate of appropriateness by the Commission or denial of a request to
modify conditions related thereto, the applicant may either appeal the denial
to the Village Board or may request a certificate of economic hardship. (Ord.
1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022; Ord. 24-163, 12-3-2024)
7-9-13: PROCEDURES FOR CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP:
   A.   Application: Following denial of a certificate of appropriateness by
the Commission or by the Village Board on appeal, the owner or designated
representative may apply for a certificate of economic hardship by submitting
to the Commission a completed application for a certificate of economic
hardship, which form shall be available in the Village Hall and in particular,
at Development Customer Services Department.
   B.   Public Hearing Process: The Commission shall hold a public hearing
within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a completed application for a
certificate of economic hardship. Notice of the public hearing shall be sent by
regular and electronic mail to the applicant and by regular mail to property
owners within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the property for which
application has been made. Notice also shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village of Oak Park. The notice shall be sent not
less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of
the hearing. Such notice shall include the date, time and place of the hearing,
a general description of the contents of the request to be heard and the
address or location of the property to which the request applies. Failure to
receive electronic notice shall not invalidate the proceedings of the
Commission.
At the public hearing, the Commission shall take testimony presented by the
owner(s) and any other interested parties concerning the effect of the proposed
alteration, construction, relocation, removal or demolition of an eligible or
designated historic landmark or removal or demolition of a building, structure
or improvement within a designated historic district based upon the criteria
set forth in Section
7-9-11 of this Article and shall conduct such hearing in a manner consistent
with the rules of procedure for hearings before the Commission. The hearing may
be continued to a date certain. A record shall be kept of all proceedings.
   C.   Standards For Commission Decision And Factors To Be Considered: The
Commission shall issue a certificate of economic hardship only if the
Commission finds that the subject property cannot be put to any reasonably
beneficial use or that the owner/applicant will suffer a substantial economic
loss thereon without the alteration, construction, relocation, removal or
demolition being sought by the owner/applicant and that the owner/applicant is
not responsible in any way for the hardship from which he or she is seeking
relief. The factors to be considered by the Commission and the Village Board on
the issue of economic hardship shall include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      1.   A substantial decrease in the fair market value of the property as a
result of the denial of the certificate of appropriateness;
      2.   A substantial decrease in the pretax or after-tax return to owners
of record or other investors in the property as a result of the denial of the
certificate of appropriateness;
      3.   The cost of the proposed construction, alteration, relocation or
demolition, and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to
comply with the recommendations of the Commission for changes necessary for the
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness;
      4.   The structural soundness of any structures on the property and their
suitability for rehabilitation;
      5.   The economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing
structure or improvement on the property in the case of a proposed demolition.
      6.   The owner/applicant's purchase of the subject property after the
enactment of the relevant provisions of this Article without making said
purchase contingent upon the owner/applicant first obtaining necessary Board
and/or Commission approvals under the this Article shall be deemed to be
conclusive evidence of the fact that the applicant is responsible for the
applicant's own economic hardship, if any.
   D.   Evidence: The Commission may solicit expert testimony. The applicant
may be required to submit evidence at the hearing to support any of the
factors, including those listed above, which the applicant believes to have
contributed to the economic hardship which the applicant alleges he or she
would suffer if the applicant is not granted a certificate of appropriateness.
Specific information and documentation which should be presented by the
applicant as competent evidence at the hearing shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
      1.   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the party
from whom purchased (including description of the relationship, if any, between
the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased);
      2.   The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon according to
the two (2) most recent assessments;
      3.   Real estate taxes for the previous two (2) years;
      4.   Annual debt service, if any, for the previous two (2) years;
      5.   All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the
owner or applicant in connection with the owner or applicant's purchase,
financing or ownership of the property;
      6.   Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers
received, if any;
      7.   Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses for
the property;
      8.   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two (2) years, itemized operating and maintenance
expenses for the previous two (2) years, and annual cash flow, if any, during
the same period;
      9.   Executed construction agreements or proposals;
      10.   Engineering or architect reports on the structural integrity of the
building or structure upon which work is being proposed.
In the event that any of the required information is not reasonably available
to the applicant and cannot be obtained by the applicant, the applicant shall
provide to the Commission a statement of the information which cannot be
obtained and describe the reasons why such information cannot be obtained.
   E.   Issuance Or Denial Of Certificate of Economic Hardship:
      1.   If the Commission finds that the owner/applicant has not established
that the owner/applicant will suffer a demonstrable economic hardship as a
result of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness, then the Commission
shall deny the applicant's application for a certificate of economic hardship.
      2.   If the Commission makes an initial determination that the applicant
has presented a case which may establish that without approval of the proposed
work all reasonable use of, or return from, a designated historic landmark or
building, structure, or improvement within a designated historic district will
be denied a property owner, but the Commission finds that reasonable
alternatives may exist which should be addressed by the applicant, then the
application shall be delayed for a period of no more than sixty (60) days
following the finding. During the first thirty (30) days of this period, the
Commission shall investigate plans and make recommendations to the owner and
Village Board which are intended to provide for reasonable use of, or return
from the property, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. During the
second thirty (30) days of this period, the applicant will investigate the
proposal of the Commission and provide the Commission with written response
thereto.
      3.   If, at the end of this sixty (60) day period, after reviewing its
initial finding and its subsequent proposals and the applicant's response
thereto, the Commission finds that without approval of the proposed work the
property cannot be put to any reasonable use or the owner cannot obtain a
reasonable economic return, then the Commission shall issue a certificate of
economic hardship approving the proposed work. If the Commission finds
otherwise, it shall deny the application for a certificate of economic
hardship. Within fifteen (15) days following the completion of the public
hearing and within fifteen (15) days of the sixty (60) day delay period
provided for in subsection
7-9-13E of this Section, if applicable, the Commission shall render its
decision on the certificate of economic hardship by adopting a resolution which
shall set forth the findings of fact and decision of the Commission either
granting or denying the certificate of economic hardship.
      4.   An executed copy of the resolution shall be sent to the applicant
and property owner and the Development Customer Services Department within five
(5) working days after the decision. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8,
2-7-2022)
7-9-14: APPEALS:

of appropriateness or a certificate of economic hardship by the Commission, the
applicant and/or the applicant's representative may appeal the Commission's

affected departments of the Village government.
   C.   The failure of the Village Board to affirm, modify or reverse the
decision of the Commission within forty-five (45) days of the applicant filing
an appeal shall be considered as an affirmance by the Village Board of the
decision of the Commission and a denial of the appeal, and the Commission shall
so notify the applicant and the affected departments of the Village government
The decision of the Village Board will be the final administrative decision of
the Village. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-15: ADVISORY REVIEW PROCEDURES:
   A.   Application For Advisory Review:
      1.   Advisory review is provided by the Commission as a service to the
public. Any owner may, at any time, consult with the Commission to determine
whether intended work on a structure may comply with the review guidelines and
seek the Commission's advice on how best to accomplish the work to comply with
them.
      2.   Except as otherwise provided by rules and procedures adopted in
accordance with subsection 7-9-15B of this Section, any application for a
building permit for construction or relocation work on a property within a
historic district other than historic landmarks, government-funded projects and
structures intended to be demolished (which receive certificate of
appropriateness reviews as outlined above), shall be sent to Commission staff
by the Development Customer Services Department. The Development Customer
Services Department shall not issue a building permit until the Commission,
Architectural Review Committee, and/or Commission staff, have reviewed the
permit application and acted, or until the passage of thirty (30) days from the
filing of the said application, whichever occurs first.
   B.   Architectural Review Committee And Commission Liaison Staff Review And
Approval: The Commission may propose and the Village Board may approve rules,
procedures and criteria under which a committee of the Commission, or the
Commission staff liaison, may review applications for advisory review when the
proposed work involves: 1) restoration to original conditions, or 2) no changes
in materials, or 3) changes not visible the street, or 4) other types of
activities determined by the Commission to have limited effect on the historic,
architectural or aesthetic qualities of the structure. Such committee or
Commission staff liaison shall take one of the following actions within five
(5) days from receipt of the application from the Development Customer Services
Department:
      1.   Review the permit application return to the Development Customer
Services Department marked: "approved";
      2.   Request that the owner meet with the review committee to receive
suggestions concerning revisions to the proposed work which will bring it in
line with review criteria. As soon as possible, but no later than ten (10) days
after the meeting, staff will provide a review summary and confirmation to the
applicant and will mark the permit as "approved" for historic review. At this
point the applicant is free to either revise the applicant's plans in
accordance with the suggested changes and proceed with the permit process
without changes.; and
      3.   Meet with the owner and/or submit the permit application and project
description to the full Commission to review at its next regularly scheduled
meeting.
   C.   Commission Review: Applications which have been referred to the
Commission either directly from the Development Customer Services Department or
indirectly through the committee or Commission staff, liaison shall be reviewed
by the full Commission within thirty (30) days of receipt of the complete

place of the meeting at which a review of the proposed work shall take place.
The applicant may be requested to submit plans, drawings, photographs or other
information to enable the Commission to conduct a more complete review. The
Commission may, at that meeting, make recommendations concerning revisions to
the proposed work which will bring the work into conformity with review
criteria set forth in Section
7-9-11 of this Article. These recommendations will be forwarded, in writing, to
the applicant as soon as possible after this meeting, but no later than ten
(10) days after the meeting, and the application for permit will be marked as
"approved" for historic review. At this point, the applicant is free to either
revise the plans in accordance with the suggested changes and submit them to
the Development Customer Services Department, or to submit them without change,
and the permit will be issued if the application is otherwise in compliance
with Village Code. The Commission may delay issuance of the permit by a period
of no longer than thirty (30) days from time of its receipt of the complete
permit application in an attempt to resolve nonconformity issues with regard to
the review criteria. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-16: PREVENTION OF DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT:
The Commission, on its own initiative, may file a petition with the Development
Customer Services Department requesting that the Department require correction
of defects or repairs to eligible or designated historic landmarks or
buildings, structures or improvements in designated historic districts so that
such landmarks, buildings, structures or improvements shall be preserved and
protected in accordance with the purposes of this Article. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-

7-9-17: HAZARDOUS STRUCTURES AND PUBLIC NUISANCES:
   A.   This Article shall not prohibit the demolition of any structure which
poses an immediate hazard to human health and safety. When an eligible or
designated historic landmark or building, structure or improvement in a
designated historic district requires immediate demolition due to its imminent
threat to human health and safety and an authorized Village official, pursuant
to ordinance, has made the determination that the landmark, building, structure
or improvement should be demolished immediately, then nothing in this Article
shall prohibit the demolition of such landmark, building, structure or
improvement. The Village official ordering the demolition shall, prior to
causing the demolition, attempt notification of the Commission and Commission
staff liaison, of the imminent threat posed by the landmark, building,
structure or improvement if such notice may be given without jeopardizing human
health and safety.
   B.   If the Village has, pursuant to official action, declared a building,
structure or improvement that is an eligible or designated landmark or is
located in a designated historic district as a public nuisance and has
authorized its demolition, the Village Manager or the Village Manager's
designee shall have a copy of the declaration of public nuisance delivered to
the chairperson of the Commission and Commission staff liaison, who shall place
the matter on the agenda of the next meeting of the Commission. The Commission
shall be authorized to review the building, structure or improvement and
determine if the owner or some other person can commence rehabilitation of it
immediately. The Commission shall ensure that whoever will rehabilitate the
building, structure or improvement shall have either public or private
financing, or both, to make sure that the building, structure or improvement is
promptly rehabilitated in accordance with the criteria set forth in this
Article. If the Commission is unable to secure the rehabilitation of the
building, structure or improvement within ninety (90) days of the date that it
was declared a public nuisance by the Village or by the date the Village
obtains judicial authorization to demolish it, whichever is later, then the
Village may proceed with the demolition of the building, structure or
improvement.
   C.   An owner of a building, structure or improvement eligible or designated
as a landmark or located within a historic district shall not be authorized to
demolish such building, structure or improvement without filing an application
for and obtaining a certificate of appropriateness or certificate of economic
hardship, except when an authorized Village official, pursuant to ordinance, or
has made the determination that the building, structure or improvement poses an
imminent threat to human health and safety and should be demolished
immediately.
   D.   If the Village has declared an eligible or designated landmark or a
building, structure or improvement in a designated historic district to be a
public nuisance and, after such declaration, the owner of the building,
structure or improvement files an application for a certificate of
appropriateness so the building, structure or improvement may be rehabilitated,
the Commission may exercise jurisdiction over the application and the structure
until such time as the Village obtains judicial authorization to demolish the
structure. Once the Village has obtained such judicial authorization, then the
rehabilitation of the structure may proceed only if the Village Board consents
to withholding its authority to demolish the structure in abeyance while the
structure is rehabilitated. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-18: HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBILITY PROVISIONS:
Nothing in this Article shall exempt owners from complying with applicable
Federal, State or Village laws concerning handicapped accessibility. In
providing for handicapped accessibility as may be required by such laws or
desired by an owner, every effort shall be made to visually integrate such
physical devices as may be necessary to accomplish accessibility with the
architectural design of the historic landmark or building, structure or
improvement in a historic district. Emphasis shall be placed on providing
readily removable physical accessibility provisions such as ramps or chair
lifts, with no permanent damage to the historic fabric of the building. (Ord.
1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-19: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to alter, relocate, remove or
demolish any historic landmark or to do construction work on, relocate, remove
or demolish any building, structure or improvement within an historic district,
or attempt to take any of these actions without complying with the provisions
of this Article. Persons violating any provision of this Article other than
mandatory advisory review shall also be subject to the institution of
proceedings by the Village to prevent, restrain, abate or correct such
violations of this Article, including restoration of the building or structure
and its site to its appearance prior to the violation if such appearance is
integral to the significance of the site or structure as determined by the
Commission. Any action to enforce this Section shall be brought by the Village
Attorney, the Village Attorney's designee or by designated representatives of
the Village Manager. This civil remedy shall be in addition to and not in lieu
of any criminal prosecution and penalty contained in this Section.
   B.   If construction, alteration, relocation, removal or demolition of an
eligible or designated historic landmark or of any building, structure or
improvement, located in a designated historic district occurs without a permit
or without proper authorization as set forth in this Article, then the Village
may seek to revoke the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or
its or his/her successors' interest in performing such construction,
alteration, relocation, removal or demolition for a period of one year.
   C.   If demolition of an historic landmark occurs without a permit, the
person causing such demolition shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor offense punishable by incarceration in the County jail for a term
not to exceed six (6) months.
   D.   Any person violating any provision of this Article shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).
Each day during which any violation hereof is committed shall constitute a
separate offense. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-2022)
7-9-20: JUDICIAL REVIEW OF FINAL DECISION:
Any final decisions rendered by the Village Board under this Article shall be
subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative
Review Law, 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., as amended, and
rules adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 1999-0-7, 3-15-99; amd. Ord. 22-8, 2-7-

   A.   Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this article, the
Director shall evaluate all buildings in the Village which he or she believes
to be unoccupied on or after the effective date of this article and make a
determination for each as to whether the building is a "vacant building" within
the meaning of section
7-10-3 of this article. The Director may determine that a building which meets
any of the criteria set forth in the definition of "vacant building" in section
7-10-3 of this article is not to be regulated under this article for a stated
period, if upon consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient
evidence, he or she determines that the circumstances which give rise to the
building being eligible for regulation hereunder are clearly temporary in
nature and are either in the process of being addressed or will soon be
addressed by the owner and that therefore regulation of the building under this
article would not serve the public health, welfare, and safety and makes
written findings in support of his or her decision. The determination shall be
in writing and shall state the factual basis for the determination. For
buildings the Director determines to be "vacant buildings", he or she shall,
within seven (7) days of making that determination, send notice of his/her
written determination with the factual findings to the name and address of the
last taxpayer of record for such parcel listed on the most recent Cook County
tax roll. Said notice of determination shall be sent first class United States
mail, with proper postage prepaid. Failure of delivery shall not excuse a
person from complying with this article. The Director may personally serve or
cause personal service of the notice of determination. Any person making such
service shall execute an affidavit attesting to the facts of service. The
Director shall maintain an affidavit of such mailing for each notice of
determination sent.
   B.   The Director shall cause a comprehensive inspection of the interior of
all "vacant buildings" to determine compliance with Village property
maintenance, building, health, fire, water and sewer codes.
   C.   The notice of determination shall set a tentative date and time for the
code compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building to determine
the extent of compliance with Village property maintenance, building, health,
fire, water and sewer codes. After receipt of the notice of determination, if
the owner does not appeal the determination, the owner shall either confirm the
tentative date for the inspection or shall schedule a new date and time for
same. If the owner fails to confirm the tentative date and time for the
inspection or refuses to schedule or permit the inspection it shall be the
responsibility of the Village to obtain an administrative search warrant to
accomplish the inspection.
   D.   The Village shall charge the owner a fee of five hundred dollars
($500.00) to offset the cost to the Village of said inspection. The owner shall
pay the inspection fee to the Village within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
bill for same.
   E.   Village real estate transfer stamps will not be issued by the Village
for the sale of such property until such inspection has taken place and the fee
therefor has been paid and, if necessary, an administrative search warrant for
same has been timely obtained. Such stamps shall be issued if the Village is
required to obtain an administrative search warrant and fails to obtain same in
a timely manner.
   F.   The notice of determination shall contain a statement of the
obligations of the owner of a building determined to be a vacant building, a
copy of the registration form the owner is required to file pursuant to section
7-10-6 of this article, and a notice of the owner's right to appeal the
Director's determination. (Ord. 15-183, 11-2-2015)
7-10-5: APPEAL OF DIRECTOR'S DETERMINATION OF "VACANT BUILDINGS":
   A.   An owner of a building determined by the Director to be a vacant
building as provided for in this article may appeal that determination to the
Village Manager. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the
Village Manager within fifteen (15) days of the date of mailing of the notice
of determination. The filing of an appeal stays the owner's obligation to
register his or her building as required by section
7-10-6 of this article. The appeal shall contain a complete statement of the
reasons the owner disputes the Director's determination, shall set forth
specific facts in support thereof, and shall include all evidence the owner
relies upon to support the appeal. The Village Manager shall decide the appeal
on the basis of facts presented by the owner in his or her written appeal and
the Director's written determination.
   B.   The burden is upon the owner to present sufficient evidence to persuade
the Village Manager that it is more likely than not that the subject building
is not a "vacant building" within the meaning of this article.
   C.   The Village Manager shall send written notice of his or her decision to
the owner within ten (10) days of his or her receipt of the appeal. The Village
Manager may, but is not required to, seek additional information from the
owner. The Village Manager may, upon written notice thereof to the owner, take
no more than ten (10) additional days, to decide the appeal if he or she
determines that such additional time is required for consideration of the
appeal.
   D.   An owner who wishes to challenge applicability of this article to his/
her building without the Director's determination having been made, shall set
forth specific facts to support nonapplicability in a writing to the Director.
In the event the Director determines that the subject building is a "vacant
building", the owner shall have the right to appeal the Director's
determination to the Village Manager as provided for herein. (Ord. 15-183, 11-
2-2015)

or the owner of a building whose appeal from the Director's determination has
been denied by the Village Manager, shall take the actions provided for in this
section within fifteen (15) days after either the date of Director's notice of
determination or occurrence of the facts which would cause a reasonable person

            (3)   File an amended registration within fifteen (15) days of any
change in the information contained in the annual registration. A new
registration is required for any change in ownership whatsoever.
         d.   Registration does not exonerate the owner from compliance with

compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building and the owner
shall pay a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fee to the Village to defray the

reinspections shall take place, as necessary, until code compliance is
achieved. Timely code compliance is required.

being secured by conventional methods used in the design of the building or by
methods permitted for new construction of similar type with board removed.
Boarding shall be accomplished with materials and methods described by the
Director and available from the Director. The owner shall maintain the building
in an enclosed and secure state until the building is reoccupied or made
available for immediate occupancy. If the owner demonstrates that securing of
the building will provide adequate protection to the public, the Director may
waive the requirement of an enclosure.
         b.   For buildings and/or premises which are determined by the
Director as being or containing public nuisances, as defined in section
7-10-3 of this article, then the vacant building/premises plan shall contain a

boarded building, and two (2) years, in the case of a vacant, unboarded, and
code compliant building will be approved, except that the Director may approve
an extension of the time during which the building will be unoccupied beyond
two (2) years to a date certain but then only based upon clear and documented

hazard, is otherwise dangerous to human life or the public welfare, involves
illegal or improper use, occupancy, or maintenance, under such conditions that
securing the building is insufficient to prevent the actual or threatened harm.
      6.   Additional Information Posted: Affix to any building which is
boarded, a two foot by two foot (2' x 2') sign compliant with the Village's

   L.   Each machine used in this activity shall be checked daily and at all
times properly maintained and kept in a safe condition for public use.
8-16-4: EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS; AUTOMATIC DRY CLEANING ESTABLISHMENTS:
   A.   Vents: The machines shall be completely enclosed by a cabinet. The
cabinet shall be provided with vents at or near the bottom and connected to
exhaust ventilation adequate to prevent the escape of vapor to the surrounding
area, unless the installation is so constructed as to have no air flow through
the partition between the customer and service area. The exhaust vent
connection shall be located at or near the top of the cabinet.
   B.   Exhaust System: The cleaning equipment must be provided with an exhaust
system capable of maintaining a minimum of one hundred feet (100') per minute
face velocity through the loading door whenever the door is open. The duct-work
connections from this system must be sealed (soldered or taped) and the
discharge stack extended to a minimum height two feet (2') above the roof line.
The discharge stack shall be extended two feet (2') above the level of any
windows located within fifty feet (50') of the opening, and shall be located
horizontally at a safe distance from any fresh air intakes for gas or
electrically fired equipment such as dryers, water heaters or building heating
plants. All exhausts from the machines and area occupied by the machines shall
have a separate duct system and discharge to the atmosphere.
   C.   Interlocks: An interlock system must be provided on the machine to
prevent the loading door from being opened during the normal cycle. This system
may be either electrical and/or mechanical and so connected as to protect
against the event of power failure.
   D.   Vapor Odors: The cleaning cycle controls shall be such that there will
be no odors of solvent or solvent vapor in the material being cleaned when it
is removed from the machine at the end of the cycle.
   E.   Doors: The machines shall be equipped with transparent doors or ports
to allow visual inspection and determination of the status of the cleaning
cycle.
   F.   Water Supply: If the machine is connected to a potable water supply, it
shall be equipped with an air gap or properly installed vacuum breaker in the
water supply line upstream for the condenser. There shall be no control valves
downstream from the vacuum breaker. The waste water shall discharge through an
air gap.
   G.   Fluids: Fluids used in cleaning procedures shall be of nonflammable and
nonexplosive types of mixtures, and the units shall be so designed that the
user of equipment may not come in contact with the raw cleaning fluid.
8-16-5: EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION; AUTOMATIC DRY CLEANING ESTABLISHMENTS:
The equipment shall be installed such that only the front of the machine shall
be exposed in the customer area. The working or maintenance portion of the
equipment should be separated from the front of the machine by a solid
partition. As a means of minimizing any solvent or vapor buildup in the
customer area and also to control any minor solvent leakage, it is required
that there be a minimum air flow rate from the customer area through the
partition as follows:
 
No. of     Minimum Air Flow Rate
Machines   Per Machine (cfm)1  
1 - 3      500
4 - 8      400
9 - 16     375
17 or more 360
 
1 Each cleaning cell shall constitute one machine.
The exhaust ventilation as described above shall be provided on a continuous
basis while the establishment is open for business. The fan wiring shall be
such that the dry cleaning equipment cannot be operated unless the fan system
is in operation.
Where grille openings are to be installed in the partition to facilitate air
movement, they should be sized on the basis of about five hundred (500) cfm per
square foot of net grille area and should be placed as close to the machine as
possible. An example would be the use of a thirty inch by six inch (30" x 6")
grille located directly over a machine.
A supply of tempered make-up air shall be provided for the customer service
area in an amount approximately equal to the exhaust ventilation required in
the table on minimum air flow rate per machine in this Section. The device
shall be capable of providing the above amount of make-up air at room design
temperature with an outside air temperature equal to the mean winter
temperature. In all cases it is required that the exhaust rate be slightly
greater than the make-up rate which will at all times maintain a slight
negative pressure in the customer service area.
Access doors to the maintenance area shall be kept locked.
Where there is no air flow through the partition between the customer and
service area, the exhaust ventilation required in the table on minimum air flow
rate per machine in this Section is sufficient provided that it is operated
continuously with a satisfactory source of tempered make-up air in the service
area. The volume of make-up air provided in the service area should be slightly
less than the exhaust capacity in order that a slight negative pressure be
maintained in the service area at all times. A supply of suitably tempered
make-up air should be supplied for the customer area.
Auxiliary Fan -- Where there is air flow between the customer and the service
area, it is also required that a general ventilation fan be installed in the
back room or maintenance area to be used in case of serious solvent leakage.
This fan may be installed in the rear wall and when combined with the system
required in this Section should enable the exhausting of twice the amount of
air required in the table on minimum air flow rate per machine in this Section.
Prevention of Leaks -- A satisfactory means of preventing liquid leaks from
escaping the enclosure must be provided. The floor of the enclosure or machine
base shall be diked so as to hold a liquid volume equal to the maximum quantity
of solvent which might possibly escape from machines in the system. A method
shall be provided for draining and containing solvent in the event of a leak.
Tanks so provided for containing leaks shall be vented to the outside.
In lieu of the diking aforesaid, the integral pan and piping system may be used
provided that the piping system is connected to a properly sized and vented
holding tank as described above.
Use as Dwelling -- Equipment shall not be installed in a building occupied
solely as a dwelling place.
Plans -- Any person establishing an automatic dry cleaning establishment shall
be required to submit to the Director of Building and Zoning a complete set of
plans and specifications of the building in which such dry cleaning
establishment is to be located and also a complete diagram of the floor plan of
each room to be occupied, correctly showing the area of all machinery and
ventilating equipment to be installed therein.
8-16-6: OPERATION; AUTOMATIC DRY CLEANING ESTABLISHMENTS:
   A.   Attendant: Automatic dry cleaning establishments may not be operated
unless an attendant is on the premises at all times when such equipment is
available for use by the public. Such attendant shall be trained and well
qualified in the procedures relative to the safe operation of such equipment.
The attendant as well as the owner shall be responsible for the enforcement of
the provisions of this Article.
   B.   Instructions: In addition to the general machine operating instructions
required by
8-16-3K there shall be posted a warning to the effect that garments or
materials bearing the odor of the solvent are dangerous if enclosed in an
automobile or other tightly enclosed place.
   C.   Warning Signs: Signs shall be posted requesting evacuation of the
establishment in the presence of noticeable vapor odor or in the presence of
such symptoms as irritation of the eyes, nose or throat, lacrimation or
dizziness.
   D.   Age of Operator: No person under the age of sixteen (16) years shall be
permitted to operate any automatic dry cleaning machine.
   E.   Hours of Operation: No automatic dry cleaning establishment shall be
operated between the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00)
A.M.
8-16-7: MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS; AUTOMATIC DRY CLEANING ESTABLISHMENTS:
   A.   Exhausts: Servicing of the machines shall be done only during operation
of all exhaust ventilation functions required in Section
8-16-5 of this Article.
   B.   Storage: The solvent shall be stored in closed containers, and should
be transferred from the containers in a line free of leaks. All storage
facilities for solvent, external from the equipment, must be adequately and
properly labeled.
   C.   Residues: Filter residue and other residues containing solvent shall be
disposed of so as not to create a health hazard or nuisance. A covered metal
container shall be used for temporary storage outside the building.
   D.   Protective Equipment: Respiratory protective equipment shall be
provided for maintenance personnel and must be kept in good repair and
available for immediate use. Chemical cartridge respirators are approved for
light solvent concentrations and the wearer should replace the cartridges
immediately upon noting odor.
Safety goggles, rubber gloves and rubber safety aprons shall be provided for
the use of the service personnel.

   K.   For the purposes of inspection and the determination of license type
only, each common area set forth herein shall be considered a separate unit.
Any part of a building not exclusively available to an individual tenant shall
be considered a common area including, but not limited to, building exterior,

separate common area shall be considered a separate unit for the purpose of
determining license eligibility. Each stairway shall be considered a separate
unit, but shall not be separated by flight.
   L.   Properties for which a rental license is not required due to new
construction or a change from owner occupied to rental will qualify for a
silver license. Properties found operating without a valid rental license from
the Village or failing to meet code requirements or that have been the subject
of an enforcement action(s) such as a violation of this article, shall only
qualify for a conditional license.
   M.   All rental properties are subject to review by the Village Manager or
the Manager's designee and an owner may be required to apply and qualify for a
different license type based on a property's compliance with this code and any
other applicable laws or regulations. Based on such review, the Manager may
require an owner to apply for, and meet the terms of, a conditional license if
the Manager determines that the nature of applicable property and nuisance
violations, pursuant to section
7-13-1 et seq., and chapter 16 of this code, are so severe that they require an
increased level of monitoring and an urgent need for compliance. The Manager
may determine that such a requirement is warranted even if the number of
violations per unit is equal to, or less than, three (3) as set forth for a
conditional license in subsection
12-2-1J of this section.
   N.   At any time during a license period, if a rental property does not meet
or exceed the criteria established for the current license type, the license
may be reviewed by the Village Manager and may be subject to suspension,
revocation, and/or license type review. Violations identified by inspections
other than those conducted for the purpose of license issue or renewal shall
only be included in the calculation of violations per unit, as described in
subsection
12-2-1J of this section, if they are not corrected before a citation is issued.
   O.   Rental properties for which a conditional license has been issued must
meet the requirements set forth in subsection
12-2-1P of this section.
   P.   Buildings containing three (3) rental dwelling units or fewer shall
only qualify for a small rental license type and only be subject to the license
and crime free housing requirements set forth in this section and section
12-2-12 of this article and shall not be subject to the inspection requirements
and mandatory lease provisions set forth in sections
12-2-6,
12-2-7,
12-2-9,
12-2-10 and
12-2-11 of this article except as otherwise provided. Buildings containing four
(4) or more rental dwelling units (multiple-family dwelling) shall be subject

forth in sections 1
12-2-6,
12-2-7,
12-2-9,
12-2-10 and
12-2-11 of this article.
   Q.   A license shall be required for buildings containing three (3) or fewer
rental dwelling units beginning January 1, 2015.
   R.   Rental properties that meet the conditional license criteria set forth
in this section are eligible only for conditional licenses. The Village should
provide by mail to each licensee a monthly report of any police and fire calls
and incidents and applicable property and nuisance violations defined in
section
7-13-1 et seq., and chapter 16 of this code.
      1.   Mitigation Plan: An applicant for a conditional license must submit
for review by the Village Manager or the Manager's designee a mitigation plan
for the license period. The mitigation plan shall describe steps proposed by
the applicant to reduce the number of property and nuisance violations, defined
in section
7-13-1 et seq., and chapter 16 of this code to a level that qualifies for a
gold, silver, or bronze license.
      2.   Village Manager Consideration: A license application that contains a
proposed mitigation plan shall be presented to the Village Manager or the
Manager's designee as to the disposition thereof. After giving the applicant an
opportunity to be heard and present evidence, the Manager shall approve,
disapprove, or approve with conditions the application and the mitigation plan.
If the Manager disapproves an application and mitigation plan or approves it
with conditions, the Manager shall state the reasons for so doing in writing.
In evaluating a mitigation plan, the Manager shall consider, among other
things, the building, its management practices, the nature and seriousness of
property and nuisance violations as defined in section 7-13-1 et seq., and
chapter 16 of this code, and the expected effectiveness of measures identified
in the plan to reduce the number of property and nuisance violations. In
evaluating a mitigation plan submitted by an applicant operating under a
provisional license, the Manager shall also consider the effectiveness of
measures identified in the applicant's previous mitigation plan and the need
for different or additional measures to reduce the property and nuisance
violations.
      3.   Compliance With Mitigation Plan: The licensee shall comply with the
mitigation plan as approved or modified by the Village Manager. No later than
the tenth day after each calendar month, the licensee shall mail or deliver to
the Village Manager a written report describing all steps taken in furtherance
of the applicant's mitigation plan during the preceding month. (Ord. 16-088, 7-
18-2016, eff. 9-1-2016)
12-2-2: LICENSE APPLICATION:

Village Manager or the Manager's designee. Such application shall be received
not less than thirty (30) days prior to the initial date of issuance as
determined by the Village Manager or the Manager's designee, or not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of a currently valid license. The
application shall set forth, but not be limited to, the following information:
   A.   Name and address of legal owner.
   B.   If licensee designates an agent, then the application shall set forth

janitor and any other persons in addition to the owner or manager in a position
of authority with regard to the subject property.
   D.   The designation of the agent authorized by the owner to accept notices
and process.
   E.   It is the policy of the Board of Trustees to prevent discrimination
against any person on the basis of race in the rental of multiple-family
dwellings in the Village. In order to prevent owners or their agents from
renting multiple-family dwellings on the basis of the race of the lessee, it is
essential for the Village to monitor statistical data of the demographics of
tenant manager occupied units on a periodic basis. At least once a year, the
Village Manager or the Manager's designee shall present a report to the Board
of Trustees analyzing survey data compiled by the United States census bureau.
At a minimum, the report shall describe the racial and ethnic makeup of renter
occupied households and the type of structures in which those households are
located. The report shall also include a map depicting any racial or ethnic
segregation of renter occupied households in the most (smallest) geographic
detail as made available annually by the United States census bureau. The
report and underlying data shall be made available on the Village website to
the general public.
   F.   No license application shall be considered for a multi-family
residential building with four (4) or more rental units unless the building has
been inspected pursuant to section
12-2-6 of this article no more than ninety (90) days prior to Village receipt
of the application. The results of said inspection shall determine the type of

the terms "tenant," "manufactured home" or "mobile home," "lot," and "mobile
home park," are defined or used in the Mobile Home Landlord and Tenant Rights
Act, 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 745/1 et seq.;

for a dwelling unit and is directly responsible to the utility company, the

landlord shall disclose to the tenant in the rental agreement the annual cost
of service from the utility providing the primary service during the previous
twelve (12) months, if known.

for a dwelling unit to the landlord, the landlord shall disclose to the tenant
in the rental agreement the annual cost of service from the utility providing
the primary service during the previous twelve (12) months. If the landlord did
not own the dwelling unit during the previous twelve (12) months or did not pay
the utility costs to the utility provider on behalf of the tenant during the
previous twelve (12) months, the landlord may satisfy this requirement by
providing cost of service for a similar dwelling unit, if known, or disclose to
the tenant that the utility costs are unknown to the landlord.
      4.   When the landlord charges a move-in fee, the landlord shall provide
the tenant with an itemized list of the landlord's reasonable estimate of the
costs that comprise the move-in fee and shall not charge the tenant moving into
the premises for costs associated with routine maintenance and the upkeep of
the premises.
   C.   Tenant Right to Dwelling that Materially Complies with Habitability:
      1.   A tenant shall have the right to a dwelling that materially complies
with habitability and shall have the right to a remedy when the property is not
in material compliance with habitability standards.
      2.   The landlord tenant may use the 2009 International Property
Maintenance Code as adopted by the Village pursuant to section

Maintenance Code, as adopted by the Village pursuant to section
7-13-2 ("Amendments") of this Code, as amended.
   E.   Tenant Right to Exclusive Possession and to be Free from Unlawful
Entry.
      1.   If the landlord fails to deliver possession of the dwelling unit to
the tenant in compliance with the rental agreement, rent abates until the
landlord delivers possession and the tenant may:
         a.   Upon written notice to the landlord, terminate the rental
agreement and, upon termination, the landlord shall return within forty-eight
(48) hours all security deposits; or
         b.   Demand performance of the rental agreement and, if the tenant
elects, the tenant may maintain an action for possession of the dwelling unit
against the landlord or any person wrongfully in possession and recover the
damages sustained by the tenant.
         2.   An aggrieved person may recover from the person withholding
possession an amount not more than two (2) months' rent or twice the actual
damages sustained by them, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney's
fees.
         3.   If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an
unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful, but
which have the effect of harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive
relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct, or terminate the rental
agreement. In each case, the tenant may recover an amount equal to not more
than two (2) months' rent or twice the damages sustained by them, whichever is
greater, and reasonable attorney's fees.
   F.   One-time Tenant Right to Pay and Stay. At any time prior to the
issuance of any order of possession or eviction order made pursuant to Article
IX ("Eviction") of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/9-101 et seq., the tenant has a one-time right to cure the non-
payment of rent by paying the landlord unpaid rent, duly owed from the date of
non-payment to the date of payment, together with all filing fees and costs
paid by the landlord and all fees and costs expended by the landlord for
service of process, but not including attorney fees. If the tenant so pays,
then the Court shall vacate any order of possession or eviction order and
dismiss the case. If the landlord refuses to provide a total amount due, the
tenant may cure by making a good faith payment of the amount that the tenant
believes to be due. (Ord. 21-60, 7-19-2021)
12-6-6: TENANT REMEDIES:
   A.   Tenant Remedy of Withholding Rent: If the landlord is not in material
compliance with the rental agreement or with section
12-6-5, the tenant may deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the
items of material noncompliance. The tenant may deliver this written notice at
any time of month. The written notice shall indicate that the tenant will
withhold rent on the next rent payment date if the landlord has not remedied
the material noncompliance within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice. The tenant may withhold an amount of rent that reasonably reflects the
reduced value of the premises. The tenant may not withhold for a condition
caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member
of the tenant's family, or other person on the premises with the tenant's
consent.
   B.   Tenant remedy of terminating lease: If the landlord is not in material
compliance with the rental agreement or with section
12-6-5, the tenant may deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the
items of material noncompliance. The tenant may deliver this written notice at
any time of month. The written notice shall indicate that the tenant will
terminate the rental agreement and vacate the property if the landlord has not
remedied the material noncompliance within fourteen (14) days after receipt of
written notice. The tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by the
deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's
family, or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent. If the
tenant does not vacate the property within one (1) month after the expiration
of the fourteen (14)-day period or the end of the next rental period, whichever
is longer, then the tenant's written notice shall be deemed withdrawn and the
rental agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If the rental agreement
is terminated, the landlord shall return the security deposit immediately upon
the tenant tendering possession.
   C.   Tenant remedy of right to file affirmative action: If the landlord is
not in material compliance with the rental agreement or with section
12-6-5 the tenant may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any
material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with
section
12-6-5. The landlord shall have an affirmative defense to this action that the
condition was caused by a deliberate or negligent act or omission of the
tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or other person on the premises with
the tenant's consent.
   D.   Tenant Remedy for Denial of Essential Services:
      1.   If the landlord fails to supply heat, running water, hot water,
electricity, gas, or plumbing that the rental agreement requires the landlord
to provide, or internet access if the rental agreement requires the landlord to
provide, the tenant shall deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying
the service to be restored. If the landlord fails to correct the condition
within twenty-four (24) hours after being notified by the tenant, the tenant
may:
         a.   Withhold from the monthly rent an amount that reasonably reflects
the reduced value of the premises due to the material noncompliance or failure;
or
         b.   Procure reasonable amounts of heat, running water, hot water,
electricity, gas or plumbing service and, upon presentation to the landlord of
paid receipts, deduct the cost from their rent; or
         c.   Recover damages based upon the diminution in the fair rental
value of the dwelling unit and reasonable attorney fees; or
         d.   Procure substitute housing, in which case the tenant is excused
from paying rent for the period of noncompliance. The tenant may recover the
cost of reasonable value of the substitute housing up to an amount equal to the
monthly rent and reasonable fees.
      2.   In addition, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement by
written notice to the landlord if the landlord fails to supply heat, running
water, hot water, electricity, gas, or plumbing that the rental agreement
requires the landlord to provide, or internet access if the rental agreement
requires the landlord to provide, for more than seventy-two (72) hours after
the tenant has notified the landlord. If the rental agreement is terminated,
the landlord shall return all security deposits thereon and the tenant shall
deliver possession of the dwelling unit to the landlord within thirty (30) days
after the expiration of the seventy-two (72) hour time period specified in the
written notice or the end of the next rental period, whichever is longer. The
landlord shall return the security deposit immediately upon the tenant
delivering possession. If the tenant does not vacate the property within thirty
(30) days after the notification of termination or the end of the next rental
period, whichever is longer, then the tenant's written notice shall be deemed
withdrawn and the rental agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
      3.   The tenant may not exercise their rights under section
12-6-6(D) if the condition was caused by the inability of a utility supplier,
or internet provider to provide service, unless the landlord caused the
inability of the utility supplier, or by the deliberate or negligent act or
omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or other person on the
premises with the tenant's consent.
   E.   Tenant Remedies in the Event of Fire or Casualty:
      1.   If the dwelling unit or premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or
casualty to an extent that the dwelling unit is in material noncompliance with
the rental agreement or with section
12-6-5(C), the tenant may immediately vacate the premises and notify the
landlord in writing within fourteen (14) days thereafter of the tenant's
intention to terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement
terminates as of the date of fire or casualty.
      2.   If continued occupancy is lawful, the tenant may vacate any part of
the dwelling unit rendered unusable by the fire or casualty, in which case the
tenant's liability for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the
fair rental value of the dwelling unit.
      3.   If the tenant desires to continue the tenancy and if the landlord
has promised or begun work to repair the damage or destruction but fails to
carry out the work to restore the dwelling unit or common area diligently and
within a reasonable time, the tenant may notify the landlord in writing within
fourteen (14) days after the tenant becomes aware that work is not being
carried out diligently, or within a reasonable time of the tenant's intention
to terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement
terminates as of the date of the fire or casualty.
      4.   If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all
security deposit within forty-eight (48) hours. When the landlord accounts for
rent after the tenant has terminated the rental agreement, the landlord shall
not charge rent to the tenant for any date after the date of the fire or
casualty.
      5.   A tenant may not exercise remedies in this section if the fire or
casualty damage was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of
the tenant, a member of the tenant's family or a person on the premises with
the tenant's consent.
   F.   Tenant Remedy of Withholding Rent to Undertake Minor Repairs:
      1.   If the landlord is not in material compliance with the rental
agreement or with section
12-6-5 and the reasonable cost of compliance does not exceed five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or one-half month's rent, whichever amount is greater, the
tenant may notify the landlord in writing that, if the landlord does not remedy
the condition within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the written notice or as
promptly as conditions require in case of emergency, the tenant will correct
the condition and withhold the cost of the repair from the tenant's next rent
payment. The tenant shall have work done in a worker-like manner. The tenant
shall submit to the landlord a paid bill from an appropriate tradesperson or
supplier at the same time as deducting the amount from their rent. The tenant
may not expend or deduct more than the amount specified in this section.
      2.   A tenant shall not repair at the landlord's expense or deduct rent
if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of
the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or other person on the premises
with the tenant's permission.
      3.   Before correcting a condition affecting facilities shared by more
than one dwelling unit, the tenant shall notify all other affected tenants of
their plans and so arrange the work as to create the least practicable
inconvenience to the other tenants. (Ord. 21-60, 7-19-2021)
12-6-7: TENANT OBLIGATIONS:
The Tenant Shall:
   A.   Comply with all obligations imposed upon tenants by provisions of the
codes applicable to the dwelling unit;
   B.   Keep the part of the premises that they occupy and use as safe as the
condition of the premises permits;
   C.   Dispose from their dwelling unit all ashes, rubbish, garbage and other
waste in a clean and safe manner;
   D.   Keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or used by the tenant
as clean as their condition permits;
   E.   Use, in a reasonable manner, all electrical, plumbing, sanitary,
heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances,
including elevators, in the premises;
   F.   Not deliberately destroy, deface, damage, impair, or remove any part of
the premises or knowingly permit any person to do so;
   G.   Conduct themselves in a manner that will not disturb their neighbors'
peaceful enjoyment of premises; and
   H.   Unless otherwise agreed, only occupy their dwelling unit as a dwelling
unit. (Ord. 21-60, 7-19-2021)
12-6-8: LANDLORD RIGHTS:
   A.   In addition to any rights provided under federal and state law, a
landlord shall have the rights specified in this section under the
circumstances herein set forth.
   B.   Landlord Rights of Entry and Restrictions Thereto:
      1.   A tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to allow the
landlord to enter the dwelling unit to:
         a.   Inspect the premises or conduct inspections authorized or
required by any government agency;
         b.   Make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or
improvements, including where such work elsewhere in the building requires such
access;
         c.   Supply necessary or agreed upon services;
         d.   Exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers,
mortgagees, workmen or contractors;
         e.   Exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective tenants 60 days or less
prior to the expiration of the existing rental agreement; or
         f.   Determine a tenant's compliance with provisions in the rental
agreement.
      2.   The landlord may only enter at reasonable times, except in case of
an emergency. An entry between eight o’clock (8:00) a.m. and eight o’clock (8:
00) p.m. or at any other time expressly requested by the tenant shall be
presumed reasonable.
         a.   A landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the
tenant in case of an emergency.
         b.   The landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to
harass the tenant.
         c.   Except in cases of an emergency, the landlord shall give the
tenant at least two (2) days' written notice of their intent to enter. The
landlord shall provide this written notice directly to each dwelling unit by
mail, telephone, or written notice or by other reasonable means designed in
good faith to provide written notice to the tenant. If access is required
because of repair work for common facilities or multiple apartments, a general
written notice may be given by the landlord to all potentially affected tenants
that entry may be required. In cases where access is authorized due to an
emergency the landlord shall give the tenant written notice of entry within two
(2) days after such entry.
         d.   If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may
obtain injunctive relief to compel access or terminate the rental agreement. In
either case, the landlord may recover damages and reasonable attorney's fees.
         e.   If the landlord makes an unlawful entry, or entry in an
unreasonable manner, or repeated unreasonable demands for entry, which have the
effect of harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to
prevent the recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental agreement. In
each case, the tenant may recover an amount equal to one (1) month's rent or
twice the damages sustained, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney
fees.
   C.   Landlord Right to Adopt Rules and Regulations:
      1.   The landlord may adopt general rules or regulations concerning the
tenant's use and occupancy of the premises. Rules and regulations are
enforceable only if in writing and if they are:
         a.   Made to promote the convenience, safety, and welfare of the
tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord's property from abusive use, or
make a fair distribution of services and facilities among tenants;
         b.   Reasonably related to the purpose for which they are adopted;
         c.   Applied to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;
         d.   Sufficiently clear to inform the tenant of what they must or must
not do to comply;
         e.   Not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord;
and
         f.   Not for the purpose of preventing tenants to assemble or
otherwise communicate amongst each other about the premises.
      2.   A rule or regulation adopted after the tenant enters into the rental
agreement that substantially modifies the rental agreement is not enforceable
unless the tenant consents in writing. (Ord. 21-60, 7-19-2021)
12-6-9: LANDLORD REMEDIES:
   A.   The landlord shall have the following remedies when the tenant fails to
pay rent:
      1.   If the tenant is not in material compliance with the obligation to
pay rent, the landlord may deliver to the tenant a written notice of the
landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement. The landlord shall
serve the written notice in compliance with state law. If the tenant does not
materially comply with the written notice within five (5) days of receipt, the
landlord may file an eviction action to terminate the rental agreement.
      2.   Nothing in this subsection shall affect a landlord's obligation to
provide notice of termination of tenancy in subsidized housing as required
under federal law or regulations.
      3.   A landlord may also maintain an action for rent and/or damages
without terminating the rental agreement.
   B.   The landlord shall have the following remedies when the tenant is not
in material compliance with the rental agreement or the obligations in section
12-6-7.
      1.   If the landlord alleges that the tenant is not in material
compliance with a rental agreement or the obligations in section
12-6-10, the landlord may deliver written notice to the tenant specifying the
acts and omissions constituting the alleged breach. The landlord shall serve
the written notice in compliance with state law. The written notice may provide
that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date no less than 10 days after
the date of the written notice. The tenant shall have the amount of time
specified in the written notice to remedy any alleged breach by the tenant
prior to the date of termination. If the breach is not remedied, the landlord
may file an eviction to terminate the rental agreement, as provided in the
written notice. The landlord may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief
for any material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or the
obligations in section
12-6-10. If the landlord does not file an eviction action within thirty (30)
days after the notification of termination or the end of the next rental
period, whichever is longer, then the landlord's written notice shall be deemed
withdrawn and the rental agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
      2.   The landlord has the right to determine abandonment of the dwelling
unit and dispose of property. The landlord may determine that the tenant has
abandoned the property in the following circumstances:
         a.   The tenant has provided actual written notice to the landlord
indicating the tenant's intention not to return to the dwelling unit.
         b.   All persons entitled under a rental agreement have been absent
from the dwelling unit for a period of thirty-two (32) days, or for one rental
period when the rental agreement is for less than a month, and such persons
have removed their personal property from the premises and rent for that period
is unpaid. However, if any person entitled to occupancy provides the landlord
with written notice indicating that a tenant intends to occupy the dwelling
unit and make full payments of all amounts due to the landlord, then the
landlord may not determine that the tenant has abandoned the property.
         c.   If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make
a good faith effort to rent it at a fair rental value. This shall include the
acceptance of reasonable subleases. If the landlord succeeds in renting the
dwelling unit at a fair rental value, the tenant shall only be liable for the
amount by which the rent due from the date of abandonment to the termination of
the initial rental agreement exceeds the fair rental value subsequently
received by the landlord from the date of abandonment to the termination of the
initial rental agreement. If the landlord makes a good faith effort to rent the
dwelling unit at a fair rental and is unsuccessful, the tenant shall be liable
for the rent due for the period of the rental agreement. The tenant shall also
be liable for reasonable advertising and redecoration costs incurred by the
landlord in re-renting the dwelling unit.
         d.   Unless otherwise agreed, if, upon termination of a tenancy
including, but not limited to, a termination after expiration of a lease or by
surrender or abandonment of the premises, a tenant has left personal property
on the premises, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has
abandoned such personal property, the landlord may dispose of the property
according to the following procedures.
            (1)   If the landlord in good faith reasonably determines that the
tenant has left personal property that is valueless or of such little value
that the cost of storing and conducting a sale would probably exceed the amount
that would be realized from such a sale, the landlord shall retain the property
either in the dwelling unit or remove and store the abandoned property from the
dwelling unit and may dispose of the property after seven (7) days. The
landlord shall not be required to provide written notice to the tenant of its
intent to dispose of property pursuant to this subsection.
            (2)   If the landlord in good faith reasonably determines that the
tenant has left personal property that has value, the landlord shall notify the
tenant in writing of their demand that the tenant remove the property within
dates set forth in the written notice, but no less than seven (7) days after
delivery of the written notice. The landlord may deliver this written notice by
posting it in a prominent location inside the dwelling unit or on the front
door of the dwelling unit or by electronic means if the parties had previously
communicated electronically.
            (3)   If the tenant does not remove the property within the time
specified, the landlord may sell the property at a public sale or at a
commercially reasonable private sale. The landlord may retain the proceeds of
the sale to recover any rent owed by the tenant to the landlord. If the
proceeds, less reasonable costs incurred by such sale or storage, exceed any
rent owed to the landlord, the landlord shall retain the proceeds for one (1)
year. If the tenant does not claim the proceeds within one (1) year, the
proceeds shall be the property of the landlord.
         e.   At any time that the landlord is storing property pursuant to
Sec. 12-6-9, the landlord shall exercise reasonable care of the property, but
shall not be responsible to the tenant for any loss except for damage caused by
the landlord's deliberate or negligent act or omission. The landlord may elect
to store the property in or about the previously vacated premises. The landlord
shall be entitled to the cost of storage for the period of time that the
property has remained in their safekeeping. In such case the storage shall not
exceed commercially reasonable storage rates. If the tenant's property is
removed to a commercial storage company, the storage cost shall include the
actual charge for such storage and removal from the premises to the place of
storage.
         f.   If the tenant timely responds in writing of their intention to
remove the personal property from the premises and does not do so within the
time period in the landlord's written notice or a mutually agreeable date
(whichever is later), it shall be conclusively presumed that they have
abandoned such property.
   C.   The Landlord Right to Rent and Process Renewals of the Tenancy:
      1.   Termination of Tenancy:
         a.   If the landlord accepts rent, including holding payment, knowing
that it alleges a lease violation, including a default in the payment of rent
by the tenant, the landlord waives the right to terminate the rental agreement
for that breach.
         b.   If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord may make a
claim for possession or for rent and a separate claim for damages for breach of
the rental agreement.
      2.   Nonrenewal of Tenancy:
         a.   No tenant shall be required to renew a rental agreement more than
sixty (60) days prior to the termination date of the rental agreement. If the
landlord violates this subsection, the tenant shall recover one (1) month's
rent or actual damages, whichever is greater.
         b.   The landlord shall notify the tenant in writing at least sixty
(60) days prior to the stated termination date of the rental agreement of the
landlord's intent to terminate a month-to-month tenancy or not renew an
existing rental agreement. If the landlord fails to give required written
notice, the tenant may remain in the dwelling unit for up to one hundred and
twenty (120) days after the date on which such required written notice is given
to the tenant, regardless of the date specified in the existing rental
agreement. During such occupancy, the terms and conditions of the tenancy shall
be the same as the terms and conditions during the last month of tenancy. (Ord.
21-60, 7-19-2021)
12-6-10: LANDLORD OBLIGATIONS:
   A.   The landlord shall maintain the premises in compliance with all
applicable provisions of any this Code, including any and all applicable
building codes, and section
12-6-5(C) and shall promptly make any and all repairs to fulfill this
obligation.
   B.   The landlord and tenant of any dwelling unit may agree that the tenant
is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations, or remodeling
only if:
      1.   The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not
for the purpose of evading obligations of the landlord and is set forth in a
separate writing signed by the parties and supported by adequate consideration;
and
      2.   The agreement does not diminish or affect the obligation of the
landlord to other tenants on the premises.
   C.   The Landlord Obligation to Provide a Written Notice Concerning
Habitability:
      1.   Before a tenant initially enters into or renews a rental agreement
for a dwelling unit, the landlord, or any person authorized to enter into a
rental agreement on their behalf, shall disclose to the tenant in writing:
         a.   Any code violations which have been cited by the municipality or
other oversight body during the previous twelve (12) months for the dwelling
unit and common areas and provide written notice of the pendency of any code
enforcement litigation or administrative hearing. The written notice shall
provide the case number of the litigation and/or the identification number of
the administrative hearing proceeding and a listing of any code violations
cited;
         b.   Any notice of intent by the municipality or any utility provider
to terminate water, gas, electrical, or other utility service to the dwelling
unit or common areas. The disclosure shall state the type of service being
terminated, the intended date of termination, and whether the termination will
affect the dwelling unit, common areas or both.
      2.   If the landlord fails to comply with section
12-6-10(C), the tenant may terminate the rental agreement by written notice.
The written notice shall specify the date of termination no later than thirty
(30) days from the date of written notice. In addition, if a tenant, in a civil
legal proceeding against an owner or landlord, establishes that the landlord
has violated this section, the tenant shall be entitled to recover one (1)
month's rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney's
fees.
   D.   The landlord has an obligation to maintain the premises free from bed
bugs.
      1.   Landlords subject to this section must provide to all prospective
and current lessees with a copy of the current, approved U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency federal pamphlet on bed bug prevention, detection and
control.
      2.   In any rental dwelling unit in which an infestation of bed bugs is
found or reasonably suspected, it is the responsibility of the landlord to:
         a.   Provide pest control services by a pest management professional
until such time that no evidence of bed bugs can be found and verified;
         b.   Maintain a written record of the pest control measures performed
by the pest management professional on the rental dwelling unit. The record
shall include reports and receipts prepared by the pest management
professional. The record shall be maintained for three (3) years and shall be
open to inspection by authorized city personnel, including but not limited to
employees of the departments of health and buildings.
      3.   In any multiple rental dwelling unit building in which an
infestation of bed bugs is found or reasonably suspected, it is the
responsibility of the landlord to:
         a.   Provide pest control services by a pest management professional
until such time that no evidence of bed bugs can be found and verified within
the building or portion thereof, including the individual rental dwelling

         b.   Maintain a written record of the pest control measures performed
by pest management professional on the building. The record shall include
reports and receipts prepared by the pest management professional. The record
shall be maintained for three (3) years and shall be open to inspection by
authorized city personnel, including, but not limited to, employees of the
departments of health and buildings.
      4.   A landlord shall provide the pest control services within ten (10)

premises;
         b.   Being notified in writing by a tenant of a known or reasonably
suspected bed bug infestation on the premises or in the tenant's rental
dwelling unit.
      5.   The extermination of bed bugs shall be by inspection, and if
necessary, the treatment of the dwelling unit on either side of the affected
dwelling unit and the dwelling unit directly above and below the affected
dwelling unit. This pattern of inspection and treatment shall be continued
until no further infestation is detected.
      6.   The tenant shall notify the landlord in writing of any bed bug
detection within forty-eight (48) hours of noticing the presence of any bed
bugs.
      7.   If the landlord fails to notify the tenant of the intention to
comply with section
12-6-10(D) after receipt of written notice, the tenant may terminate the rental
agreement by written notice. However, the tenant may exercise the right to
terminate the rental agreement only if the tenant first gives the landlord
written notice of the landlord's breach of this section and the landlord does
not remedy the breach within two (2) business days after the tenant delivered
the written notice of breach. The written notice that the tenant intends to
terminate the rental agreement shall specify the date of termination no later
than thirty (30) days from the date of written notice. The written notices
required by this section may be delivered electronically if the parties have
previously communicated electronically. In addition, if a tenant in a civil
legal proceeding against an owner or landlord establishes that a violation of
this section has occurred, they shall be entitled to recover one (1) month's
rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney's fees.
The tenant shall not have this remedy if the tenant unreasonably refused to
cooperate with or unreasonably delayed the extermination process.

      1.   The landlord must follow all applicable municipal, state and federal
regulations regarding lead poisoning and must specifically:

current, approved U.S. Environmental Protection Agency federal pamphlet on
lead-based paint disclosure; and

receiving it, and, in the case of the agent, the name of the landlord for whom
such a security deposit is received, the date on which it is received, and a

property shall be liable to that tenant for any security deposit which has been
paid to the transferor.
   K.   The transferor shall remain jointly and severally liable with the
successor landlord to the tenant for such security deposit unless and until

their agent within ten (10) days of the transfer.
   L.   Within fourteen (14) days from the date of the transfer, the successor

holding the security deposit. This written notice shall also contain the name,
business address and business telephone number of the successor landlord or
their agent.

requirements as set forth in sections
12-6-11(D) through

   A.   Except as provided for in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by
increasing rent or decreasing services, or by bringing or threatening to bring
action for possession, or by refusing to renew a rental agreement because the
tenant has in good faith:
      1.   Complained of code violations to a governmental agency, including
the Village, elected representative, or public official charged with
responsibility for enforcement of a building, housing, health, or similar code;
      2.   Complained of a building, housing, health, or similar code violation
or an illegal landlord practice to a community organization or the news media;
      3.   Sought the assistance of a community organization, including a legal
aid organization, or the news media to remedy a code violation or illegal
landlord practice;

agreement;
      5.   Organized or becomes a member of a tenant union or similar
organization;
      6.   Testified in any court or administrative proceeding concerning the
condition of the premises; or
      7.   Exercised any right or remedy provided by law.
   B.   If the landlord violates section
12-6-12, the tenant has a cause of action against the landlord or a defense in
any retaliatory action against them and is entitled to the following remedies:
      1.   If the landlord attempts to terminate the rental agreement, the
tenant may retain possession by raising this section as a defense. If the
tenant prevails on this defense, the tenant shall recover an amount equal to
not more than two (2) months' rent or twice the damages sustained by the
tenant, whichever shall be greater, and reasonable attorney's fees.
      2.   The tenant may terminate the rental agreement and vacate the
property by giving the landlord written notice of the tenant's intent to
terminate the rental agreement. If the tenant does not vacate the property
within one (1) month after giving written notice, or the end of the next rental
period, whichever is longer, then the tenant's written notice shall be deemed
withdrawn and the rental agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If
the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return the security
deposit within three (3) days after the tenant tenders possession.
      3.   If the tenant files a cause of action against the landlord, the
tenant shall recover an amount equal to not more than two (2) months' rent or
twice the damages sustained by the tenant, whichever is greater, and reasonable
attorney's fees.
   C.   In an action by or against the tenant, if the tenant presents evidence
of a complaint within one (1) year prior to the alleged act of retaliation, the
court shall presume that the landlord's conduct is retaliatory. The landlord
may rebut the presumption of retaliation by proving a legitimate, non-
retaliatory basis for the conduct.
   D.   The presumption shall not arise if the tenant made the complaint after
written notice of a proposed rent increase.
   E.   A landlord's behavior shall not be considered retaliatory if any code
violation was caused primarily by the lack of care of the tenant, a member of
the tenant's family or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent.
(Ord. 21-60, 7-19-2021)
12-6-13: PROHIBITION AGAINST LOCKOUTS:

12-6-9(B)(2).

unit and personal property. In addition, the tenant shall recover an amount
equal to not more than two (2) months' rent or twice the actual damages

13-2-2: LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS:
   A.   This chapter shall not apply to the rental of any room or units in

   G.   The provisions of this chapter are limited to real estate transactions
solely in connection with property located in the Village. (Ord. 16-033, 3-21-
2016)
13-2-3: REAL ESTATE FOR RENT AND FOR SALE SIGNS PROHIBITED:
The President and Board of Trustees find as follows:
   A.   That a prohibition of "For Sale" and "Sold" signs has been recommended
by the Commission on Community Relations on the basis that said signs tend to
encourage unfair housing practices and tend to defeat the purposes of the
Village's human rights program.
   B.   That a prohibition of "For Rent" signs has been recommended by the
Commission on Community Relations for the following reasons:
      1.   "For Rent" signs presently are used more frequently in areas that
have a greater percentage of occupancy of minority residents. "For Rent" signs
are seldom used in connection with buildings that have no minority occupants.
The use of these signs therefore tends to "signal" that minorities may be more
welcome in some areas of the Village than others and this tends to segregate
areas contrary to the policy of the Village to maintain an integrated
community.
      2.   A proliferation of "For Rent" signs encourages panic peddling and
block busting.
      3.   "For Rent" signs may give an appearance of community instability
when concentrated in a limited geographic area.
      4.   A proliferation of "For Rent" signs may infer that an area is less
desirable than other areas.
      5.   A system of apartment management that refers tenants to the source
of rentals will encourage greater professionalism in apartment management.
It shall, therefore, be unlawful for any person to construct, place, maintain
or install a "For Sale", "Sold" or "For Rent" sign on any property developed
for residential use in the Village. The term "For Sale" sign shall include
signs carrying the following or similar words: "Open House" or "Open For
Inspection" and shall include any other devices placed on the property to
indicate that the property is for sale.
In the case of new construction of residential property or conversion of an
existing structure to condominium use where a condominium declaration is
recorded, a "For Sale" sign shall be permitted on the property until the
property or condominium units are sold, but not to exceed one and one-half (11/
2) years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a new building or
from the date the "For Sale" sign is posted in the case of a conversion. (Ord.
16-033, 3-21-2016)
13-2-3.1: OPEN HOUSE SIGNS PERMITTED ON SUNDAYS:
Notwithstanding section
13-1-2 of this article, "Open House" signs will be permitted on Sunday, subject
to the following conditions:
   A.   The wording on the sign is limited to "Open For Inspection" or "Open
House".
   B.   The display of signs is limited to the hours of the "Open House" and in
no event shall be displayed in excess of four (4) hours.
   C.   The size of the sign is limited to twenty four inches by thirty six
inches (24" x 36").
   D.   The signs are not to be posted on public land.
   E.   The Director of the Community Relations Department will report to the
Board of Trustees on or about February 1 of each year as to the effect "Open
House" signs have on the general purposes of this section. (Ord. 16-033, 3-21-
2016)

vehicle in any public parking area posted Reserved Parking and bearing the

For the purposes of this section, "a person with a disability" shall mean a
person with registration plates or a decal or device designated for a person
with a disability pursuant to 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-616, 5/11-
1301.1, 5/11-1301.2, or to veterans with disabilities as provided in 625

persons with disabilities only long enough to drop off or pick up such person
or persons from a designated place. The regular use of special motor vehicles
or buses for the transport of persons with disabilities to and from a
designated place shall be considered as evidence indicating the need for a drop

must establish to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works or the
Director's designee that the issuance of the disabled parking permit will
alleviate some demonstrable hardship presently borne by the applicant.
Applicants who possess off street parking which is easily accessible from the
applicant's dwelling will be presumed not to have a hardship which will be
relieved by the issuance of a disabled parking permit. There shall also be a
presumption that applicants who reside in single- family dwellings with side
drives which are accessible from the street are not subject to a hardship which
will be relieved by the issuance of a disabled parking permit.
      3.   Permits Approved By The Director Of Public Works And Issued By The
Parking Permit Office: The Director of Public Works or the Director's designee

citations attributable to the applicant or applicant's vehicle prior to
issuance.
      4.   Disabled Parking Permits; Parking Regulations; Overnight Parking
Ban: The disabled parking permit shall be affixed to the lower right hand
corner of the rear windshield of the applicant's vehicle. The appropriately
affixed disabled parking permit will entitle the applicant, when driving such

is allocated. Such vehicle, while parked in the designated permit parking
space, will not be subject to parking regulations related to time, such as No
Parking 8–10 A.M. or 2 Hour Parking.
The disabled parking permit shall not, however, override the overnight parking
ban in effect throughout the Village. (Ord. 1995-0-37, 6-5-1995)

   A.   The hearing officer shall conduct posttow hearings.
   B.   The hearing officer, upon receipt of a completed request for hearing,
shall cause such hearing to be placed on a calendar for hearings within the
time frame established herein. The hearing officer shall review all evidence
presented by the vehicle owner and by the Village of Oak Park, and make a
finding based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented as to the lawful
authority for the towing and storage of the vehicle. The decision shall be in
favor of the owner if the preponderance of the evidence does not show such tow
to be lawful. For each request for hearing, the hearing officer shall complete
a report of the hearing and attach such report to the requested package.
   C.   After receiving all relevant evidence, the hearing officer shall make
one or more of the following findings:
      1.   That the towing and storage of the vehicle was authorized by the
laws of the State of Illinois or of the ordinances of the Village of Oak Park
and, in the case of a vehicle for which the outstanding charges remain
unsatisfied, the hearing officer may further authorize the towing and storage
of the vehicle;
      2.   That there was no authorization under Illinois law or the ordinances
of the Village of Oak Park for the towing and storage of the vehicle or that
the member causing the vehicle to be towed did not comply with the requirements
of the statute or ordinance authorizing the tow;
      3.   That the towing of the vehicle was authorized by law but the owner
was caused to incur additional storage charges because of late notification of
towing or failure to promptly release a vehicle upon which a hold had been
placed;
      4.   That the request for hearing was not made within the specified
number of days following receipt of a notice of the tow or of the date that the
vehicle was released, whichever date is earlier in time;
      5.   That the owner failed to appear, despite requesting a hearing, and
no continuance was requested; or
      6.   That a continuance was requested by the owner requesting the
hearing, in which event the hearing officer may cause a date to be selected to
reflect the continuance date requested, if the request is granted.
   D.   The hearing officer shall advise the vehicle owner of his findings at
the conclusion of the hearing. If the towing and storage was authorized by law
and is not otherwise reimbursable, the vehicle owner shall be so informed and
further advised as to the amount due. Should the towing or storage be found to
be unauthorized or reimbursable, in whole or in part, the hearing officer
shall: 1) if the vehicle has been released to the owner prior to the hearing,
determine the amount of the deposit paid and direct that a refund in an
appropriate amount shall be transmitted by the Village of Oak Park to the owner
within seven (7) days; 2) if the vehicle is still in the pound at the time of
the hearing or in a relocated garage, the hearing officer shall complete an
order for release of the vehicle and provide the vehicle owner with an original
and copy of same. Upon receipt of a copy of said release form from the owner,

that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien on the property that was the
subject of the eradication effort. The Director of Public Works shall present a
resolution of lien to the Village Board and upon passage and adoption thereof,

any private property; (2) deny a common law right to any person or entity to
abate a nuisance; (3) affect the status of ongoing Village prosecution or other
action; (4) prevent the issuance of a citation to any person or prosecution of

forth in section
16-3-8 of this article, the Village may commence an action in the circuit court
of Cook County fourth municipal district or chancery division of the circuit
court of Cook County for a determination that the property is a criminal
nuisance property and/or to abate the criminal nuisance.
   B.   Injunction: Upon being satisfied by affidavits or other sworn evidence
that an alleged criminal nuisance property exists, the court may, without
notice or bond, enter a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
or permanent injunction to enjoin any defendant from maintaining such criminal
nuisance property and may enter an order restraining any defendant named from
occupying, using or interfering with all property used in connection with the
criminal nuisance property.
   C.   Commencement Of Action, Burden Of Proof:
      1.   In an action seeking a determination that a property is a criminal
nuisance property, the Village shall have the initial burden of showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that the property is a criminal nuisance
property. The owner or person shall be permitted to rebut such evidence and
present any other evidence that is, in the discretion of the court, relevant
and reliable.
      2.   It shall be an affirmative defense by the person in charge or the
owner to an action seeking a determination that a property is a criminal
nuisance property that the owner or person in charge at the time in question
could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the
property had become a criminal nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the
exercise of reasonable care or diligence, control the conduct of tenants or
others in possession leading to the finding that the property is a criminal
nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care
and diligence, obtain an order for possession of the property, pursuant to the
provisions of the forcible entry and detainer act, 735 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/9-101 et seq., or that the owner or person in charge was the victim
of the crime, including, but not limited to, an act of domestic or sexual
violence as those terms are defined in section 10 of the safe homes act, 765
Illinois Compiled Statutes 750/10, or stalking as that term is defined in the
criminal code of 2012, 720 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/12-7.3.
      3.   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty or other relief
requested, the court may consider any of the following factors, if they are
found appropriate, and shall cite those found applicable:
         a.   The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge or
the owner to mitigate or correct the criminal nuisance activities at the
property;
         b.   Whether the criminal activities at the property were repeated or
continuous;
         c.   The magnitude or gravity of the criminal nuisance activities at
the property;
         d.   The cooperation of the person in charge or the owner of the
property with the Village to correct the offending condition or abate the
nuisance;
         e.   Whether the owner or property manager, in the event of rental or
leased property, has required the tenant(s) to sign a "crime free lease
addendum";
         f.   Whether the person in charge or the owner has attended the
Village's crime free housing seminar; and
         g.   The cost to the Village of investigating and correcting or
attempting to correct the condition.
   D.   Remedy:
      1.   In the event a court determines a property to be a criminal nuisance
property, the court may order that the property be closed and secured against
all use and occupancy for a period of not less than thirty (30) days, but not
more than one hundred eighty (180) days or until the criminal nuisance activity
or violation is abated. In addition, the court may employ any other remedy
deemed by it appropriate to permanently abate the nuisance, including the entry
of a permanent injunction enjoining any tenants, co-tenants, and/or occupants
responsible or partially responsible for the property becoming a criminal
nuisance property from future use, occupancy of or presence at or upon the
property.
      2.   In addition to the remedy provided in subsection
16-3-9D1 of this section, the court may impose upon the person in charge or the
owner of the property in question a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed
the sum of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per day, payable to the
Village of Oak Park, for each day the person in charge or the owner had actual
knowledge that the property was a criminal nuisance property and permitted the
property to remain a criminal nuisance property.
      3.   In determining what remedy or remedies to employ, the court may
consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the property,
including, but not limited to:
         a.   The disturbance of neighbors;
         b.   The occurrence of other criminal nuisance activities at, on or
from the property;
         c.   The property's general reputation for criminal nuisance activity;
         d.   Physical damage to the property in question or surrounding
properties; and
         e.   Any hazard posed to any occupant of the property or adjoining
property occupant or owner resulting from the physical condition of the
property in question or its structures.
   E.   Secure Property: The court may authorize the Village to physically
secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the person in charge
or the owner of the property fails to do so within the time specified by the
court. In the event that the Village is authorized to secure the property, all
costs reasonably incurred by the Village to effectuate the closure shall be
made and assessed as a judgment against the owner and shall be a debt due and
owing the Village. As used herein, "costs" mean those costs actually incurred
by the Village for the physical securing of the property.
   F.   Costs To Secure Property: The Village shall prepare a statement of
costs incurred to physically secure the property and any other applicable costs
as provided by law, and the Village shall thereafter submit said statement to
the court for its review and approval.
   G.   Payment: Any person who is assessed the cost to physically secure a
property and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the
payment thereof to the Village.
   H.   Obligation To Pay Rent: The entry of an order or injunction by the
court against a tenant pursuant to this section shall not constitute a defense
of the obligation to pay rent by such tenant during any applicable effective
period of such order or injunction. (Ord. 2013-0-75, 12-9-2013; amd. Ord. 22-
45, 6-6-2022; Ord. 22-63, 9-6-2022)
16-3-10: CRIMINAL NUISANCE PROPERTY LOCATED AT MULTI-UNIT RENTAL RESIDENTIAL
PROPERTY:
In the event any criminal nuisance property is a multi-unit rental residential
property, any order entered by the court to abate the nuisance or otherwise
vacate the property shall, in the discretion of the court, be limited in scope
as to apply only to the individual rental unit or person(s) in charge or tenant
(s) or occupants of that unit forming the basis for a finding that the property
is a criminal nuisance property. (Ord. 2013-0-75, 12-9-2013; amd. Ord. 22-63,
9-6-2022)
16-3-11: RETALIATION PROHIBITED:
It shall be unlawful for a person in charge or owner to terminate the lease
agreement of a tenant or otherwise retaliate against any tenant because that
tenant complained or otherwise notified the Village concerning criminal
nuisance activity at a property. Such termination or retaliation shall be
enforceable as a violation of this article. (Ord. 2013-0-75, 12-9-2013; amd.

17-1-13: OBSCENITY:
   A.   Elements Of The Offense: A person commits the offense of obscenity
when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to
exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content
thereof, he:
      1.   Sells, delivers or provides or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or
provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or

regulations of the State of Illinois; or
      6.   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or
held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   B.   Obscene Defined: A thing is "obscene" if, considered as a whole, its
predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid
interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond
customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. A
thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of
undeveloped photographs.
A thing is obscene if it contains potentially offensive representations or
descriptions of nude persons, ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted sexual
conduct (whether actual or simulated), or potentially offensive representations
or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the
genitals.
   C.   Interpretation Of Evidence: Obscenity shall be judged with reference to
ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or
other specifically susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of
the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed
for or directed to such an audience.
Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination,
distribution or publicity indicate that material is being commercially
exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with
respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the
matter is utterly without redeeming social importance.
In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be
admissible to show:
      1.   The character of the audience for which the material was designed or
to which it was directed;
      2.   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary
adults or a special audience, and what effect if any, it would probably have on
the behavior of such people;
      3.   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of
the material, or absence thereof;
      4.   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
Village;
      5.   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or
other promotion of the material; or
      6.   The purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator. (1981
Code)
17-1-14: PUBLIC INDECENCY:

   C.   A lewd exposure of the body done with intent to arouse or to satisfy
the sexual desire of the person; or
   D.   A lewd fondling or caress of the body of another person of either sex.
"Public place" for purposes of this section means any place where the conduct
may reasonably be expected to be viewed by others. (1981 Code)

dwelling units to store all garbage, except compostable kitchen waste placed in
a compost pile, and refuse in a "mobile cart" as defined in section
20-7-1  of this article, except for permissible shared mobile carts under this
article. Mobile carts which weigh in excess of fifty (50) pounds when filled
will not be collected by the Village. Garbage and refuse in any other type of
container will not be collected by the Village. It shall be the duty of every

or less dwelling units to store all garbage and refuse in a mobile cart and/or
in garbage and refuse containers of standard, waterproof metal or plastic
construction with handles and a tightfitting cover, which containers shall be
no larger than forty (40) gallons in capacity and sufficient in size and number
to hold one week's accumulation. Leaking or otherwise defective garbage and

   It shall be the duty of every owner, operator, occupant or responsible party
of every building within the Village presenting yard waste for collection by
the Village to separately dispose of yard waste in the form of grass clippings
and small yard material and brush only in "yard waste bags" as defined in
section
20-7-1  of this article, or in a rigid container of up to thirty (30) gallons,
which container is clearly labeled "Yard Waste Only". Limbs of less than three
inches (3") in diameter and two feet (2') or less in length may also be
disposed of in yard waste bags. Bundles of brush, securely tied and not
exceeding four feet (4') in length may be neatly stacked next to the yard waste
bags for the separately scheduled regular yard waste collection. The Village
will not collect bundles of brush tied with either wire or plastic cord. Yard
waste will only be collected if it is disposed of in yard waste bags or
containers to which is affixed a Village yard waste sticker. Yard waste
stickers may be purchased at Village Hall and through local vendors.
Information as to the location of vendors shall be available through the
Village's Director of Public Works or his designee.
   Recyclable material may only be donated to the Village for recycling by
placement of specified materials in official Village boxes or at designated
Village of Oak Park recycling stations located throughout the Village or by
placement in the official Village recycling container owned by the Village but
made available to individual residents exclusively for the collection of
recyclable materials; except that when the amount of recyclable material
exceeds the space available in the recycling container, recyclable materials
may be placed in Kraft paper bags, or in the case of newspaper, either placed
in Kraft paper bags or bundled and tied only with string, and then placed on
top of or next to the recycling container for collection. Mixed paper may also
be placed inside of, on top of or next to the recycling container for
collection. Regardless of placement, however, mixed paper must always be
separated from newspaper, flattened out and bundled with twine in two (2)
directions. Mixed paper may be placed in Kraft bags, but such bags must also be

placed in Kraft paper bags and then placed in the recycling container.
   Yard and compostable kitchen waste may also be used in a compost pile.
Garbage (excluding compostable kitchen waste) and untreated animal excrement
are prohibited as compost ingredients. All compost piles shall be aerated on a
regular basis to avoid anaerobic conditions which are conducive to rodent and
insect infestation and the creation of noxious and offensive odors. Any compost
pile which is not created or tended in a manner consistent with these
provisions may be declared to be a public nuisance under the nuisance
provisions of this code for purposes of abatement and prosecution.
   Garbage shall be drained of moisture and wrapped in paper or plastic before
it is deposited in the container. Containers to which garbage is frozen for
failure to observe the above regulation, and garbage contained in receptacles
which also contain yard waste, or dog defecation or similar offensive matter,
will not be collected by the Village.
   Items such as toys, securely tied bundles of papers, crates, empty cartons,
and small items suitable for collection by packer type equipment shall be
neatly stacked next to approved containers for collection.
   No containers are necessary for items such as large and bulky appliances
(refrigerators, washing machines, stoves, dryers, etc.), large toys, furniture,
empty cartons, empty crates, newspapers and magazines when securely tied in
bundles convenient to handle, brush and branches, Christmas trees and other
large discarded household objects. Refrigerators and similar equipment not in

placed for collection close to, but not encroaching upon, the public alley
abutting the property for which they are provided, and shall be no more than
three feet (3') from the alley and easily accessible to the collector or on the
alley of any rear yard fence or enclosure. The Director of Public Works may
approve the placing of containers in an alley in the least obtrusive manner
possible where the location of adjoining structures makes it impossible to
locate the containers on private property. This approval is limited to
specified containers in specified locations and may be withdrawn at any time
when, at the discretion of the Public Works Director, the container or
containers create an unreasonable obstruction of the public way. In areas where
there are no alleys, residents in such areas shall place garbage, refuse, yard
waste, recyclable materials and materials for collection close to, but not
encroaching upon, the street in the area between the street curbing and the
sidewalk. All garbage and refuse storage areas shall be maintained by owners,
occupants or responsible parties in a clean condition. All containers and
materials for collection shall be placed out prior to seven o'clock (7:00) A.M.
on the designated collection day. The regular collection day for garbage and
refuse, yard waste and recyclable material may be different. Where the
collection days coincide, however, recycling containers and materials and yard
waste bags and recyclable materials shall be placed next to garbage and refuse
containers for collection. Containers shall be retrieved by ten o'clock (10:00)
P.M. after they have been emptied by the collector.
   During the annual fall leaf collection period, leaves shall be placed for
collection in yard waste bags with a weight less than fifty (50) pounds when
filled with leaves to be placed in the parkway as close to the curb as
possible. The Village shall give notice to the public of the beginning and the
length of the collection period by publication in a local newspaper, not less
than one week prior to the beginning of the period.
   C.   Bulk Material And Extra Trash Pickups: Occasional extra trash may be
disposed of in containers of not more than thirty two (32) gallon capacity.
Extra trash so disposed of will only be collected if there is affixed to the

(During continual operation, smoke of densities 2 or 1 as read on the
Ringelmann scale is permitted. However, number 2 smoke is permitted only for 8
minutes per hour.
For the purpose of cleaning and banking fires, soot blowing or process purging,
number 3 smoke as read on the Ringelmann scale is allowed for 6 minutes, and
number 2 smoke for 12 minutes every 6 hours.
For the purpose of building new fires, number 3 smoke is permitted for 6
minutes and number 2 smoke for 12 minutes every 24 hours.
Smoke of number 4 or 5 density is never permitted. Smoke of number 1 density is
permitted at all times.)
      1.   The Ringelmann chart shall be the standard for determining the
appearance, density or shade of smoke. The scale should be held at arm's length
at which distance the dots in the scale will blend into uniform shades.
Observer's line of observation should be at right angles to the direction of
smoke travel. Observer should not be less than one hundred feet (100') nor more
than one-fourth (1/4) mile from the stack. Observer should avoid looking toward
bright sunlight. The background immediately beyond the top of the stack should
be free of buildings or other dark objects. Where the density of the smoke as
observed falls between two (2) consecutive Ringelmann numbers, the lower
Ringelmann number shall be considered the density of smoke observed. For the
purpose of calculating smoke units, a Ringelmann density reading shall be made
at least once every minute during the period of observation; and each reading
shall be multiplied by the time in minutes during which it is observed. The
various products thus obtained shall be added together to give the total number
of "smoke units" observed during the total period under observation.
The Ringelmann chart as published by the United States bureau of mines is
adopted by reference and three (3) copies of said chart are on file in the
office of the Village Clerk and available for public use, inspection and
examination.
      2.   Air contaminants exceeding the limits set forth in the preceding
table may be summarily abated by the Director of Community Development. Such
abatement may be in addition to the fine hereinafter provided.
   B.   It shall also be unlawful for any person owning or operating, whether
as principal, agent or employee, any fuel burning, combustion, or process
equipment or device or portable boiler or open fire to cause, suffer or allow
the operation thereof, with any solid fuel, other than low volatile solid fuel.
The Director shall maintain and upon request furnish a list of brands or trade
names of fuels which have been tested for conformity with the provisions of
this chapter and which, as a result of such tests, have been approved. Adequate
supplies of such fuel shall be made available to the Director to conduct such
reasonable tests as he shall deem necessary to determine that such fuel meets
the standards hereinbefore established. The reasonable expense of any such
tests shall be borne by the person seeking the approval of such fuel.
   C.   It shall also be unlawful for any person owning or operating, whether
as principal, agent or employee any fuel burning, combustion, process equipment
or device or portable boiler to cause, suffer or allow the burning of any
combustible refuse except in a multiple chamber incinerator equipped with
auxiliary automatic gas firing equipment with adjustable operation cycle timers
and pilot and flame failure protective devices. Such multiple chamber
incinerators shall not be of the flue fed type. This provision shall not apply
to domestic refuse burning equipment.
Incinerators shall be constructed in accordance with the applicable standards
as set forth in the publication "Incinerator Standards", published from time to
time by the Incinerator Institute Of America, and they shall be of the
requisite capacity as shown in the incinerator capacity chart therein.
"Incinerator Standards" published by Incinerator Institute Of America is
adopted by reference and three (3) copies of said publication are on file in
the office of the Village Clerk and available for public use, inspection and
examination.
Where only the combustion of type I waste, as defined in the publication
"Incinerator Standards" published from time to time by the Incinerator
Institute Of America, is to take place in a multiple chamber incinerator, the
Director may, at his discretion, waive the requirement for auxiliary automatic
gas firing equipment with adjustable operation cycle timers. This waiver may be
rescinded upon a finding by the Director that the actual use of the incinerator
is in violation of the requirements of this section.
Existing flue fed class II incinerators as defined in the publication
"Incinerator Standards" published from time to time by the Incinerator
Institute Of America, may continue to be used provided that they meet or are
modified to meet the following requirements:
      1.   These incinerators shall be served by a separate flue to which only
the incinerator will be connected.
      2.   Flue door openings shall be designed so that the clear opening of
the door shall not exceed one-third (1/3) of the cross sectional area of the
flue.
      3.   Flue doors and frames shall be approved and labeled by the
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.
      4.   Flue doors shall be self-closing.
      5.   These incinerators shall be equipped with auxiliary automatic gas
firing equipment with adjustable operation cycle timers.
      6.   The auxiliary gas firing equipment shall be equipped with pilot and
flame failure protective devices.
      7.   These incinerators shall have a roof mounted settling chamber
proportioned to reduce gas velocity to one-fourth (1/4) of the velocity in the
flue.
      8.   These incinerators shall have a chimney height of five feet (5')
above the highest point of the building or above any obstruction within fifty
feet (50') of the chimney.
      9.   These incinerators shall have a minimum grate area of fifteen-
hundredths (0.15) square feet per sleeping room or efficiency unit.
      10.   These incinerators shall have a minimum volume of three (3) cubic
feet for each square foot of grate area.
      11.   These incinerators shall have secondary or overfire air provided
through adjustable openings equivalent in area to two (2) square inches per
square foot of grate area. (1981 Code)
   D.   No open fires are allowed. No person shall burn leaves or other refuse
in an open fire.
Exceptions:
      1.   Open fires which are used for cooking food at public and private
gatherings are permitted. However, they shall meet the smoke requirements of
this chapter and applicable nuisance provisions of this code.
      2.   Open fires used for the management of native landscaping provided
the property owner first obtains a permit from the Oak Park Fire Department
prior to the open fire. Such permit shall be issued without charge. If the fire
is to occur on public property such as the parkway, the property owner must
apply at least ten (10) days prior to the fire. The permit shall be conditioned
on the property owner complying with the following restrictions:
         a.   The property owner shall provide proof of required permits from
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control to the Fire Department and the Public Works Department.
         b.   If the burn is to occur on Village property or on the public
right of way, the property owner must protect Village property such as trees,
utility poles and other Village property in the public right of way from damage
in accordance with the direction of the Public Works Department and the Fire

public ground that may heretofore have been or may hereafter be used and to any
structures that have heretofore been or may hereafter be constructed.
22-6-2: PERMIT - APPLICATION:
Any person desiring to procure a permit for the use of any space underneath the

the Director of Public Works, all liability under the bond theretofore given by
such owner shall cease and determine, except as to the acts happening or causes
of action accruing prior to the completion of the work of closing such space to
the satisfaction of such Director. If, however, such purchaser shall pay a
transfer fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) and shall execute a new bond

permit shall be issued to such purchaser covering and applying to the same
vault or space specified in the original permit and it shall not be necessary

purchaser shall act as a release of liability under the bond originally given,
except as to causes of action accruing prior to the filing of such new bond.
The bond required in this Section shall be renewed and maintained, until such
time as the use of the space beneath the streets has terminated and the area is
restored to its original condition.
The permittee in lieu of the bond aforesaid, may furnish the Village a
certificate of insurance showing the Village included as a party insured in an
amount of not less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), insuring
the Village from all losses, damages or claims arising out of the use of the

22-6-2 of this Code shall be accompanied by a written agreement upon a blank
form provided by the Village and signed by the owner of the abutting property,

underneath the surface of the street or other public ground as set forth in
this Article, hold the Village harmless from any claims for damages to himself
or the occupants of such estate resulting from gas, sewage or water leaking
into such excavation, release, relinquish, vacate and remove without cost to

rent or fee, that in case of failure to comply with the written order of the
Director of Public Works within the time specified the Director of Public Works
may cause the same to be done and all expenses incurred or damages paid by the
Village on account thereof shall be paid by the person to whom the permit is
granted to the Village upon demand, that the Village may at any time enter upon
the premises for inspection and proper maintenance of anything therein, and
that the permit is granted with the understanding that the occupancy and use of
such space underneath the sidewalk by the applicant, his heirs, successors and
assigns is merely an accommodation and no right, title or interest of the
public is in any way waived or abridged thereby.
22-6-6: PERMIT - ISSUANCE; REFUSAL:
Upon the filing of the application, bond and agreement as required in this
Article, and upon the review of the application and plans by the Building and

the permit, the fee paid and the name and address of the person to whom the
permit is issued. Permits shall be consecutively numbered, nontransferable and
nonassignable and revocable by the Director of Public Works upon thirty (30)

feet (25') of frontage shall be given a separate number and numbered
consecutively from the eastern limits of the Village west to the western limits
of the Village. The odd numbers shall be on the south and the even numbers on
the north sides. The first numbers beginning at Austin Boulevard, except on
Roosevelt Road and on North Avenue, shall be 1 and 2 respectively. The first
number on Roosevelt Road shall be 6000 and the first number on North Avenue
shall be 6001, thence westerly to Harlem Avenue. The numbers shall be graduated
upon the basis of eight (8) blocks in each mile (i.e., there shall be assigned
to each mile eight hundred (800) numbers, or one hundred (100) numbers to each
1/8 of a mile; such numbers shall change from 100 to the succeeding hundred at
the intersecting street nearest to such 1/8 mile line).
   B.   On all of the north and south streets of the Village, except on Austin
Boulevard and Harlem Avenue, as hereinafter specified, the right of way of the
Galena division of the Chicago And Northwestern Railway Company shall be taken
as the dividing line and each twenty five feet (25') of frontage shall be given
a separate number, extending north to the northern limits and south to the
southern limits of the Village, the first numbers north or south of such
baseline being numbered 100 and 101, respectively. The odd numbers shall be on
the west side of such streets and the even numbers on the east side of such
streets. There shall be assigned to each mile eight hundred (800) numbers, or
one hundred (100) numbers to each one-eighth (1/8) of a mile, with the
following exceptions:
      1.   In the territory north of such baseline and west of and including
both sides of Oak Park Avenue: All numbers south of Ontario Street shall be
from 100 to 200; between Ontario Street and Erie Street, from 200 to 300;
between Erie Street and Superior Street (and Superior Street extended from Oak
Park Avenue to Forest Avenue) from 300 to 400; and between Superior Street and

Harrison Street, Grove Avenue and Harlem Avenue, the numbers between Madison
Street and Monroe Street shall be from 500 to 600; between Monroe Street and
Adams Street, from 600 to 700; between Adams Street and Jackson Boulevard, from

shall be from 1100 to 1200.
      4.   The method of numbering the houses and lots fronting on Austin
Boulevard and on Harlem Avenue in the Village is hereby established as follows:
Each twenty five feet (25') of frontage in the Village shall be numbered from
Madison Street as a baseline, beginning with number 2 on Austin Boulevard and
with number 1 on Harlem Avenue at the north line of Madison Street and
increasing toward the north, and beginning with number 2 on Austin Boulevard
and with number 1 on Harlem Avenue at the south line of Madison Street and

nearly as practicable, as that now adopted by the city of Chicago and
applicable to the east side of Austin Boulevard. (1981 Code)

authorized by this Section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as
set forth in Section

maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the

this Article and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the

22-12-4A of this Section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this
Article shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications

credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this Article, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the Village Manager may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three (3) years
after the date of the erroneous payment unless: 1) the credit is used only to
offset a claim of underpayment made by the Village within the applicable
statutory period of limitations, and 2) the credit derives from an overpayment
made by the same telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory
period of limitations.
   F.   Amounts paid under this Article by telecommunications retailers shall
not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described
immediately below:

   G.   The Village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books
and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this Article to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
Village for the Village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the
amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village plus five percent (5%)
of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs

maintenance of acquired art and/or acceptance, placement and maintenance of
temporarily placed, privately owned (including loaned) artwork on Village
property shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
   A.   Artistic Quality: The artist's concept, vision and craftsmanship for
the artwork are of strong artistic quality.
   B.   Site: The artwork and site are appropriate in scale, materials, form
and content for the immediate, general, social and physical environments with
which they are to relate.
   C.   Permanence: Due consideration shall be given to the structural and
surface soundness and to inherent resistance to theft, vandalism, weathering
and excessive maintenance or repair costs.
   D.   Public Safety: Each work shall be evaluated to ensure that it does not
present a hazard to public safety.
   E.   Diversity: P.A.A.C., when soliciting artwork, shall seek artwork from
artists of diverse racial, sexual and cultural identities. The program shall
also strive for diversity in style, scale, media and numbers of artists
represented. There shall be encouragement of exploratory types of work as well
as established art forms.
   F.   Feasibility: Proposals shall be evaluated relative to their feasibility
and convincing evidence of the artist's ability to successfully complete the
work as proposed. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to:
project, budget, time line, artist's experience, soundness of materials,
zoning/construction/design guidelines.
   G.   Duplication: Artists are required to warrant that artwork is unique and
an edition of one or part of a limited edition.
   H.   Maintenance And Preservation: The P.A.A.C. shall consider the costs for
installation, site preparation, insurance and maintenance, and evaluate whether
there are sufficient funds in the Acquisition and Maintenance Fund or from
other sources to pay these costs. Where feasible, donors and sellers shall
provide a report on future maintenance, including a plan for routine care, with
itemized estimated costs including the number of persons and special equipment
or vehicles necessary to site move the work. Where feasible or appropriate, the
P.A.A.C. shall also consider the ability of the seller, donor or artist to
provide the Village with an artist's "waiver" (as defined herein) or written
permission for maintenance work by a qualified conservator.
   I.   Purchase: In the case of public artwork to be acquired by purchase, the
reasonableness of the purchase price or rent amount in relation to the
appraised value of such public art and the sources available for such

(Ord. 2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-6: GUIDELINES FOR SITE LOCATION OF PUBLIC ARTWORK ON VILLAGE PROPERTY:
P.A.A.C. shall consider the following guidelines when choosing the site
locations on Village property of public artwork:

of the artwork on Village property to the Village Board within the parameters
established by the Director of Public Works or the Director's designee.
   B.   Public artwork shall, whenever possible, be distributed throughout the
Village.
   C.   Public artwork shall, whenever possible, be located in sites that are
generally accessible and visible to the public.
P.A.A.C. may recommend to the applicant, during a preliminary conference,
appropriate alternative sites to the site set forth in the application. If the
applicant agrees to the alternate site or sites during these preliminary
discussions, the notice and P.A.A.C. meeting process set forth in Section 22-
13-4 of this Article shall proceed based upon an amended application containing
the agreed upon alternative site location. (Ord. 2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-7: ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC ARTWORK:
In addition to the general factors set forth above, P.A.A.C. should consider
the following factors in relation to the acceptance, placement and maintenance
of permanent gifts of public artwork:
   A.   Under extraordinary circumstances, such as the high cost of maintenance
for a given artwork, P.A.A.C. may recommend conditions of accepting a gift of
such artwork, including establishment by the donor of a maintenance endowment
to ensure adequate care for the artwork.
   B.   Acquisitions shall be accepted only when accompanied by a legal
instrument of conveyance of title, listing any conditions of the acquisition
that the Village has agreed to accept and the appropriate warranty of
originality. In general, acquisitions shall be accepted without restrictions as
to the future use or disposition. P.A.A.C. shall forward copies of the
conveyance of title and the appraisal for donated artworks to the Village Risk
Manager. P.A.A.C. shall forward copies of the conveyance of title and the
stated insurance value for acquired artworks to the Village Risk Manager. (Ord.
2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-8: GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATELY OWNED ARTWORK TEMPORARILY PLACED ON VILLAGE
PROPERTY (INCLUDING LOANED ARTWORK):
In considering the temporary acceptance, placement, and maintenance of
privately owned (including loaned artwork), in addition to the general factors
set forth in Section
22-13-5 of this Article, P.A.A.C. shall also consider the following guidelines:
   A.   The owner of the artwork be required to affix the artwork to the
Village property and maintain same at the owner's expense and in accordance
with the direction and approval of the Director of Public Works or the
Director's designee.
   B.   The owner submit such construction detail plans as the Director of
Public Works may require prior to construction detailing that the artwork shall
be affixed to the public way in such a manner as to assure that the artwork
cannot be moved or removed by passersby and to assure that when it is removed
by the owner, the public way can be easily restored by the owner to its
original condition.
   C.   The owner shall save and hold harmless the Village from any and all
liability or loss for any personal injury or damage to property which may
result from the installation and maintenance of said temporary artwork on
Village property and release the Village from any and all liability for damage
to or loss of the temporary artwork which may result from the placement of the
temporary artwork on Village property. The owner shall provide the Village
with: 1) a certificate of insurance for liability insurance in the amount of
one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence, naming the Village as an
additional insured, which shall remain in full force and effect for the full
term of this agreement, and 2) a one hundred dollar ($100.00) restoration
deposit which shall be refunded to the owner after the owner's public artwork
has been removed and the Village property restored to its original condition by
the owner.
   D.   The Village shall provide the owner with temporary access to Village
property for display of the owner's artwork through the execution of a License
Agreement with the owner, granting the owner a license to use the public way
for the placement of the owner's artwork for a term of one year, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth hereinabove. After one hundred twenty (120) days
have elapsed, either party shall have the right to terminate such License
Agreement and remove said artwork upon giving sixty (60) days' written notice
to the other party of its intention to terminate the Agreement. Any notice
required therein shall be delivered by certified mail to the Village at 123
Madison Street, Oak Park, Illinois 60302-4272, and to the owner at the owner's
given mailing address. In the event of termination, the owner shall be
responsible for removing the artwork from the public way and restoring the
public way to the condition in which it existed prior to the installation of
the artwork. The Village may, however, remove the artwork at any time if it
determines, in its sole discretion, that the artwork represents a hazard to
public health and safety. In the event of such a removal, the Village shall
return the artwork to the owner as soon after the removal as is practicable.
Due to the fact that the Village deems the display of the artwork by the owner
to be primarily a public benefit enhancing the aesthetic appearance of Village
property, the Village shall waive any fee it would otherwise charge for the use
of Village property.
The owner may renew such License Agreement under the same terms and conditions
for an additional one year term on an annual basis by providing the Village
with written notice of the owner's intention and offer to renew the Agreement
at least ninety (90) days prior to the termination of the then current
Agreement and at the same time providing the Village with a new certificate of
insurance which complies with the terms of the Agreement and which extends
coverage for the full term of the renewal period. In order to extend the
Agreement, the Village must provide the owner with written acceptance of the
owner's offer to extend the Agreement for an additional one year term at least
sixty (60) days prior to the termination of the existing term of the Agreement.
All renewals of the Agreement shall, however, remain subject to the termination
provisions of the original Agreement. The Village's failure to provide the
owner with written acceptance by the Village of the owner's notice and offer to
extend the Agreement for one year at least sixty (60) days prior to the
termination date of the existing Agreement shall constitute a termination of
the Agreement by the Village, which shall take effect at the end of the term of
the then existing Agreement.
   E.   If the President and Board of Trustees determine that it is in the
public interest to do so, they may waive, by resolution of the Board setting
forth findings with regard to same, any or all of the requirements set forth in
this Section. (Ord. 2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-9: P.A.A.C. RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES:
At the conclusion of the meeting at which an applicant's application has been
considered and all interested parties have had an opportunity to comment
thereon, P.A.A.C. shall vote to approve or deny the application.
If P.A.A.C. votes to deny said application, the decision of P.A.A.C. shall be
final. If P.A.A.C. votes to approve said application, it shall forward a
recommendation to the President and Board of Trustees with regard to the
acceptance, placement and maintenance of the subject public artwork, together
with findings, supporting documentation and such other conditions and
restrictions as P.A.A.C. deems appropriate. In the case of an application to
acquire public art by purchase or rental, the recommendation shall also include
a recommended purchase price or rent amount, an appraisal and recommended
sources of funding. (Ord. 2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-10: FINAL ACTION BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES:
Upon receipt of a recommendation from P.A.A.C., the President and Board of
Trustees, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, shall vote to accept,
reject or modify the findings and recommendations of P.A.A.C. In considering
the recommendation of P.A.A.C., the Village Board shall accept the judgment of
P.A.A.C. on artistic matters and will not exercise its independent judgment
with regard to same.
If the Village Board rejects the recommendation of P.A.A.C., such rejection
will serve as the final decision of the Village. The applicant shall be
prohibited from filing the same or similar application for a period of one year
from the date of the rejection.
If the Village Board accepts the recommendation of P.A.A.C. as presented or as
modified by the Board with regard to the acquisition or temporary loan of
public artwork, the Village Board shall do so by adopting a resolution
authorizing and directing the Village Manager to acquire or receive the
temporary loan of such public artwork and directing the manner and site
location for placing and affixing of the public artwork to Village property and
the manner in which it shall be maintained. If the acquisition of the public
art is by purchase the resolutions shall also establish the purchase price. If
the Village Board accepts the recommendation of P.A.A.C. as presented or as
modified by the Board with regard to the temporary placement of a privately
owned artwork on public property, the Board shall do so by resolution
authorizing and directing the Village Manager to permit the temporary placement
of such privately owned artwork on public property and, except under
circumstances where the Board finds it otherwise appropriate and reasonable, to
further authorize and direct the Village Manager to enter into a temporary
License Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions recommended in the
guidelines found in Section
22-13-8 of this Article. (Ord. 2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-11: PUBLIC ARTWORK PLAQUE:
The only items of information which may be displayed with public artwork are
the name of the artist, the title of the artwork and the year in which it was
created, on a plaque of brass or other similar material in letters and numbers
which do not exceed three-fourths (3/4) of an inch in height. (Ord. 2001-0-75,
9-4-01)
22-13-12: RELOCATION OR REMOVAL OF PUBLIC ARTWORK:
   A.   P.A.A.C. shall inspect all existing public artwork on an annual basis
to assess the condition of same.
   B.   P.A.A.C. may recommend relocation of public artwork for one or more of
the following reasons:
      1.   The condition or security of the artwork can no longer be reasonably
guaranteed at its current site.
      2.   The artwork has become a danger to public safety in its current
site.
      3.   The site has changed so that the artwork is no longer compatible
with the site.
In the case of an unconditional, permanent acquisition of public artwork which
qualifies for relocation hereunder, P.A.A.C. will, nevertheless, attempt to
obtain approval from the artist prior to recommending relocation. If it is
unable to obtain the approval of the artist, P.A.A.C. may still recommend and
the Village Board may authorize relocation of the public artwork to another
public site. In the case of temporarily placed privately owned artwork which
qualifies for relocation, P.A.A.C. will seek the permission of the owner to
relocate same.
If P.A.A.C. is unable to obtain the permission of the private owner to relocate
the artwork, P.A.A.C. may recommend and the Village may authorize removal of
the artwork from Village property.
   C.   P.A.A.C. may recommend removal of artwork from Village property for one
or more of the following reasons:
      1.   Physical deterioration and damage;
      2.   Excessive cost of maintenance;
      3.   Incompatibility with the site or neighborhood, with no alternative
site or neighborhood available.
In the case of public artwork which qualifies for removal hereunder, P.A.A.C.
will make a good faith effort to notify the artist and/or donor and the artist
and/or donor shall be given the opportunity to reacquire title to the artwork
prior to its removal and final disposition, which may result in Board
authorized storage, sale, exchange, gift or destruction.
In the case of temporarily placed, privately owned artwork which qualifies for
removal hereunder, the Village shall store said artwork in a safe and secure
location for sixty (60) days during which time said owner must retrieve the
owner's public artwork.
Upon removal of temporarily placed, privately owned artwork from the public
site, the Village shall provide written notice to the owner of said public
artwork of the date and time of the Village's removal of said public artwork
and the location of the place at which said public artwork is stored and the
time period and hours of the day within which the public artwork may be picked
up from said location and said notice shall further indicate if the artworks
are not picked up within said time frame that the public artworks shall become
the property of the Village and that the Village may retain the public artwork
as it sees fit or it may declare the public artwork as surplus property and
dispose of same in the manner directed by ordinance. At the conclusion of the
sixty (60) day period, the Village Board may declare the artwork as surplus and
dispose of same in the manner prescribed by ordinance.
   D.   In all cases where removal, relocation or alteration of public artwork
is considered by the P.A.A.C. and the Village, the P.A.A.C. and the Village
shall abide by the Federal Visual Artists' Rights Act of 1990. (Ord. 2001-0-75,
9-4-01)
22-13-13: ACQUISITION AND MAINTENANCE FUND:
A general public artworks acquisition and maintenance fund shall be established
by the Village to acquire and maintain public artworks. Funds from any special
endowment fund that has been established for a specific artwork may be
transferred to the general public artworks acquisition and maintenance fund if
that artwork has been removed from the public artworks collection. Proceeds of
all sales of public artworks shall be deposited in the acquisition and
maintenance fund. The President and Board of Trustees shall on an annual basis
determine the extent to which the Village will designate funds for the Public
Art Acquisition and Maintenance Fund and shall consider the recommendations and
supporting acquisition and maintenance plan and cost analysis of the Public Art
Advisory Commission in making its determination. (Ord. 2001-0-75, 9-4-01)
22-13-14: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, chapter, provision, or phrase of

22-14-8: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Public Safety Technology: A wireless provider's operation of a small
wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
Village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this Code.
   B.   Restrictions: A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any
wireless facility that:
      1.   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a
right-of-way;
      2.   Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
      3.   Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;
      4.   Violates or conflicts with any provision of this Code or other
applicable ordinance or regulation adopted by the Village, except to the extent
such provision, ordinance or regulation may be modified by the provisions of
this article; or
      5.   Violates the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USC
section 12101 et seq.
   C.   Contractual Requirements: Wireless providers shall comply with all
requirements imposed by a contract between the Village and any private property
owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles
and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.

if any, that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing
utility poles or equipment in the right-of-way.
      1.   Waiver: A wireless provider may receive a waiver from the Village
Manager or the Manager's designee to allow wireless facilities to be located
above ground in an area where this Code, Village ordinances or regulations
prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if the wireless provider can
establish that:
         a.   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no
reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-
way;
         b.   An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location is
necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
         c.   An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will
not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety hazard;
         d.   An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will
not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies;
         e.   Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the
above ground wireless facility at the proposed location;
         f.   An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will
not create a safety hazard;
         g.   The above ground wireless facility is located and designed in
such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on adjacent properties; and
         h.   In any historical area, that the above ground wireless facility
will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of the area.
      2.   Screening For Ground Mounted Facilities: Where a ground- mounted
facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in
accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape engineer
and approved by the Village Manager or the Manager's designee. The owner or
wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance of all landscaping as
provided in the approved landscape plan.
      3.   Future Undergrounding: The Village may determine to eliminate above-
ground utility poles of a particular type generally. In the event that such a
utility pole has a collocated small wireless facility in place at the time of
such a determination, the Village shall either:
         a.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         b.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   F.   Collocation Limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small
wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. However, the antenna and
support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the
communications space on the Village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if
not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable
codes for work involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this subsection,
the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and
"electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National
Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers.
   G.   Code Compliance: Wireless providers shall comply with applicable codes
and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. (Ord. 18-

23A-1-2: IMPOSITION OF TAX:
A tax is imposed on the transfer of title to real estate located in the Village
as evidenced by the recordation of a deed by any person or by the delivery of
any deed or assignment of interest of said real property, whether investing the
owner with the beneficial interest in or legal title to said property or merely
the possession or use thereof for any purpose or to secure future payment of
money or the future transfer of any such real property.
The tax imposed shall be eight dollars ($8.00) for every one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) value or fraction thereof as stated in the declaration. (Ord. 1986-
0-23, 4-7-1986; amd. Ord. 1993-0-7, 1-19-1993)
23A-1-3: PRIMARY LIABILITY FOR TAX:
The primary liability for payment of said tax shall be borne by the grantor or
seller involved in any such transaction; provided, however, it shall be
unlawful for the grantee or purchaser to accept a conveyance if the transfer
tax has not been paid. If the tax has not been paid and the stamps affixed to
the deed, then the grantee's title shall be subject to the lien provided in
section 23A-1-11 of this article and the grantee or purchaser shall be liable

power of direction to deal with the title to the real estate under a land trust

caused to be prepared by said Director of Finance in such quantities as said
Director of Finance may from time to time prescribe.
The stamp shall be generated from a tax meter machine on a thermally printed
self-adhesive tape and include the following:
The name of the Village of Oak Park.

Amount of the real estate transfer tax.
Serial number of the transaction.
Such revenue stamps shall be available for sale at and during the regular

Director of Finance. Upon payment of the tax herein levied and imposed, the
revenue stamps so purchased shall be affixed to the deed or other instrument of
conveyance. Any person so using and affixing a revenue stamp or stamps shall
cancel it and so deface it as to render it unfit for reuse by marking it with
his initials and the day, month and year when the affixing occurs. Such
markings shall be made by writing or stamping in indelible ink or by
perforating with a machine or punch. However, the revenue stamp(s) shall not be
so defaced as to prevent ready determination of its denomination and
genuineness.
   B.   The Director of Finance shall issue no revenue stamps unless both of
the following conditions are met:
      1.   The Account Supervisor of the Water Division issues a certificate of
payment showing that all water and sewer assessments are paid in full or
otherwise issues a waiver of certification issued pursuant to rules and
regulations promulgated by the Director of Finance and in accordance with the
requirements set forth hereinbelow:
A waiver of certification may only be issued when:
         a.   A deposit is made with the Account Supervisor or his/her designee
in an amount determined by the Account Supervisor to be adequate to satisfy the
water bill in full after the final reading has been taken;
         b.   Arrangements are made with the Account Supervisor or his/her
designee to pay the water bill in full out of the sale proceeds at closing;
         c.   Evidence is presented, indicating to the satisfaction of the
Account Supervisor that the bill has been paid or that the bill is incorrect at
least with regard to the unpaid balance set forth thereon and that no unpaid
balance is due and owing on the water bill; or
         d.   As otherwise specifically set forth in the rules and regulations
promulgated by the Director of Finance.
      2.   The seller has obtained a release, executed by the Village Manager

23A-1-11: LIEN CREATED; ENFORCEMENT:
In the event a deed is filed for recordation or there is an assignment of
beneficial interest conveying real estate within the corporate limits of the
Village without the revenue stamps provided by this article, a lien is declared
against said real estate conveyed in the amount of the tax. The fact that the
deed or assignment does not contain an Oak Park revenue stamp in an amount
equal to five (5) times the amount of county and state transfer taxes shall
constitute constructive notice of lien. The lien may be enforced by proceedings
to foreclose, as in cases of mortgages or mechanics' liens. Suit to foreclose
this lien must be commenced within three (3) years after the date of recording
the deed. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the Village from
bringing a civil action to collect the tax imposed by this article from any
person who has the ultimate liability for payment of the same, including
interest and penalties as hereinbelow provided. (Ord. 1983-0-77, 11-21-1983)

accumulate and be due upon said tax at the rate of one percent (1%) per month

addition, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the tax and interest due shall be

constitution or statutes of the state of Illinois.
      4.   The tax shall be imposed with respect to the use or consumption of
electricity by residential customers beginning with the first bill issued on or

   C.   Collection Of Tax:
      1.   Subject to the provisions of subsection
23A-9-10E of this section regarding the delivery of electricity to resellers,
the tax imposed under this section shall be collected from purchasers by the
person maintaining a place of business in this state who delivers electricity
to such purchasers. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the
person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and is recoverable at the
same time and in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity.
      2.   Any tax required to be collected by this article, and any tax in
fact collected, shall constitute a debt owed to the Village by the person
delivering the electricity, provided, that the person delivering electricity
shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity the
charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and provided further, that
if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be
obligated to remit such tax.
      3.   Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the
purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the
electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to
such gross charge an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the tax they collect
to reimburse them for their expenses incurred in keeping records, billing
customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data
to the Village upon request. For purposes of this section, any partial payment
of a billed amount not specifically identified by the purchaser shall be deemed
to be for the delivery of electricity.
   D.   Tax Remittance And Return:
      1.   Every tax collector shall on a monthly basis file a return in a form
prescribed by the Village's Director of Finance. The return and accompanying
remittance shall be due on or before the last day of the month following the
month during which the tax is collected.
      2.   If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from
the purchaser then the purchaser shall file a return in a form prescribed by
the Village's Director of Finance and pay the tax directly to the Village on or
before the last day of the month following the month during which the
electricity is used or consumed.
   E.   Resales:
      1.   Electricity that is delivered to a person in this Village shall be
considered to be for use and consumption by that person unless the person
receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the Village and
furnishes that number to the person who delivers the electricity, and certifies
to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially nontaxable as a
sale for resale.
      2.   If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the Village for
a resale number. The applicant shall state facts showing why it is not liable
for the tax imposed by this section on any purchases of electricity and shall
furnish such additional information as the Village may reasonably require.
      3.   Upon approval of the application, the Village shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant.
      4.   The Village may cancel the resale number of any person if the person
fails to pay any tax payable under this chapter for electricity used or
consumed by the person, or if the number: a) was obtained through
misrepresentation; or b) is no longer necessary because the person has
discontinued making resales.
      5.   a.    If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or
consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by
this section directly to the Village pursuant to subsection
23A-9-10D2 of this section or this subsection
23A-9-10E on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and
shall collect the tax pursuant to subsection
23A-9-10D2 of this section or this subsection
23A-9-10E and remit the tax pursuant to subsection
23A-9-10D1 of this section or this subsection
23A-9-10E on the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a
purchaser.
         b.   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an
active resale number and complying with all other conditions of this section
shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the
electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the
Village the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and such
other information that the Village may reasonably require.
   F.   Books And Records: Every tax collector, and every taxpayer required to
pay the tax imposed by this section, shall keep accurate books and records of
its business or activity, including contemporaneous books and records denoting
the transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability
under this section. The books and records shall be subject to and available for
inspection at all times during business hours of the day.
   G.   Credits And Refunds: Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, in order to permit sound fiscal planning and budgeting by the Village,
no person shall be entitled to a refund of, or credit for, a tax imposed under
this section unless the person files a claim for refund or credit within one
year after the date on which the tax was paid or remitted. (Ord. 16-150, 11-21-

cents ($2.50) shall be charged.
24-3-11: DIAL TO BE ILLUMINATED AND LOCATED IN PLAIN VIEW OF PASSENGER:
Each taxicab shall, during the period between sunset and sunrise, be equipped
with a light which shall be so reflected upon the dial of the taximeter as to
enable the passenger engaging and using such taxicab to read the figures
indicated thereon.
Every taximeter placed on a taxicab shall be so arranged that the dial thereof
is in plain view of the passenger while riding in such taxicab, or upon
alighting from the same.
24-3-12: FALSE SIGNALS:
No driver of a taxicab equipped with a taximeter while carrying a passenger or
under employment shall display the signal affixed to such taximeter or other

26-2-4: DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS; SHUTOFF; RECONNECTION FEE; DEPOSIT; RENTAL UNITS:
   A.   Whenever any charges under this Article shall remain unpaid for a
period of more than thirty (30) days from the date of the statement herein
provided for, and the Village has provided notice to the delinquent consumer of
its intention to turn off the water supply to the consumer due to such
nonpayment and has provided the consumer with an opportunity for a hearing to
present reasons why the water should not be turned off, and the consumer either
fails to request a hearing or fails to provide adequate reasons to prevent the
water shutoff, then the water shall be turned off from the premises of such
delinquent consumer and the service shall not be resumed until the following
has occurred:
      1.   All water bills in arrears have been paid;
      2.   A reconnection fee is paid. The charge shall be fifty dollars
($50.00) for the services of the Water Division in turning the water off and on
if said reconnection is made during working hours (7:00 A.M. to 2:30 P.M.) and
one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) if said reconnection is made after working
hours, or on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday; and
      3.   A deposit equal to one-sixth (1/6) of the last actual or estimated
annual water bill has been paid. In the case of tenants already required to
make deposits in accordance with Section
26-2-6 of this Article, the deposit required herein shall be in addition to the
deposit required under Section
26-2-6 of this Article. The deposit shall be refunded to the consumer at the
time the water service is terminated, provided that there are no water charges
due and unpaid at that time. If there are unpaid water charges due at the time
the water service is terminated, the deposit shall first be applied to the
unpaid water charges and any remaining deposit funds shall be returned to the
consumer.
The Director of Finance shall cause all notices of water shutoff to be mailed
by first class mail, delivered or posted at the mailing address of the water
consumer listed in the Village water billing records not less than ten (10)
days prior to the scheduled date of the water shutoff. Copies of said notice
shall also be delivered to the Village's Community Relations Department and to
all social service or housing agencies that may be subsidizing the rent for any
dwelling unit affected by the impending water shutoff. The Director of Finance
shall designate a supervisory employee of the Finance Department to act as a
hearing officer with regard to water shut-off hearings.
The notice of water shutoff shall indicate the date of the water shutoff, the
amount of the delinquency which must be satisfied, the place and manner in
which the payment of such delinquent amount must be made, or the time, place
and manner in which to request a hearing at which the consumer can provide the
designated hearing officer with reasons why the consumer's water should not be
shut off. All requests for hearings must occur during the ten (10) day period
prior to the scheduled date of the water shutoff. The notice shall conform in
all other respects to the requirements set forth in 765 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 735/3. Reasons which will prevent a water shutoff from occurring shall
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         a.   A mistake in the water bill or water bill amount;
         b.   A payment of the water bill amount shown as due and owing on the
face of the water bill; and/or
         c.   A serious public health and safety hazard which will prevent the
water shutoff.
If the hearing officer determines that the reasons presented by the consumer
for not turning off the water are valid, the hearing officer shall provide the
consumer with written notice of the hearing officer's decision as soon as
possible but no later than seventy two (72) hours after the completion of the
hearing, and shall cancel the water shutoff and shall order whatever Village
record corrections are necessary to reflect the fact that the consumer is not
subject to water shutoff at that time. No water shutoff shall occur during the
pendency of a water shut-off hearing.
No person owing water charges and moving to other premises within the Village
where there are water connections or where connections shall afterwards be
made, shall be supplied with water until such charges in arrears are paid in
full.
   B.   Whenever, pursuant to any agreement, either written or verbal, a
landlord or the landlord's agent is required to pay for water service, and the
landlord or the landlord's agent does not pay for such service, the tenant, or
tenants in the event more than one tenant is served by a common system of water
service which goes through a common meter in a single building, may pay for
such service if the nonpayment jeopardizes the continuation of the service to
the tenant or tenants, as the case may be. The Village shall not terminate
service for such nonpayment until it mails, delivers or posts a notice in the
same manner as specified in subsection 26-2-4A of this section to all tenants
of a building. Upon receipt of such payment of the past due cost of such water
service owed by the landlord, the Village shall immediately restore service to
such tenant or tenants. In the alternative, the Village shall immediately
restore and continue such service to any tenant or tenants who enter into a
payment plan agreement with the Village to pay the delinquent balance on the
landlord's water bill within a reasonable period of time to be determined by
the Director of Finance. In the event of a default on any such agreement by a
party or parties thereto failing to make payments to the Village on the
delinquent water bill in accordance with the terms and payment schedule set
forth therein, no further notice shall be required of the Village prior to
shutting off the water service. Any sums the tenant or tenants, as the case may
be, pays for water service that the landlord or the landlord's agent was
required to pay may be deducted from the rent due by the tenant or tenants, and
the total rent is diminished by the amount the tenant or tenants, as the case
may be, have paid for the continuation of the water service. (Ord. 2000-0-32,
6-19-00)
26-2-5: COMPUTATION OF CHARGES WHEN METER FAILS:
Whenever any meter, by reason of its being out of repair, or for any cause,
fails to properly register the water passing through the same, the consumer
shall be charged at the rate shown for a corresponding time of a previous year
under like conditions. If no record of a previous year exists, then it shall be
the duty of the Director of Finance to estimate or determine so far as he or
she can, the amount of water consumed during the time such meter fails to
operate, and the consumer shall pay the amount estimated by the Director of
Finance. (Ord. 2000-0-32, 6-19-00)
26-2-6: RESPONSIBILITY FOR WATER REGISTERED BY METER; TENANT DEPOSIT REQUIRED:
The owner or tenant of premises supplied with water will be held responsible
for all water registered by the meter. No reduction shall be made or rebate
allowed to any consumer on account of leakage, or alleged leakage, in any pipe,
tank or other apparatus or device.
   A.   Tenant Deposit: Tenants of premises who are required by their lease to
pay water charges shall be required to deposit with the Village a sum equal to
one quarter's estimated maximum water bill for the leased premises. Said sum
shall be refunded to the tenant when the lease has been terminated, provided
there are no water charges due at that time. (Ord. 2000-0-32, 6-19-00)
   B.   Meter Testing And Fees: Effective January 1, 2010, customers may
request that the Village test their meters. If a tested meter is found to be
running accurately or slow, the customer must pay for the meter test. All
customers requesting a meter test shall make a cash deposit at the time of the
request to cover the cost of the test.
Customers requesting a meter test for five-eighths inch (5/8") through two inch
(2") disk meters shall provide the Village with a one hundred dollar ($100.00)
deposit. After the Village has received this deposit, the Village will pull and
test the meter, and temporarily install a new pretested meter in its place.
If the test results show the meter to be running fast according to AWWA
standards, the Village will return the one hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit to
the customer and leave the newly installed meter in place. In addition to the
deposit refund, the water bill for the current billing cycle will also be
adjusted to reflect the accurate rate at which the meter should have been
measuring the flow of water.
If the test results show that the meter is running accurately or running slow
according to AWWA standards, the Village will retain the one hundred dollar
($100.00) deposit. If the tested meter is found to be running accurately, the
Village at its discretion will either leave the new meter in place or service
and reinstall the old meter. If the tested meter is found to be running slowly,
the Village will leave the newly installed meter in place and will adjust the
water bill for the current billing cycle to reflect the accurate rate at which
the meter should have been measuring the flow of water.
If for any reason the customer is not satisfied with the test results from the
Village, the Village will, at the customer's option, send the meter out to be
tested by an outside contractor at the customer's expense.
All compound meters will be tested at the Village's expense, except when a test
is specifically requested by an owner or customer. If an owner or customer
requests a meter test for a compound meter, the cost for the test will be
charged to that owner or customer, and the charge will equal the total cost to
the Village to have the meter tested. (Ord. 2009-0-093, 11-23-09)
26-2-7: FINAL AND INITIAL METER READINGS REQUIRED:
Any person who shall vacate any premises or any person who shall enter upon or
occupy any premises, shall immediately, before vacating or occupying such
premises, notify the Water Division and secure a reading of the meter. (Ord.
2000-0-32, 6-19-00)
26-2-8: TWO OR MORE METERS ON ONE SERVICE:
Property owners may have, at the option of the Water Division, more than one
meter installed in one building, on one service and controlled by a single
round way in the parkway; provided, the meters are not connected in tandem.
Nothing less than the minimum charge will be made for each meter so installed,
and the bills for the whole supply furnished through such service shall be made
to the owner of the premises. (Ord. 2000-0-32, 6-19-00)

property; provided, however, water service shall only be shut off in accordance
with the notice and hearing procedures set forth in section

the issuance of a license hereunder, at once become binding on him."

herein; provided, however, that in the case of a divided load, by which is
meant a load containing more than one order for the same or different
purchasers or consignees, no penalty shall be imposed under this Article by

separate order or delivery is correctly shown on the weight certificate and
such correct net weight is delivered.

lot to be weighed by another person licensed as a public weighmaster, and is
not interested directly or indirectly with such other public weighmaster in the
operation of such public weighmaster's scale, it shall be the duty of the
person delivering such load and of the driver or person in charge of the
vehicle used in the delivery thereof, upon the request of the purchaser or
consignee, or the Inspector of Weights and Measures or of any deputies, to
convey such load to some scale selected by such purchaser or consignee, or by
the Inspector of Weights and Measures or such deputy, and permit the weighing
of the gross weight of such load, and after the delivery of such load, to

person selling or delivering such solid fuel shall provide the driver of the
wagon, truck or other conveyance in which the same is transported, with a
delivery ticket made out in conformity with the provisions of this Article and

Article, or with a ticket or memorandum which does not give the result of the
actual weighing of such solid fuel, and any such driver and any such persons
making or attempting to make delivery of any solid fuel, who shall produce,
deliver, offer or tender any ticket or memorandum which does not correctly give
the information aforesaid, or does not give the result of the actual weighing
of such solid fuel, and any person delivering or attempting to deliver solid

violation of the specific code provision(s) found to have been violated.
However, in no event shall an Administrative Law Judge have authority to: a)
impose a penalty of incarceration, or b) impose a fine in excess of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) exclusive of costs of enforcement or costs
imposed to secure compliance with this code, except, however, that the maximum
fine amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) does not apply to cases
brought to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and collected by the
Village.
When applicable, each day a code provision is found to have been violated by
the respondent shall constitute a separate offense, and each separate offense
subjects the respondent to the fine and penalty provided by the governing
penalty provision.
      2.   The Village recognizes the critical role families play in the
rehabilitation of troubled minors. Therefore, Administrative Law Judges shall
have the authority to order parents, guardians and legal custodians to
participate in any community based education, counseling or treatment program
which their minor child or minor ward has been ordered to attend to assist the
minor in recognizing and accepting responsibility for his or her behavior.
Administrative Law Judges may also order the parents, guardian or legal
custodian to take certain actions or to refrain from certain actions to serve

Judge, provided, however, that an Administrative Law Judge is authorized to
waive the fine and/or costs that otherwise would be imposed upon finding a
respondent liable for one or more code violations, other than violations of
chapter 15 of this code, when the Administrative Law Judge specifically finds
as a matter of fact that the violation(s) occurred under such circumstances as
to a reasonable person would constitute an excuse for the violation(s). (Ord.
2003-0-42, 10-7-2003)
29-1-10: SUBPOENAS:
   A.   Issuance: Subpoenas shall only be enforceable for the attendance of
persons or the production of books, records or other documents that have a
relevant evidentiary connection with the: 1) subject matter, and 2) facts which

with a subpoena issued in accordance with this chapter, the person or entity to
whom the subpoena is directed may contest the issuance of the subpoena by
filing a written motion with the Office of Adjudication, and with proper notice
to all parties. The motion shall specify the grounds therefor, and shall be
heard by an Administrative Law Judge on the return date indicated on the

earlier. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-03)

fair opportunity to be heard.
   B.   All administrative hearings shall be conducted on the date set for
hearing. For good cause shown, a case may be continued at the discretion of the
Administrative Law Judge. The purpose of administrative hearings is to provide

Administrative Law Judge, the Administrative Law Judge may order that
proceeding designated to be conducted by remote electronic means shall be
conducted in-person when doing so is necessary or efficient to protect the
rights of any party and can be accomplished without compromising the safety of
the proceedings and its participants.
   D.   No violation may be established except upon proof by a preponderance of

code, shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts specified
therein.
   E.   No agent or employee of the Office of Adjudication shall represent the
Village or present evidence or testimony at an adjudicatory hearing. Provided,
however, documentary evidence, prepared by another Department of the Village

the Administrative Law Judge. This section does not preclude employees or
agents of the Village of Oak Park, other than employees of the Office of
Adjudication, from appearing at a hearing or presenting evidence.
   F.   Parties to an adjudicatory hearing may be represented by an attorney,
present witnesses, and cross examine opposing witnesses. Parties may request
the Administrative Law Judge to issue subpoenas as provided for in section

   G.   The Administrative Law Judge may question witnesses and elicit
testimony in order to determine whether the respondent is liable for the
charged violation.
   H.   A record of all hearings shall be kept. The record shall be preserved
in such form and manner as determined by the Director. Such preservation may be
made by tape recording or other appropriate means. Recording by any means by
any member of the public is prohibited unless expressly authorized by the
Director. The record of all hearings before an Administrative Law Judge shall
include: 1) a record of the testimony presented at the hearing; 2) all
documents, exhibits, and other physical evidence presented at the hearing and
admitted into evidence; 3) a copy of the notice of violation and notice of
hearing; and 4) a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's findings, decision,
and order. Any party may request that the proceedings be taken and transcribed
by a certified court reporter. The cost of the court reporter shall be borne by
the party requesting the court reporter. If the Village makes a tape recording
of the proceedings, the respondent may obtain a transcript at his or her own
cost.
   I.   At the conclusion of a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall
issue a final determination. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that
the respondent is liable for the violation, he or she may impose fines, assess
costs, and make all orders authorized by section
29-1-9 of this article.
   J.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall
inform the parties orally and in writing of the determination, which
determination shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial
review. The Administrative Law Judge also may dismiss the case with or without
prejudice on a properly made motion by the Village.
   K.   Final determinations of an Administrative Law Judge are subject to
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-03;
amd. Ord. 20-171, 7-6-2020)
29-1-12: NOTICE OF VIOLATION; NOTICE OF HEARING; SERVICE:

jurisdiction prior to its effective date, be guilty of contempt. Contempt shall
be enforceable only by the Cook County judicial system and shall be punishable
by applicable law. Each day that the violation continues shall be considered a

applicable to the violation. A copy of the default judgment, which is a final
determination, shall be mailed to the respondent along with a notice apprising
the respondent of the procedure for setting aside the default judgment and also
shall apprise the respondent of the availability of an appeal of the default
judgment to the Circuit Court of Cook County. The default judgment and notice
of judgment shall be promptly served on the respondent as provided by
subsection
29-1-12C1 of this article.
   B.   A respondent against whom a default judgment has been entered may file
a motion with the Office of Adjudication to set aside the default judgment and
for a new hearing. A motion to set aside a default judgment may be filed at any
time if the respondent alleges lack of subject matter or personal jurisdiction;
in all other cases, the motion must be filed within twenty one (21) days of
entry of the default judgment, provided however, that if the twenty first day
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the time for filing a motion
will expire on the next business day. A motion to set aside a default judgment
shall set forth the reason(s) the respondent failed to appear on the hearing
date at which the default judgment was entered. An Administrative Law Judge
shall hear and rule on the motion. If the Administrative Law Judge grants the
motion, a hearing will be held immediately on the alleged code violation(s) set
forth in notice of violation, citation, or other charging document unless the
respondent requests another hearing date and presents good cause for continuing
the hearing. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, a motion to
set aside a default judgment entered on a notice of violation of parking,
standing, or vehicle compliance shall be subject to the provisions of article 2
of this chapter.
   C.   If any default judgment is set aside pursuant to this section, the
Administrative Law Judge shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing
any lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the Village as a
result of the default judgment. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-03)
29-1-16: FINES; COMPLIANCE BOND:
   A.   All fines and other monies to be paid to the Village in accordance with
this chapter shall be remitted to the Village and deposited in the appropriate
Village account as designated by the Village Manager.
   B.   1. In order to ensure that code violations are remedied in a timely
manner, upon the issuance of a determination of liability that includes an
order of compliance, an Administrative Law Judge may order the respondent in
the case to obtain a bond to ensure respondent's timely compliance with the
code provision(s) found to have been violated. Any bond ordered pursuant to
this subsection
29-1-16B1 shall name the Village as beneficiary and shall be in the amount
specified by the Administrative Law Judge, provided that the amount of the bond
shall be reasonably related to the cost of compliance. Any bond issued as a
result of an Administrative Law Judge's order is subject to review and
modification by the Village Manager as to form and amount. If the respondent
fails to remedy in a timely manner the code violation(s) for which a bond has
been ordered and issued and the Village undertakes remediation or otherwise
expends funds related to the code violation(s) for which a bond has been
ordered and issued, the Administrative Law Judge, after giving the parties
notice and opportunity to be heard, may issue an order permitting the Village
to draw against the bond in an appropriate amount. The Administrative Law Judge
shall order the bond amount, less the reasonable costs incurred by the Village,
returned to the respondent upon proof of compliance with the code provision(s)
found to have been violated.
      2.   In the event a respondent ordered to secure a bond as provided by
subsection
29-1-16B1 of this section seeks judicial review of that portion of the
Administrative Law Judge's order requiring a bond and prevails on that issue,
the Village shall release the bond, and if the Village has drawn against the
bond, the Village shall refund to the respondent the total amount drawn within
thirty (30) days of receiving a copy of the reviewing court's mandate. (Ord.
2003-0-42, 10-7-03)
29-1-17: ENFORCEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S ORDER:
   A.   Any fine and any administrative, enforcement, or compliance costs
imposed by an Administrative Law Judge's order that remain unpaid after the
exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures, unless
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be a debt due and owing the
Village and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
   B.   After the expiration of the period for which judicial review may be
sought, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the determination
of liability of an Administrative Law Judge may be enforced in the same manner
as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   C.   In any case in which a respondent fails to comply with an
Administrative Law Judge's order to correct a code violation, any expenses
incurred by the Village to enforce the Administrative Law Judge's order,
including, but not limited to, the cost of demolition, repair, and/or enclosure
of dangerous or unsafe buildings or uncompleted and abandoned buildings, and
costs for the removal of garbage, debris, and other hazardous, noxious, or
unhealthy substances or materials from buildings or other real property, and
including attorney fees after they are fixed by an Administrative Law Judge,
shall be a debt due and owing the Village. Prior to any expenses being fixed by
an Administrative Law Judge pursuant to this subsection, the respondent shall
be provided with notice that directs the respondent to appear at a hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge to determine whether the respondent has
failed to comply with the Administrative Law Judge's order. The notice shall
set the date, time and place for the hearing, which shall not be less than
seven (7) days from the date the notice is served. Notice may be served by
personal service, first class mail or by an overnight commercial delivery
service and the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on the date that the
notice was personally served, deposited in the mail or placed for delivery with
the overnight commercial delivery service.
   D.   If any fine, penalty, and/or cost is owing and unpaid after a
determination of liability under this chapter has become final and the
respondent has exhausted or failed to exhaust judicial procedures for review,
the Director of the Office of Adjudication shall cause a notice of debt due and
owing to be sent to the respondent in the manner provided in subsection
29-1-12C1 of this article.
   E.   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Code
of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed
on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the respondent in the amount
of a debt due and owing the Village. The lien may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   F.   If respondent fails to pay such debt within fourteen (14) days after
service of the notice of debt, the Village may take the following actions in
addition to any debt collection authorized by law:
      1.   Decline to issue, renew or provide any license, permit, zoning
variance, or permission applied for or requested by respondent under this code
or under any other code or ordinance of the Village until respondent pays such
fine or penalty; or
      2.   Decline to issue or renew residential parking permits, temporary
residential parking permits or passes, or any other permit required and applied
for by respondent under this code or any other code or ordinance of the
Village, until respondent pays such fine or penalty.
   G.   1. When the Director becomes aware that a respondent has failed to pay
such fine or penalty within the prescribed fourteen (14) day period, he or she
shall notify the departments responsible for issuing licenses and permits as
described above that the respondent has a delinquent debt, and that no licenses
or permits may be issued to the respondent until the debt has been fully
satisfied.
      2.   At or prior to the time when a respondent applies for a license or
permit, or for a renewal of such license or permit, the department that is
responsible for issuing the license or permit shall notify the respondent that
he or she is ineligible for such license or permit issuance or renewal due to
the outstanding debt. The notice shall inform the respondent that he or she may
request a description of the outstanding debt from the Finance Department, and
shall inform the respondent of his or her right to appeal the denial of the
license or permit under this section. If notice is provided by mail, it shall
be sufficient to mail the notice to the last address the respondent provided to
the issuing department. The date of notice shall be the date the notice was
deposited in the mail, if served by first class mail; the date of delivery, if
served by personal service; or the date of service if served by any other
manner.
      3.   Upon the respondent's request, the Finance Department shall provide
the respondent with a written description of his or her outstanding debt. A
respondent shall have ten (10) business days from the date of notice to appeal
the Department's denial by requesting a hearing by the Director of
Adjudication, or his or her designee.
      4.   Requests for hearing shall be made in writing to the Director's
office. A request for hearing shall include: the full name, address and
telephone number of the respondent; a written statement signed by the
respondent setting forth facts, law or other information relevant to
establishing a defense to the Department's denial; a copy of the notice
provided to the respondent by the license/permit issuing department under this
subsection
29-1-17G; and, any documentary evidence that supports the respondent's appeal,
including receipts for the payment of an alleged debt. Upon receipt of a timely
and proper request for a hearing, the Director or his or her designee shall
assign a hearing date no later than fifteen (15) business days after the date
of request. The hearing shall not be continued without the consent of the
respondent. The Director, or his or her designee, shall determine whether or
not the respondent is ineligible for a license/permit pursuant to this section.
The hearing shall comply with the following provisions:
         a.   The Director, or his or her designee, shall abide by any prior
determination that a debt exists and the scope of review shall be limited to
whether the debt has been satisfied and whether the determination that a debt
exists was issued against the respondent. The petitioner shall not be entitled
to raise any defenses related to his or her liability for the underlying debt.
         b.   The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the
conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it
is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct
of their affairs.
         c.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Director or his or her
designee shall issue a final order that the respondent is either eligible or
ineligible for issuance or renewal of the license/permit. If the respondent is
found to be ineligible, the petitioner's license/permit may not be issued or
renewed prior to the payment of the outstanding debt. The Director, or his or
her designee, shall issue a final order no more than fifteen (15) business days
after the conclusion of the hearing.
   H.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
29-1-17G of this section, the Village may issue an initial or renewal license
or permit to a respondent if the Director of the issuing Department or other
appropriate Village Department or agency determines that:
      1.   The respondent has entered into an agreement with a court of
competent jurisdiction, the Department of Finance, or other appropriate Village
Department or agency, for the payment of all debts owed and the respondent is
in compliance with the agreement; or
      2.   The respondent is contesting liability for or the amount of the debt
in a pending administrative or judicial proceeding; or
      3.   The respondent has filed a petition in bankruptcy and the debts owed
are dischargeable in bankruptcy;
      4.   The overriding interests of public safety and welfare require the
issuance of the permit or license.
   I.   When the holder of a license or permit is notified in accordance with
subsection
29-1-17G2 of this section that such license or permit will not be renewed
unless an outstanding judgment is paid, the license or permit shall remain in
effect during the pendency of any properly filed appeal as described in
subsection
29-1-17G of this section. When a license or permit is found to be ineligible
for renewal through the appeal process, it shall expire at such time as the
license or permit holder has exhausted or failed to exhaust the appeal
procedures described in subsection
29-1-17G of this section.
   J.   Nothing in this section shall prevent the Village from enforcing or
seeking to enforce any order of an Administrative Law Judge in any manner
provided by law. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-03)
29-1-18: ELECTION OF REMEDIES:
In no case may the Office of Adjudication conduct an adjudication hearing for
an alleged code violation where the remedy provided for is a punishment of
imprisonment. Nothing in this chapter, however, shall preclude the Village from
petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate an ordinance
violation or an ordinance violation which provides the remedy of imprisonment,
or from petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to impose the remedy of
imprisonment for failure to comply with an order of an Administrative Law
Judge. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-03)
29-1-19: ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES NOT EXCLUSIVE:
The adoption by the Village of a system of administrative adjudication does not
preclude the Village from using other lawful methods to enforce municipal
ordinances. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-03)
29-1-20: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted so as not to be in conflict
with the laws of the State or any other limitations imposed by law. In the
event, however, that any section, provision, sentence, or clause of this
chapter is declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, that
determination will not affect the other remaining provisions of this chapter.

postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the vehicle as
recorded with the Secretary of State of Illinois or, if the vehicle is
registered in a state other than Illinois, as recorded in such other state's
registry of motor vehicles. (Ord. 2003-0-42, 10-7-2003)
29-2-13: IMMOBILIZATION PROGRAM:
   A.   The Village Manager or his/her designee is hereby authorized to direct
and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of enforcing
the parking ordinances of the Traffic Code. The program of vehicle
immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle located on
the public way or any Village owned property by placement of a restraint in
such a manner as to prevent its operation. Only vehicles with State
registration numbers set forth on a vehicle immobilization eligibility list may
be immobilized.
   B.   When the registered owner of one or more vehicles has accumulated five
(5) or more final determinations of parking violation liability on any and all
vehicles registered to that owner, in any combination, for which the fines and
applicable penalties, if applicable, have not been paid in full, the Village
Manager and/or his/her designee shall cause a notice of impending vehicle
immobilization to be sent to the owner of such vehicle(s) in accordance with
section
29-2-12 of this article or placed on the owner's vehicle when the owner cannot
be reached by mail. The notice of impending vehicle immobilization shall state
the name and address of the registered owner, the State registration number of
the vehicle or vehicles registered to such owner, and a list detailing serial
numbers of the parking violation notices which have resulted in a final
determination of liability for which fines and/or penalties remain unpaid.
Except as provided in section
29-2-17 of this article, failure to pay the total amount of the fines and
penalties owed within twenty one (21) days from the date of the notice will
result in the inclusion of the State registration number of all vehicles of
such owner on a vehicle immobilization eligibility list; a person will not be
removed from the immobilization eligibility list unless all outstanding tickets
are paid in full. A person may challenge the validity of the notice of
impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in
person to submit evidence which would disprove liability within twenty one (21)
days of the date of the notice. All of the above information shall also appear
in the notice. Documentary evidence which disproves liability shall be based on
the following grounds:
      1.   That all fines and penalties for the violations cited in the notice
have been paid in full; or
      2.   That the registered owner has not accumulated five (5) or more final
determinations of parking violation liability which were unpaid at the time the
notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued.
   C.   Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed
to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the vehicle
is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its
damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage
to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of subsection
29-2-13H of this section. The notice shall also state the manner in which the
immobilization device may be released, and the manner in which the registered
owner may obtain an immobilization hearing. If the owner of the vehicle has not
caused the immobilization device to be released in accordance with the
procedures established in this article within twenty four (24) hours of its
placement, the Village may release the device and may tow and impound the
vehicle.
   D.   The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person may
secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization, towing and
storage fees provided in subsection
29-2-13G of this section, and all fines and penalties remaining due on each
final determination of liability issued to such person.
   E.   The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a hearing
to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing was erroneous,
if the owner files a written request with the Office of Adjudication for a
hearing with the Village Manager and/or his/her designee within fourteen (14)
days after immobilization or fourteen (14) days of the date of the notice sent
pursuant to subsection
29-2-13F of this section, whichever is later. Hearings requested pursuant to
this subsection shall be conducted by the Village Manager and/or his/her
designee upon receipt of a written request for a hearing. The determination
made by the Village Manager and/or his/her designee regarding the validity of
the immobilization shall become final.
   F.   Within ten (10) days after a vehicle has been impounded, a notice of
impoundment shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
address of the registered owner as listed with the Secretary of State. The
notice shall state that the owner has the right to request a postimmobilization
and posttow hearing as provided in subsection
29-2-13E of this section, and that if the vehicle is not claimed within thirty
(30) days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise
disposed of in accordance with sections 4-208(b) and 4-209 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code.
   G.   The fee for removal of immobilization device shall be one hundred fifty
three dollars ($153.00). Fees for towing and storage will be the current year's
Village contract price for said services.
   H.   It shall be unlawful for any person other than a Village employee or
authorized representative to remove or damage the immobilization device or to
relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilization device without the
prior approval of the Village Manager or his or her designee. Any person who
violates this section shall be subject to a penalty of seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each such violation. (Ord. 18-402, 9-17-2018, eff. 1-1-

violations on any and all vehicles registered to that owner, the Director of
Adjudication shall cause a notice of impending driver's license suspension to
be sent to the registered owner, in accordance with section
29-2-12 of this article. The notice shall state that failure to pay the amount
owing within forty five (45) days of the date of the notice will result in the
Village sending a certified report to the Secretary of State that the person
has unpaid fines and penalties as a result of ten (10) or more parking
violations and is eligible for driver's license suspension pursuant to section
6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.

Vehicle Code, that the person has unpaid fines and penalties as a result of ten
(10) or more parking violations and is eligible for driver's license suspension
pursuant to section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The Director of

notice sent by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 6-306.5(b) of the
Illinois Vehicle Code, file with the Director of Adjudication a written request
for a hearing to contest the certified report. The grounds for such a challenge
shall be limited to: 1) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the
vehicle or vehicles receiving ten (10) or more parking violation notices on the
date or dates such notices were issued; or 2) the person having already paid
the fine and penalty for the ten (10) or more violations indicated on the
notice or report. Hearings pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted by an
Administrative Law Judge appointed pursuant to this chapter.
   D.   If a person named in a certified report has paid the previously
reported fines and/or penalties or if the report is determined by the Director
of Adjudication to be in error, the Director of Adjudication shall notify the
Secretary of State in accordance with section 6-306.5(d) of the Illinois
Vehicle Code. A certified copy of such notification shall be given, upon

for failure to comply with the provisions of this section, conditions placed on
the face of the permit, applicable codes or ordinances of the Village, or State

to an emergency situation that threatens life, health or property such as
weather conditions. A permit holder shall cooperate with the Village to
dismantle and/or remove any equipment for the event and/or provide public
notice of the cancellation. A decision to cancel a permit by the Police Chief
and/or Fire Chief under this subsection shall not be subject to an appeal as
set forth in subsection
30-1-3F of this section. The revocation or cancellation of a permit by the
Village pursuant to this section or the cancellation of an event by a permit
holder shall not entitle the permit holder to a refund of the fifty percent
(50%) deposit made under subsection
30-1-3D5 of this section.
      2.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code, if in the judgment
of the Police Chief and/or Fire Chief, an emergency situation has been created
such that the continued use of public property by a sponsor will immediately
threaten life, health or property, the Police Chief and/or Fire Chief, or their
designees, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such
conclusion and without notice or hearing may immediately cancel the permit and
require the use of public property to immediately cease. No person shall
continue to use public property contrary to such order. A decision to cancel
the continued use of public property by the Police Chief and/or Fire Chief
under this subsection shall not be subject to an appeal as set forth in
subsection
30-1-3F of this section. A permit holder shall cooperate with the Village to
dismantle and/or remove any equipment for the event and/or provide public
notice of the cancellation. The cancellation of a permit pursuant to this
section shall not entitle the permit holder to a refund of the fifty percent
(50%) deposit made under subsection
30-1-3D5 of this section.
   F.   Appeal: The decision to deny or revoke a permit required by this
section shall be appealable by the sponsor to the Village Manager or his/her
designee. Such appeal shall be initiated by written notice to the Village
Manager before the close of the next regular Village business day after the
date of service of such denial or revocation, or such appeal shall be deemed
waived. The sponsor shall be given an opportunity to be heard by the Village
Manager or his/her designee upon any such denial or revocation within one
business day after receipt of any such notice of appeal. The Village Manager or

her designee shall be made before the close of the next Village regular
business day following the conclusion of any such hearing. The sponsor shall
receive written notice of the Village Manager's or his/her designee's decision,
which decision shall be a final decision for the purposes of administrative
review. A decision to overturn a revocation of a permit pursuant to this
section shall entitle the event sponsor to proceed with the event. If the
revocation of the permit is sustained, the event sponsor shall not be entitled
to a refund of the fifty percent (50%) deposit made under subsection
30-1-3I2 of this section.
