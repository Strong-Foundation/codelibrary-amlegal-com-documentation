transporter to pass the fee through to another party, and does not allow
voluntary cancellation or renegotiation of the compensation or fee during the
term of the contract; and
         (d)   The contract was lawfully executed on or before December 31,
1986 and has not been amended at any time after that date, or was lawfully
executed during 1987 or 1988 and has not been amended on or after January 1,
1989.
      (7)   Solid waste meet all of the following criteria:
         (a)   The waste is non-putrescible and homogenous and does not contain
free liquids;
         (b)   Combustion of the waste would not provide practical energy
recovery or practical reduction in volume; and
         (c)   The applicant for exemption demonstrates that it is not
technologically and economically reasonable to recycle or reuse the waste.
   (B)   Even though the waste (identified in division (A)(6) above) is exempt
from the fee imposed by the state pursuant to an exemption granted under 415
ILCS 5/, this surcharge shall apply to the permanent disposal of solid waste
under any contract lawfully executed before June 1, 1986 under which more than
150,000 cubic yards (or 50,000 tons) of solid waste is to be permanently
disposed of.
   (C)   Only those exemptions (identified in division (A) above) which have
been approved by the Agency shall be honored by the county. It shall be the
responsibility of the owners or operators of all solid waste disposal
facilities in the county to provide proof to the county of the Agency’s
approval of any claimed exemption. This proof is to be included with the
quarterly report and payment to the county as detailed in §
50.23.
(Ord. O-23-6-89, passed 6-13-1989; Res. G-5757-02-25, passed 2-13-2025)
§ 50.23 REPORTS AND PAYMENTS.
   (A)   All owners or operator of solid waste disposal facilities shall make
quarterly reports and payments, except those exempted in division (B) below.
These shall be due on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each
year and shall cover the preceding three months.
   (B)   Owners or operators of solid waste disposal facilities which are
permitted by the Agency to receive only demolition or construction debris or
landscape waste are exempt from the reports and payments required by this
section.
   (C)   The required quarterly report shall contain a summary of all wastes
received at the site during the three-month period for which the report is
submitted. This report shall specify the total amount of non-hazardous solid
waste permanently disposed of at the site, the amount that is subject to the
county’s surcharge, the amount that is exempt, and the basis for the exemption.
The report shall also contain computations showing the total surcharge to be
paid for the quarter.
   (D)   Computation of surcharge.
      (1)   As shown in §
50.21, this surcharge is based on categories which are determined by the total
number of cubic yards of non-hazardous solid waste permanently disposed of at
the site in a calendar year. If the amount of waste is measured using an Agency
certified scale, then the weight of the waste must be multiplied by 3.3 cubic
yards per ton in order to convert this to cubic yards. (This is the standard
conversion rate used by the Agency. If the Agency has approved a different
conversion rate for a disposal facility, this rate should be used and noted in
the report.) In the following computations, use either the cubic yards, or the
weight converted to cubic yards, whichever is appropriate, in determining which
surcharge rate category is applicable.
      (2)   For payments made for the first three quarters of the calendar year
(due April 15, July 15, and October 15):
         (a)   Multiply the total cubic yards of non-exempt solid waste for the
quarter by four to estimate the user’s yearly cubic yards. Use this estimated
yearly figure to find the user’s surcharge rate category in §
50.21;
         (b)   If the user fall into category “A”, then multiply the amount of
non-exempt solid waste for the quarter, measured either in cubic yards or tons,
by the appropriate rate to calculate the required payment for the quarter; and
         (c)   If the user falls into categories “B” through “E”, then simply
divide the appropriate annual surcharge by four to calculate the required
payment for the quarter.
   (E)   Payment of the surcharge shall be made on a quarterly basis in
conjunction with the required reports, as described above. The payment shall be
in the form of a check or money order payable to the “Treasurer, County of
Macon.”
   (F)   The required reports and payments shall be delivered to the office of
the County Board Chairperson, at the following address: Room 501, Macon County
Building, 141 S. Main Street, Decatur, IL 62523.
(Ord. O-23-6-89, passed 6-13-1989; Res. G-5757-02-25, passed 2-13-2025)
§ 50.24 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT FUND.
   (A)   Payments collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be deposited in a
separate fund, designated as the Solid Waste Management Fund, and shall be
expended only for solid waste management purposes, including long-term
monitoring and maintenance of landfills, planning, implementation, inspection,
enforcement, and other activities consistent with the Solid Waste Management
Act, being 415 ILCS 20/1 et seq., and the Local Solid Waste Disposal Act, being
415 ILCS 10/1 et seq.
   (B)   The Agency shall conduct an annual audit of the expenditures made from
this Fund to ensure that the expenditures have been made for the prescribed
purposes.

§ 50.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   The violation of any provision of this chapter is a misdemeanor (petty
offense according to 55 ILCS 5/5-8006, chapter 34, par. 5-8006) and may be
punishable by a suspension of any license (length of suspension to be
determined) held under the provisions herein or by a fine of not less than
$150, nor more than $500 for each offense. Offenses that continue beyond a
single day shall be considered separate offenses for each day the offense
continues. The penalties or remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and
resolution of any one or more shall be no defense to prosecution of another.
   (B)   In addition to any other penalty or action provided for or authorized
by this chapter, the county may institute any action or proceeding to prevent
any violation hereof, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to
prevent the operation of any refuse disposal facility and/or vehicle in
violation of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.01 HOST COUNTY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   In addition to the federal, state, and local requirements for siting
and permitting pollution control facilities, it shall be the policy of the
county to require an applicant proposing the expansion of an existing pollution
control facility or the siting of a new pollution control facility located in
an unincorporated area of the county to enter into a host agreement with the
county prior to filing a siting application pursuant to § 39.2 of the State
Environmental Protection Act.
   (B)   The host county agreement may include but not be limited to the
following provisions:
      (1)   No regulated hazardous waste shall be accepted for final disposal
at the pollution control facility;
      (2)   A guarantee of extended disposal capacity for the county’s non-
hazardous solid waste and non-hazardous special waste (contingent upon the
pollution control facility having proper permits from the EPA). The duration of
the capacity guarantee will be agreed upon by the pollution control facility
applicant and the county;
      (3)   A property value protection program for existing homes within a
site specific distance;
      (4)   A domestic water well protection plan for existing water wells
within a site specific distance;
      (5)   An indemnification agreement that will indemnify and hold harmless
the county and its officers, agents, employees, and other appropriate parties
from liability associated with any and all operations at the pollution control
facility;
      (6)   Payment of a host fee to the county, which shall be calculated as a
percentage of revenues or on a per ton basis. If the fee is calculated on a per
ton basis, the per ton host fee will be adjusted annually based on the
appropriate Consumer Price Index for the county. The host fee may be in
addition to the local solid waste management surcharge as allowed under § 22.1;
      (7)   An assignment of rights clause that will allow the County Board
authority to approve or disapprove any transfer of ownership or other interest
in the pollution control facility;
      (8)   If the pollution control facility is not publicly owned, an
environmental contingency fund or an alternative environmental protection plan
must be established. The environmental contingency fund or environmental
protection plan is in addition to the financial assurance requirements of the
state and federal regulations;
      (9)   A procedure for enforcing the terms of the host county agreement;
and
      (10)   Other provisions to be negotiated.

ability of the county to conduct a complete and impartial public hearing. The
applicant will be responsible for any cost above the reduced fee.
      (4)   Each modification to an application that has been submitted but not
yet approved shall require additional funds to be deposited with the County
Treasurer such that the funds in retainer are always greater than $50,000. The
additional funds shall be applied against the reasonable and necessary costs as
set forth herein above.
   (C)   No pollution control facility site application shall be accepted until
the appropriate filing fee is paid and accompanied by a notarized statement of
the appropriate corporate officials, or official legal representative of the
applicant, that the applicant will pay to the county additional fees to
reimburse the county monies expended in excess of the filing fee in preparing
for, processing, reviewing, and evaluating the application to its final
resolution.
   (D)   The fees collected hereunder shall be used only to defray the costs
incurred by the county in connection with applications for site approval filed
under the provisions of 415 ILCS 5/39.2. Any remainder after the final
resolution of the application will be refunded to the applicant.

that a homeowner may install and/or service a private sewage disposal system
which serves his or her own personal single-family residence.
   (B)   All private sewage disposal systems shall have a soil investigation.
Soil investigations shall be the sole method for determining the absorption
capacity of the soil. Percolation test results will no longer be accepted. Soil
investigations shall be conducted in the following manner.
      (1)   Determination of soil characteristics on site proposed for
development with private sewage disposal systems shall be based on soil boring
data collected by a soil classifier or an Illinois licensed professional
engineer.
      (2)   There shall be a minimum of three borings per soil absorption
system site. The soil borings shall be at least 50 feet, and the proposed
subsurface seepage system shall be located within the area where the soil
borings were located. More soil borings may be necessary for accurate and
appropriate evaluation of a site where there is some concern about the
consistency of the soil materials. One of the borings shall be made at the
lowest elevation of the proposed absorption field area. Borings shall extend a
minimum of 60 inches below the natural ground surface. An observation pit shall
be used in gravelly materials.
      (3)   Observation and determination of soil characteristics also may be
determined from a pit dug by a backhoe or other excavating equipment. The
County Health Department may require soil pits (backhoe excavation) in cases
where there has been previous or current fill material, cutting of soils, or
where gravelly soils were encountered. Such soil pits shall be prepared at the
perimeter of the expected soil absorption area to minimize damage to natural
soil structure. Soil pits shall extend a minimum of 60 inches below the natural
ground surface.
      (4)   Site characteristics to be described include zones of seasonal and
permanent water saturation, U.S.D.A. soil textural changes, U.S.D.A. soil
structural features, slope, compaction and depth, soil coloration, depth of
limiting layer, depth of soil mottling (depth to low chroma equal to or less
than 2 and a value of 4 or more- Munsell Color System), internal drainage
classification, permeability range, and other limiting soil characteristics
that may reduce permeability.
      (5)   Soil investigations shall be performed within three years prior to
permit application. In the event that the area undergoing soil analysis is
altered after the soil investigation is performed, the County Health Department
may require an additional soil investigation to ensure that the results have
not been affected.
   (C)   All septage disposal sites within the county shall be inspected by the
Health Department to determine compliance with the provisions of this
subchapter. If the disposal sites are determined to be unacceptable, the Health
Department shall issue written notice to the users and owners of that site
informing them that the site shall not be used for disposal of septage.
   (D)   A private sewage disposal system pumping contractor or homeowner
servicing his or her personal residence system shall supply a list of all
septage disposal sites utilized by either the contractor or homeowner to the
County Health Department.
   (E)   The private sewage disposal system installation contractor, the
private sewage system pumping contractor, and the homeowner who constructs,
installs, repairs, modifies, or maintains private sewage disposal systems, or
cleans or pumps waste from private sewage disposal systems shall perform work
in accordance with the standards promulgated under authority granted in the
Illinois Private Sewage Disposal Licensing Act and Code, as from time to time

in Macon County. A minimum of one soil boring will be required for each of the
proposed lots in the subdivision. A copy of the soil investigations report must
be submitted to the County Health Department for review and approval before
approval of the final subdivision plat.
   (B)   The developer/engineer of any proposed subdivision shall provide a
written private sewage disposal plan (that will become part of the subdivision
construction plat) that describes how the integrity of the reserve areas for
primary and secondary subsurface seepage systems are to be protected during the
property development. The plan shall specify how the original native soils
intended for private sewage disposal are to be protected from the following
activities: vehicular compaction, site grading, site excavation, soil staging,
site leveling, filling, and coring. The plan shall also state that the reserved
areas will be marked or flagged off in order to prevent the above activities
from disturbing the original native soil conditions.

PERMITS
§ 91.20 GENERAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a food establishment
within the jurisdiction of Macon County who does not possess a valid permit
issued to that person. Only a person who complies with the requirement of this
chapter shall be entitled to receive and retain such a permit.
   (B)   Permits shall not be transferrable from person to person; permits
shall not be applicable to any location, building, or place other than that for
which the permit was originally issued. Changes may occur after a food
establishment is permitted. Changes that invalidate a permit include change of
ownership of the permit holder, a change in the physical location of the
establishment, a change in the type of operation, a change in menu that
requires the addition of equipment and/or structural modifications of the food
establishment, a change in menu that requires a food preparation process that
was not contemplated when the permit was issued, or a change in menu where
animal meat is to be served raw or undercooked.
   (C)   The Health Authority must be notified within 30 days of any change of
information on the permit application, or the permit holder will be subject to
prosecution pursuant to §
91.83. Additionally, a permit may be subject to suspension or revocation
pursuant to §§
91.25 or
91.26.
   (D)   The Health Authority shall solely determine if a change invalidates a
valid permit.
(Ord. O-132-11-18, passed 11-8-2018; Ord. O-156-10-24, passed 10-10-2024)
§ 91.21 PERMIT CATEGORIES.
   (A)   The Health Authority shall assess the risks of a foodborne illness for
every food establishment operating within Macon County. The Health Authority
shall use this assessment in classifying a food establishment for purposes of a
category. The Health Authority shall apply the criteria in the Food Code to
determine the category for a food establishment. If a health hazard will not
result from reclassification or if reclassification will provide better
protection for the public, the Health Authority may reclassify a food
establishment based on inspection history; the number, frequency, and severity
of violations; and corrective action. The basis for this decision shall be
documented, and a copy will be retained in the food establishment’s file.
      (1)   CATEGORY 1 FOOD ESTABLISHMENT means a food establishment that
presents a high relative risk of causing a foodborne illness based upon the
large number of food handling operations typically implicated in foodborne
outbreaks and/or the type of population served by the facility. CFPM credential
is required for this designation.
      (2)   CATEGORY 2 FOOD ESTABLISHMENT means a food establishment that
presents a moderate relative risk of causing foodborne illness based upon few
handling operations typically implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks. CFPM
credential is required for this designation.
      (3)   CATEGORY 3 FOOD ESTABLISHMENT means a food establishment that
presents a low relative risk of causing a foodborne illness based upon few or
no food handling operations typically implicated in foodborne illness
outbreaks.
   (B)   These license categories are not meant to imply that any given
establishment is more or less safe than others. The criteria in the Food Code
shall be utilized to determine risk.
(Ord. O-132-11-18, passed 11-8-2018; Ord. O-156-10-24, passed 10-10-2024)
§ 91.22 PERMIT POSTING AND ISSUANCE.
   (A)   Posting. Every licensed food establishment shall prominently and
conspicuously post a valid permit for public view.
   (B)   Issuance. Any person desiring to operate a food establishment or to
renew an expired permit Macon County shall make a written application for a
permit on forms provided by the Macon County Health Department, accompanied by
a permit fee, if required, in an amount set forth by the Macon County Board of
Health.
      (1)   When plans are required. A permit applicant or permit holder shall
submit to the Health Authority properly prepared plans and specifications for
review and approval before any of the following can occur:
         (a)   The construction of a food establishment;
         (b)   The conversion of an existing structure for use as a food
establishment;
         (c)   The remodel of a food establishment; or
         (d)   A change of type of food establishment or food operation if the
Health Authority determines that plans and specifications are necessary to
ensure compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   Application for permit. After approval of the plans proposed for
the permit by a food establishment, the Health Authority shall conduct an
inspection of the premises. If the Health Authority finds that the food
establishment is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and upon
receipt of a completed application, and associated fee, the Health Authority
shall issue a permit authorizing the food establishment to operate.
      (3)   Annual renewal of permits. For continued operation of the food
establishment, annual renewal of the permit is required. Any permit holder
desiring to renew a permit shall apply on the renewal forms provided by the
Macon County Health Department and pay all money due. A renewal permit is not
renewable if the permit holder has failed to remit outstanding fines owed to
the Macon County Health Department, or has failed to correct repeat priority,
priority foundation, and core violations ordered by the Macon County Health
Department, a local agency, or by a court.
         (a)   Any permit holder who has not paid their annual fee for their
annual renewal of permit by January 1 of the renewal year shall be considered
operating a food service establishment without a valid permit. A late penalty
fee of $50 shall be assessed for permit renewal payments received after January
1 of the permit renewal year. The late penalty shall be increased to $100 for
payments received after January 15 of the permit renewal year. Any food service
establishment operating on or after February 1 of the renewal year without a
renewed, valid permit shall discontinue operation or be subject to prosecution
pursuant to § 91.83. The late fee penalty beginning February 1 shall be
increased to $200.
         (b)   All permits shall be automatically suspended should the permit
holder cease operation of the food establishment for 30 consecutive days or
longer if the Health Authority is not given written notice prior to the
cessation of operation.
      (4)   Mobile food units are permits issued annually to food units that
meet the criteria set forth in the Macon County unit ordinance,
Chapter 116 of this code.
      (5)   Denial of application of permits. If an application for a permit to
operate is denied, the Health Authority shall provide the application with a
written notice that includes:
         (a)   The specific reasons and code citations for the permit denial;
and
         (b)   The actions, if any, that the applicant must take to qualify for
a permit.
      (6)   Change of ownership. If a person is purchasing an existing food
establishment, a change in ownership plan review is required prior to issuing a
new permit. For any determination of what constitutes a change in permit
holder, please contact the Health Authority. To assist in the transition of
business, the Health Authority will allow an open and operating food
establishment to change ownership without interruption of business provided
that the following conditions are met:
         (a)   A plan review for the new permit holder is submitted within 30
days of the execution of the change of owner documents;
         (b)   The food establishment stays within the same category as the
previous permit;
         (c)   The food establishment has not been physically altered,
equipment has not been removed or added, and the food establishment has not
been closed for extensive remodeling or for other reasons;
         (d)   The food establishment has not changed the menu in a manner that
requires new food preparation processes, procedures, and/or equipment; or
         (e)   The time to correct all violations cited in a change of
ownership inspection does not exceed 90 days from date of that change of
ownership inspection.
   (C)   If the provisions above are not met, then the food establishment shall
close, and the new owner will be required to apply for a new permit, including
completing the plan review process before the food establishment may reopen.

Authority before beginning or resuming operations to determine compliance with
approved plans, specifications, corrective actions, and the requirements of
this chapter.

§ 91.25 PERMIT SUSPENSION.
   (A)   If at any time the Health Authority determines that a permit holder or
operator is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the Health
Authority shall issue a notice to the permit holder or operator. The notice
shall state the nature of the violation and a reasonable timeframe in which
corrective action must be taken. Whenever a permit holder has failed to comply
with any notice issued under the provisions of this chapter, the Health
Authority may serve the permit holder or operator with a notice stating that
the permit is suspended, and operations are to cease immediately or as
otherwise ordered by the Health Authority. Notwithstanding the other provisions
of this chapter, whenever the Health Authority finds unsanitary or other
conditions in the operation of a food establishment, or a temporary food
establishment, which in the Health Authority’s judgment, constitutes a
substantial hazard to public health, it may, without warning, notice, or
hearing, issue a written notice to the permit holder or operator citing such
condition, specifying the corrective action to be taken, and stating that the
permit is immediately suspended. Any person to whom such an order is issued
shall comply immediately therewith, but upon written petition to the Health
Authority, shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.
      (1)   Hearings provided for in this section shall be conducted by the
Health Authority at a time and place designated by the Health Authority. Based
upon the record of such hearings, the Health Authority shall make findings and

permit holder by the Health Authority.
      (2)   All decisions of the Health Authority enforcing this chapter may be
appealed to the Macon County Board of Health in the manner set forth by this
section. Review of the final administrative decision of the Macon County Board
of Health may be had in the Circuit Court of Macon County, Illinois, pursuant
to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.).
   (B)   A permit holder whose permit has been suspended may at any time during
the suspension of the permit make a signed, written request for an inspection
for the purpose of the reinstatement of the permit, stating how the conditions
leading up to the suspension were corrected. Within 24 hours following receipt
of the written request, the Health Authority shall inspect the premises, and
shall reinstate the permit if the permit holder is in compliance with this
chapter. A fee set forth by the Macon County Board of Health for permit
reinstatement shall be applied to all food service establishments required to
cease food service operations. The reinstatement fee shall be paid in full to
the Health Authority prior to resuming operations. Two suspensions during a
period of 12 consecutive months shall constitute grounds for revocation of a
permit.
   (C)   Notice of closure stating the name of establishment, person in charge,
and date/time of permit suspension will be affixed to all points of entry into
facility. Closure sign must be visible and prominently displayed until removed
by the Health Authority and not removed under penalty of law.

establishment shall be determined, and it shall be placed into one of the
following categories:
      (1)   No follow-up required. No uncorrected priority or priority
foundation violations exist. Core violations may exist, but the quantity does
not warrant enforcement review. A limited number of repeat violations may have
been observed during the inspection.
      (2)   Follow-up required. A follow-up visit shall be completed at a date
noted on the report to verify the timely correction of the outstanding priority
or priority foundation violations.

nor be applicable at any location, building, or place other than that for which
it was issued.
   (F)   If a variance has been denied by the Health Authority, an appeal can
be made requesting a hearing before the Macon County Board of Health. The
hearing process is described in § 91.25.

   (A)   The Emergency Telephone System Board (ETSB) shall be responsible in
the unincorporated area of the county and, upon agreement with any municipality
that may request the service, for:
      (1)   Assigning new house numbers and/or correcting house numbers that do
not correspond to the countywide addressing system;
      (2)   The naming and/or renaming of all streets; and
      (3)   The provision of street name signs at street intersections, except
as cited in the county subdivision ordinance, §
154.072.
   (B)   Pre-existing street names and house numbers that do not strictly
conform with the provisions of this chapter may be retained if, in the judgment
of the ETSB, the nonconformance is minor in nature or is of great historical
significance to the county and/or its residents, and if the nonconformance does
not pose a threat to the public health and safety by causing undue difficulties
or delays for 9-1-1 system operations or emergency response.
   (C)   The ETSB shall cause to be created, and shall maintain, an accurate
map of all officially named streets within the county, shall establish address
ranges for each segment of each street, and shall record the location of each
address assigned along each street. The map(s) shall be the official repository
of the street names, address ranges, and address number assignments.
(Ord. O-78-11-09, passed 11-12-2009)
§ 92.03 STREET NAMING POLICY.
   (A)   Streets requiring names. A street will be named if it meets at least
one of the following conditions:
      (1)   If three or more principal structures exist, or are approved to be
constructed, that are accessed off a private street that is served by the
public right-of-way; or
      (2)   If the street is maintained by the county, township, or other unit
of local, state, or federal government.
   (B)   Street name selection.  The following standards will be used:
      (1)   A street name shall be appropriate and easy to read and pronounce
(so that children can use the name in an emergency situation);
      (2)   Names with the same theme (i.e., flowers, states) are suggested for
naming streets in an entire subdivision, as a means of general identification;
      (3)   Historically used or significant street names will be retained
where possible;
      (4)   Street names should be unique throughout the unincorporated area of
the county;
      (5)   Names having the same or similar pronunciation but with different
spellings shall not be used (e.g., Smith, Smyth, or Smythe; Allen or Alan);
      (6)   Avoid sound-alike names (e.g., Bay View Drive and Bayview Drive or
Brainard Lane and Barnard Lane);
      (7)   Names which may be offensive (slang, double meanings, and the like)
are prohibited;
      (8)   Use of special characters in street names, such as hyphens,
apostrophes, or dashes, is prohibited (e.g., Bob-O-Link; Jane’s Lane);
      (9)   Differentiation of the same street name by a suffix is not allowed
in the unincorporated area of the county (e.g., Moundview Lane and Moundview
Court);
      (10)   Usage of street names that have a partial name in common in the
same geographic area is prohibited (e.g., Lake Crest Drive and Lake Bottom
Drive);
      (11)   Use of standard suffixes or directional suffixes or prefixes as
street names is prohibited (e.g., North Avenue, Court Street, Avenue of Pines);
      (12)   Numbers are not allowed as street names (e.g., 1st Street; Third
Street), except that streets officially named with numbers by previous
governmental action may retain those numbered names;
      (13)   A street running continuously in one direction shall have only one
street name throughout its entire length;
      (14)   County highways shall be assigned street names for addressing
purposes, but shall also be identified on official maps by their route number
as an alias (i.e., C.H. 30); such alias shall not be used as part of an
address. In the unincorporated area of this county, state and federal highways
shall be named as, by way of example, “N. Route 121”, “S. Route 51”, or “E. I
72”; such street names shall be used as part of an address. State Route 105
running east from Decatur to the county line is an exception, as it is named E.
William Street for addressing purposes; and
      (15)   The ETSB shall review preliminary plats to ensure that proposed
new street names are consistent with this chapter. Street names and
designations on new plats must be approved by the ETSB before final plat
approval by the county. Duplication or use of “sound-alike” subdivision and/or
building complex names shall be avoided. Review by the ETSB shall be
accomplished in a timely manner.
   (C)   Directional prefixes. Where a street crosses an imaginary dividing
line extending north, south, east, and west from the intersection of North/
South Main Street and East/West Main Street in the center of the City of
Decatur, a prefix directional of North (“N”), South (“S”), East (“E”), or West
(“W”), as appropriate, shall be used with the street name. If a street does not
cross a dividing line, its name may have a prefix directional.
   (D)   Suffixes. Street name suffixes shall meet valid street suffix
abbreviations as defined by the United States Postal Service (USPS) official
suffix guidelines (USPS, Postal Addressing Standards, April 2012, Publication
28) and by the National Emergency Number Association (NENA).
(Ord. O-78-11-09, passed 11-12-2009)
§ 92.04 STREET NAME CHANGES.
   The following regulations are established for changing the name of a public
or private street that has been legally named and recorded.
   (A)   A request to change the name of an existing recorded street will
require the approval of 100% of the property owners along the street. Proposed
street names and signatures of property owners shall be provided to the ETSB in
the form of a petition. In the event that 100% approval is not obtained, the
street will not be renamed.
   (B)   The ETSB may deny the requested street name change if the ETSB finds
there are public health and safety concerns regarding the change.
   (C)   Approval by the ETSB for any street name change petition for any
reasons other than public health and safety will be contingent upon payment to
the ETSB by the petitioner of an administrative fee of $250, plus $5 for each
address along the street.

§ 92.05 PRIVATE STREET NAMES.
   The naming of a private street shall be required under the following
conditions.
   (A)   Private lanes with three or more principal structures and/or platted
lots along them shall be named and these principal structures and/or platted
lots shall be addressed off that private lane in accordance with the countywide
addressing system.
   (B)   A private street that serves only one or two principal structure(s)
and/or platted lot(s) is considered to be a driveway for the purposes of this
chapter. No street name shall be assigned nor any street sign erected by the
county. An unofficial name of any private driveway shall not be recognized by
the county and shall not be used as part of an address. Address(es) of the
principal structure(s) and/or platted lot(s) on the private driveway shall
consist of the name of the street from which the driveway departs and the
appropriate structure number(s) as determined by the countywide addressing
system described in this chapter. When the driveway serves a second principal
structure or platted lot, the next odd or even number, as appropriate, shall be
assigned to the second structure or lot. If additional principal structures are
built and/or additional lots are platted along a private driveway, resulting in
three or more principal structures and/or platted lots, the ETSB shall assign a
name to the driveway, all principal structures and/or platted lots shall be
assigned or reassigned an address number off that named private driveway, and a
street sign shall be erected in accordance with this chapter at the
intersection of the private driveway with the public street.
   (C)   When the ETSB requires the naming of a previously unnamed private
street, residents who are property owners on the subject street may, within 30
days of notification by the ETSB that the naming is required, provide to the
ETSB a petition bearing the approving signatures of at least 60% of the
property owners and containing up to three street name choices that are
acceptable to the petitioners. The street names, including spaces between
words, shall not be more than 18 spaces in length, prefix and suffix excluded.
The names shall not include numerical reference or numerical, alphabetic, or
alphanumeric sequences. If at least 60% of the property owners do not agree
with a suggested name, or the ETSB does not approve any of the suggested names,
the ETSB shall have the authority to assign a name to the private street.
(Ord. O-78-11-09, passed 11-12-2009)
§ 92.06 STREET SIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   A street name sign of standard design, as recommended by the ETSB and
approved by the County Engineer, shall be erected on a standard pole at each
intersection of public streets and at the intersections of public streets and
officially named private streets within the unincorporated area of this county.
At least one street name sign post displaying the name of each street shall be
erected and maintained at each intersection in the corner most suitable as
determined by the County Engineer.
   (B)   (1)   Street name signs shall be erected and maintained by the County
Highway Department. The cost of materials and any specialized equipment for the

      (2)   Street name signs for public streets shall have white reflective
numbers and lettering on a green reflective background. Street name signs for
private streets named under this chapter shall have white reflective numbers

responsible for initial installation of new street name poles and signs as
cited in the county subdivision ordinance, §
154.072.
      (4)   A developer may not install decorative street name poles and signs
for new subdivision streets.
      (5)   Unofficial private street name signs shall not be erected on any
public rights-of-way, nor shall the unofficial street name signs have the same
design and/or color background as county-maintained street name signs, nor
shall the signs be posted in such a manner as to cause confusion for emergency
responders or for the public, as judged by the County Engineer and the ETSB.
The signs shall be in violation of this chapter.
      (6)   No person shall remove or deface any street sign or pole that is
erected or maintained by the County Highway Department.

§ 92.07 HOUSE NUMBERS, GENERALLY.
   (A)   All principal structures and significant landmarks in the
unincorporated area of the county are required to have an address approved or
issued by the ETSB. Assignment of separate addresses to nearby accessory
buildings shall be avoided except where the buildings have separate landline
telephone service and/or separately metered utility service or are used for
residential, commercial, or business purposes. An accessory building may also
be addressed when the building is not visible or accessible by emergency
services from the principal structure.
   (B)   Upon application to the ETSB by a land owner or his or her authorized
agent, or by action initiated by the ETSB, a house number shall be assigned for
new construction, or for any pre-existing principal structure that lacks an
address, that is consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Existing house
numbers that do not comply with the countywide addressing system may be
corrected by the ETSB at the request of the property owner or his or her
authorized agent, or the correction may be initiated by the ETSB. When a change
of address for a pre-existing principal structure is initiated by the ETSB, the
property owner shall be notified in writing 30 days prior to the time the new
number shall become the official number for the property in question. Within 60
days after receipt of an official notification letter of a change of address or
new address assignment by the ETSB, the owner or occupant shall, at his or her
own expense, affix/display the assigned address number(s) in accordance with
this chapter.
   (C)   No person, firm, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity shall
authorize any public utility company as defined by state law to supply any
public utility services to any new residence or business or other structure in
the unincorporated area of the county until an address for the new residence or
business or other structure has been assigned or otherwise approved by the
ETSB.
(Ord. O-58-3-9-06, passed 3-9-2006)
§ 92.08 HOUSE NUMBERS, GUIDELINES.
   The following guidelines shall apply to pre-existing, changed, and new
addresses.
   (A)   Number assignment.  Assignment of address numbers shall be based upon

by this chapter.
   (B)   Conflicting numbers. The owner or occupant shall remove any pre-
existing or different address numbers that might be mistaken for or confused
with the proper number that has been assigned by the ETSB to the structure.
   (C)   Dimensions. Address numbers shall be a minimum of three inches in
height, shall be affixed near or on the main entrance to the structure, and
shall be visible from the street named in the address. All house numbers shall
be in Arabic numerals (i.e., block print). Address numbers shall contrast with
the surrounding surface so as to be readily identifiable and may be arranged
horizontally or vertically.
   (D)   Restrictions on numbers. Numbers evenly divisible by 100 shall not be
used in assigning house numbers. Fractions shall not be used in assigning house
numbers. A new address shall be assigned by the ETSB to correct any pre-
existing address that uses a fraction. There shall be no use of fractional
addresses, alphanumeric address numbers, nor hyphenated address numbers (i.e.,
134-1/2 Ash Street, 123A Main Street, or 41-656 Bell Street).
   (E)   Mailboxes. When the structure is more than 50 feet from the street
named in an address, or when the entrance of the building is not visible from
the street, the address number shall also be mounted on a post, sign, wall,
fence, or mailbox that is on the same side of the street as the addressed
structure, within ten feet of the driveway, and not more than 20 feet back from
the street, and shall be readily visible from the street when approaching from
either direction. (Mailboxes that are grouped, that are on the opposite side of
the street from the structure, or that are located away from the driveway that
serves the structure shall not be used for displaying house numbers as defined
in these rules, because the mailboxes may not allow house numbers to be viewed
from either direction and/or may not provide adequate identification of the
location of the addressed structure. The mailboxes should be labeled according
to United States Postal Service guidelines for proper mail delivery.)
   (F)   Multiple-use situations. Any site which includes multiple apartments,
suites, spaces, or other units must include the appropriate unit designator and
number in the address following the street name. Appropriate designators shall
be APT/Apartment, BLDG/Building, CBN/Cabin, DEPT/Department, STE/Suite, SP/
Space, FL/Floor, TRLR/Trailer, HNGR/Hanger, UNIT/Unit, LOT/Lot. Basement unit
numbers shall be three-digit numbers beginning with “0” (APT 005), first-floor

arranged and rented as apartments. The apartment house shall be given one
street number and each individual apartment shall be given an apartment number.
Example: “250 W. Elwin Road APT 103”.
      (2)   Residential condominium complex. A building or buildings with
individual, separately owned units in a multi-unit structure. The private

structure shall be given its own street number. Units in the same structure
shall have a unit number.
      (3)   Commercial complex. A building or buildings under one ownership,
used for commerce or industrial use. If each unit within a building has its
entrance off a common interior hallway, then each building shall be given its
own street number and each unit within the building shall be given its own unit
or suite number. The building number shall be displayed on or near the main
building entrance and each unit or suite number shall be displayed at each
unit’s entrance. If each unit within a building has its own street entrance,
not off a common interior hallway, then each unit shall be given its own street
number. Each unit street number shall be displayed on or near that unit’s main
entrance.
      (4)   Commercial complex with apartment complex.  A building or buildings
used for commercial use in which there are also apartments. Each building shall
be given its own street number, each commercial unit shall be given a
respective unit or suite number, and each apartment shall be given a respective
apartment number. At no time shall there be unit or apartment numbers within a
complex that are the same.
      (5)   Duplex; a two-family residential structure.  Each family unit shall
be given its own street number. If multiple duplex buildings are served by a
private street, that street may be given a name and the duplex units addressed
off that street.

occupancies with multiple addresses, the posting of the range of addresses on
the main plaza or occupancy sign, readily viewed from the street, is
encouraged.
   (G)   Pre-addressed recorded subdivision plats. As a general rule,
subdivision plats of record may be pre-addressed by the ETSB in accordance with
these rules. Addresses identified on recorded surveys which are not approved by
the ETSB and recorded in the addressing database are not valid and shall not be
used for physical addressing purposes.
   (H)   Corner lots.  When assigning a number to a principal structure that
does not prominently front on a street and is located on a corner lot, a number
from the street with which the main driveway intersects shall be assigned. Any
principal structure on a corner lot that prominently fronts on a street may be
assigned a number upon that street regardless of the driveway location. Dual
addresses shall be avoided.
   (I)   House numbers along diagonal, meandering, or curvilinear streets.
Where the street does not run directly north-south or east-west, the general
course of the street is to be used in determining the house numbering
direction.
   (J)   Suffix letters and numerals. Planned suffix letters and/or numbers for
multiple-occupancy dwellings, mobile home park spaces, office suites, and other
buildings or developments that are divided into address units shall be
submitted to the ETSB for approval prior to being adopted by the property owner

presenting proof of rabies vaccination. Registration tags must be of suitable,
durable material and of a size suitable to be affixed to a collar worn by the

shall use this assessment in classifying a mobile food unit for purposes of a
category.
   (B)   The Health Authority shall apply the criteria in the Illinois Food
Service Sanitation Code to determine the category for a mobile food unit. If a
health hazard will not result from reclassification or if reclassification will
provide better protection for the public, the Health Authority may reclassify a

severity of violations; and corrective action. The basis few this decision
shall be documented, and a copy will be retained in the food establishment’s
file.
      (1)   CATEGORY 1.
         (a)   A mobile food unit that presents a high relative risk of causing
a foodborne illness based upon the large number of food handling operations
typically implicated in foodborne outbreaks and/or the type of population
served by the facility. CFPM credential is required for this designation.
         (b)   These mobile food units must have a commissary on file
demonstrating means of cooling and reheating.
      (2)   CATEGORY 2. A mobile food unit that presents a moderate relative
risk of causing foodborne illness based upon few handling operations typically
implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks. CFPM credential is required for this
designation.
      (3)   CATEGORY 3. A mobile food unit that presents a low relative risk of
causing a foodborne illness based upon few or no food handling operations

establishment is more or less safe than others. The criteria in the Illinois
Food Service Sanitation Code shall be utilized to determine risk.

§ 151.11 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to Macon County Zoning Board of
Appeals for a variance. The Macon County Zoning Board of Appeals shall review
the applicants request for a variance and shall submit its recommendations to
the Macon County Board. The Macon County Board may attach such conditions to
granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this
chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other

      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP.
   (B)   The Macon County Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in
writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protections
standards of §
151.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic structures. Variances to the building protection requirements
of §
151.07 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in §
151.02, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§§
151.06 and
151.07 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture. 
      (1)   Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided
individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as
those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and
the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
         (a)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement facilities
cannot be considered agricultural structures.
         (b)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
         (c)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures,
the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation,
wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base
flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance
with §
151.07 of this chapter.
         (d)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
         (e)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be

resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with §
151.07 of this chapter.
   (E)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with §
151.07(B) this chapter.
   (F)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain management
floodway provisions of §
151.06 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
   (G)   Wet-floodproofmg construction techniques must be reviewed and approved
by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer or
architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.
(Ord. O-125-03-17, passed 3-9-2017)
§ 151.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
Macon County or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. O-125-03-17, passed 3-9-2017)
§ 151.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Macon
County Board to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program including: June 16, 2011. However, this chapter does not repeal the
original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program.
Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance
easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. O-125-03-17, passed 3-9-2017)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Macon County Planning
and Zoning Department may determine that a violation of the minimum standards
of this chapter exists. The Macon County Planning and Zoning Department shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   Macon County shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this section or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   Macon County shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (B)   The Macon County Planning and Zoning Department shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages
and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
   (C)   (1)   The Macon County Planning and Zoning Department is authorized to
issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop-
work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall
order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the
stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (2)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Macon County Zoning Board of Appeals.
Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall
state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (3)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Macon
County Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be
suspended or revoked.
   (D)   Nothing herein shall prevent Macon County from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 154.035 REPLAT.
   (A)   The replat procedures shall apply when an alteration, redesign, or
resubdivision is proposed for an existing legally recorded subdivision or part
thereof. The replat may be processed in one or two steps depending upon whether
or not it is necessary to vacate or alter any streets, easements, lots, or
other public facilities. In the instance where no public facilities, easements,
lot records, or other improvements are involved and where the plan change
corresponds with the provisions of the County Comprehensive Plan, the further
subdivision or other alteration of lots in existing subdivision shall follow
the same procedures as described under a minor subdivision; in all other
instances involving subdivision classified as replats, the original plat must
be vacated according to the following division (B).
   (B)   (1)   Vacation of existing plat. Any person, firm, or agent thereof
wishing to have vacated existing lot lines, public streets, highways, or alleys
or any easement other than easements granted between individual property owners
shall file a written instrument and plat with the Committee showing what
easements and rights-of-way are to be vacated. The Plan Commission, the County
Engineer, and the affected utility companies shall review the instrument and
replat. A jurisdictional control review of any street, road, or highway right-
of-way to be vacated shall be performed by the County Engineer. Should the
results of this review indicate the right-of-way is not under the control of
the county, the author of the instrument shall seek approval from the entity
controlling the right-of-way. The Committee after receiving the comments of
these agencies shall make their recommendations on the plat to the County
Board. If the County Board concurs with the vacation, the County Clerk shall
submit the resolution to the County Board, the instrument and plat to the
County Recorder of Deeds, who then shall officially record and cancel the
entire plat of record or specific portions thereof.
      (2)   Review of plat. After a vacation of a previous plat has been
approved by the County Board and recorded in the office of the County Recorder
of Deeds, the subdivider may then submit his or her petition for the replat of
the subdivision involved. The subdivision shall be classified by the Committee
as either major, minor, or planned unit development (PUD) and shall then
proceed in accordance with the regulations established for the classification
given to the subdivision.

oil, and other pollutants as targeted. Due to the program standards, the county
was deemed to possess a municipal separate stormwater system (MS4). The county
is required to have an approved permit program as promulgated by the State
Environmental Protection Agency and is required to follow the rules regarding
erosion and sediment control. The county has passed an ordinance requiring any
project disturbing more than one acre of ground to incorporate proper erosion
and sediment controls.
   (B)   All developers, builders, and subdividers disturbing more than one
acre of ground are required to adhere to the county ordinance on erosion and
sediment controls. They should contact the County Planning and Zoning office to
determine current requirements for site plans, review of construction plans,
ongoing site inspections, expectations and responsibilities of the contractor
and follow-up reviews. These requirements are likely to change over time, so it
is incumbent upon the applicant to know what is expected by the county before
design work begins.
   (C)   All developers and subdividers are strongly encouraged to design for
low impact development (LID) in regards to stormwater design. LID preserves
open space and minimizes land disturbances. This leads to the protection of
natural features and areas both on and off the development site. For example,
the use of buffer strips along natural drainage ways and existing drainage
swales and waterways helps lower the impact of stormwater leaving the site. It
also leads to fewer human-made controls that need to be installed to meet the
NPDES permit requirements. There are many emerging techniques, both natural and
human-made, that are available for LID. Many of these techniques can lead to
lower design and construction costs versus traditional methods when properly
applied.

   (C)   Adequate drainage shall be provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards; and
   (D)   For any proposed subdivision greater than 50 lots or five acres,
whichever is the lesser, the developer shall show the base flood elevation date
for each lot of the subdivision, and if the base flood elevation data is not
available, the developer shall compute and provide this data for each lot of
the subdivision.

§ 154.071 PARKS, SCHOOL SITES, AND THE LIKE.
   In subdividing property, due consideration shall be given to the dedication
of suitable sites for schools, parks, and playgrounds, so as to conform as
nearly as possible to the recommendations of the Committee and county zoning
regulations. The provisions should be indicated on the preliminary plan in
order that the determination may be made regarding the manner in which the
areas will be dedicated to or acquired by the county, or other public agency.

§ 154.073 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Any parcel of land five acres or more can be considered as developable
as a planned unit development (PUD) when both the subdivider and the Committee
concur in the pre-application conference that the land is best developed as a
PUD. The Committee shall approve the PUD only if it finds that the PUD
satisfies all of the following standards:
      (1)   Is consistent with the comprehensive plan of the county;
      (2)   Makes appropriate provisions for the necessary drainage ways,
wooded areas, rough terrain and other similar areas for an effective and
unified treatment of the development possibilities of the project site;
      (3)   Is in harmony with existing and proposed development in the area
surrounding the project site; and
      (4)   Its approval will not represent any increased maintenance burden on
roads, drainage ways, or public utilities to the county over the normal
maintenance that would have been incurred if the subdivision were developed as
a standard subdivision.
   (B)   (1)   Upon classification of any plat as a PUD by the Committee, the
subdivider is then required to submit to the County Zoning Administrator a
letter requesting joint subdivision and zoning action. This letter should
contain an outline of the development proposals and a copy of the PUD plat
drawn in accordance with the standards of §§
154.025 through
154.035. The Zoning Administrator shall arrange to have a joint meeting of the
Committee and the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days of the submission of
the plat and give notice to the subdivider of the time and place of the
meeting.
      (2)   Zoning Board of Appeals and the Committee approval: the plat shall
be processed the same as any other subdivision plat. All PUDs must be approved
by a two-thirds vote of the members of the County Board. Since PUDs combine
zoning and subdivision procedures, all hearings shall comply with publication
and notice requirements of the state and the county zoning ordinance.

§ 154.087 STREET DESIGN.
   The following requirements shall be incorporated into the design of all
roads.
   (A)   Horizontal alignment.
      (1)   Horizontal curves. When a roadway has a deflection angle of one
degree or greater, the designer must design the roadway with a horizontal
curve. The arterials and collectors should have a minimum centerline radius of
300 feet but should avoid minimum radii to minimize using maximum
superelevation rates. All other types of streets shall have a minimum radius of
100 feet. The arterials and collectors should have a minimum length of curve of
500 feet if the deflection angle is five degrees or less. If the deflection
angle is five degrees or greater, the minimum length of curve shall be
consistent with the BLR Manual.
      (2)   Superelevation. The selection of a maximum allowable superelevation
and superelevation rate shall conform to the appropriate articles of the latest
revision of the BLR Manual.
   (B)   Vertical alignment.
       (1)   Grades. The maximum profile grade for all streets shall be 8% and
the minimum grade on all streets shall be 0.50%. All grades shall be subject to
the approval of the County Engineer. If an engineering design or construction
situation arises not covered by the ordinance herein, the option of the County
Engineer or county representative shall be final.
      (2)   Vertical curves. All grade changes shall be connected by vertical
curves. The length of the vertical curve will depend on the algebraic
difference between the two tangent grades and required site distance. The
minimum crest and sag vertical curve length for all arterial and collector
streets shall be consistent with the BLR Manual. The minimum crest and sag
vertical curve length for all other roadways shall be 30 feet.
   (C)   Cross-section elements.  
      (1)   Guidelines. All streets to be constructed by the subdivider shall
be in accordance with the following guidelines and the BLR Manual, which are
subject in every case to the discretion of the County Engineer. See Appendix A
and Appendix B for additional details.
      (2)   Widths.
         (a)   Generally.

   11.   Alleys              10 feet minimum
 
         (b)   Increased width. Increased widths may be used depending in the
anticipated traffic volumes and parking demands. The pavement widths shall be
determined by the County Engineer after consultation with the subdivider’s
engineer.
      (3)   Parking.  The subdivider shall evaluate the demand for parking as
required in the BLR Manual.
      (4)   Medians and islands. The subdivider shall evaluate the need for
medians and islands as required in the BLR Manual. No sign may be installed in
the median which blocks the sight distance at the intersection. If a sign is to
be installed, detailed plans for the sign shall be submitted with the
construction plans for approval. In no case shall an island or median contain
any other sign or structure except as may be placed for traffic control under
the direction of the County Engineer. The subdivider may landscape medians or
islands. Ground cover may not exceed a maximum height of 12 inches. Any
additional living plant material must be installed to allow visibility across,
over, or through medians and islands at a height of three to ten feet above the
adjacent roadway pavements.
      (5)   Curb and gutter. The subdivider shall design the barrier curb and
gutter in accordance with the BLR Manual. Mountable curb and “V” gutters shall
not be allowed adjacent to roadway pavement or shoulders.
      (6)   Cross slopes. All streets with the exception of an alley shall have
a minimum transverse cross slope of 1.5% sloping away from the centerline of
the roadway. Alley cross-sections may be V-shaped with transverse slopes up to
2.5% toward or away from the centerline of the roadway. If the alley has a
transverse slope toward the center of the roadway, the vertical alignment shall
be designed to ensure positive drainage to a storm sewer system.
      (7)   Sidewalks. All sidewalks constructed by the subdivider shall comply
with the State Accessibility Code, being 71 Ill. Admin. Code §§ 400.110 et seq.
The minimum sidewalk width shall be five feet and minimum thickness shall be
five inches. The minimum clear width at any isolated point along an accessible
route shall be three feet. The sidewalk cross slope shall not exceed 2.0%.
Sidewalks should be separated from roadways by curbs, planted parkways, or
other barriers, which will be continuous except at driveways or alleys.
   (D)   Driveways. Residential driveway widths shall be 12 feet minimum and
shall not exceed 24 feet, with a minimum thickness of six inches of PCC
pavement. Commercial and industrial driveway widths vary from 24 feet to 35
feet depending on volume of traffic. For two-way driveways, the centerline
should be at right angles to the roadway. Angles less than 60 degrees should
only be used for one-way residential driveways.
   (E)   Cul-de-sacs. There shall be a minimum outside radius of 50 feet for
residential, commercial, and industrial cul-de-sacs. Streets with cul-de-sacs
should not be greater than 500 feet in length unless approved by the Committee
and County Board.
   (F)   Intersections.
      (1)   Curb or radius pavement returns at street intersections shall be
rounded by radii of at least 25 feet.
      (2)   Roads shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles, and the angle of intersection should be within 15 degrees of the
perpendicular. Under restricted conditions, where obtaining the right-of-way to
straighten the angle of intersection would be impractical, an intersection
angle up to 30 degrees from the perpendicular may be used.
      (3)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
additions (or their proper protection where adjoining property is not
subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements. The width
of the streets in new subdivisions shall not be less than the minimum street
widths established herein. The street arrangement must also be so as to cause
no hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and
seek to provide convenient access thereto.
   (G)   Electric distribution. The underground electrical distribution system
shall be installed on utility easements along rear or side lot lines per §
154.086.
   (H)   Street lighting. The subdivider shall have the option to install
street lights along public streets in the county in accordance of the American
National Standard For Roadway Lighting prepared by the American National
Standards Institute, published by the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (NEMA), and duly adopted by reference from time to time by the
County Board. If the subdivider chooses to install street lighting, the layout
of the streetlights are required on a photometric plan for approval by the
Committee and the County Engineer. The lighting performance standards shall
meet the City of Decatur Zoning Ordinance, § XXVIII.
   (I)   Pavement design.  
      (1)   The subdivider shall design the pavement structure according to
soil boring information taken from the proposed site with the methods detailed
in the BLR Manual. The minimum pavement thicknesses shall not be less than the
pavement thicknesses detailed in Appendix A and Appendix B. The pavement
structure shall be constructed according to the requirements of the SSRB
adopted by IDOT including supplement specifications of this state.
       (2)   These requirements are the minimum standards of construction only
and do not preclude construction of roads and streets to higher standards, at
the subdivider’s expense upon approval by the County Engineer.
   (J)   Drainage design.
      (1)   Methods of determining stormwater runoff rate and volume. Drainage
and storage facilities shall be designed using the Rational Method of
calculating runoff discharge rate and total volume for watersheds 50 acres or
less. The Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Method (TR20 or TR55)
can be used for any watershed but shall be required for watersheds over 50
acres.
      (2)   Detention. The detention reservoir shall be sized using one of the
methods stated in division (J)(1) above releasing a ten-year storm event for
the existing pre-developed condition while detaining the 50-year storm event
for the proposed post-developed condition. If the imperviousness is reduced by
the proposed development, no detention shall be required. The stormwater
storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event
that a storm in excess of the 50-year return frequency storm occurs. The
emergency overflow shall be designed to safely convey a 100-year storm.
      (3)   Controlling entity. If the detention reservoir is being released
into a watershed governed by a more controlling entity, the detention reservoir
shall meet the controlling entities’ design criteria on detention reservoir
design.
      (4)   Retention. Retention reservoir stormwater system shall be designed
with all the items required for detention storage and the following. There
shall be a restrictor, weir, or other device to reduce flow out of the
reservoir in order to store the required volume above normal pool elevation.
Minimum normal water depth shall be six feet. If fish are to be used to keep
the reservoir clean, a minimum normal depth of ten feet shall be required.
Aeration hardware to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided, if necessary.
Design calculations to prove the effectiveness of the aeration hardware shall
be submitted with the construction plans.
      (5)   Freeboard. Detention/retention reservoirs shall have adequate
capacity to contain the storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff with a
minimum of one foot of freeboard above the water surface of flow in a 100-year
emergency overflow storm event.
      (6)   Stormwater facilities. Where development of a property presents the
threat of flooding or damage by flash flood runoff to downstream residents, the
facilities for stormwater runoff control shall be constructed prior to any
other construction on the project site.
      (7)   Ditch. When the rural estate section for streets is allowed, the
pipe running longitudinally along the roadway shall conform to the requirements
of division (J)(9) below, storm sewers, and the details shown in Appendices B
and D to this chapter. If the ditch capacity calculations show the headwater
for the maximum design year encroaching onto the roadway, the subdivider shall
provide additional appropriately spaced inlets to convey the water away from
the roadway. If it is not feasible to outlet the water from the proposed site
to a natural drainage course using the rural estate section, with prior
permission from the County Engineer, the subdivider may use the open ditch
method for rural residential streets. If the open ditch method is utilized, the
minimum ditch grade allowed shall be 0.3% to minimize ponding. All ditch grades
greater than 4% shall be paved with concrete, as directed by the County
Engineer. The open ditch shall be trapezoidal in shape with a one-foot minimum
ditch bottom. The foreslopes and backslopes shall not be greater than 1V:2H.
Design storm frequencies for rural and urban roadways shall be in accordance
with the BLR Manual. All ditch capacities shall be determined with the methods
described in the latest revision of the IDOT Drainage Manual.
      (8)   Typical residential lot grading. All lot drainage patterns for
residential development shall convey positive drainage away from the proposed
residence as shown in Appendix C and Appendix D.
      (9)   Storm sewers. Storm sewers shall be designed in accordance with the
BLR Manual. Size the storm sewer system using a ten-year flood event. The
minimum size for storm sewers shall be 12 inches for main lines and eight
inches for lateral lines along all roadways. The minimum velocity allowed in
storm sewer systems is three feet/second flowing full. Pipe and fittings shall
be solid wall conforming to Class B material requirements in § 550 of the SSRB.
Single-wall corrugated plastic pipe will not be allowed.
      (10)   Culverts. All culverts shall be designed in accordance with the
IDOT Drainage Manual. The minimum permissible diameter culvert for entrances is
12 inches and 18 inches for all other roadway facilities.
      (11)   Surface and subsurface drains. All lots shall have access to a
drain inlet placed on public right-of-way for surface and subsurface stormwater
sources. All surface and subsurface drains such as sump pumps, roof drains, and
the like shall be connected to these inlets underground. Maintenance of these
drainage systems shall be the responsibility of the homeowner from the point of
connection at the inlet back to the source of water collection. Water from
these sources shall not be allowed to dump from a lot onto the surface of the
roadway right-of-way. Directing this drainage towards an existing surface swale
or drainage way such as a creek or stream will be allowed, provided all other
applicable drainage design requirements of this chapter are satisfied.
         (a)   Curb and gutter sections. Inlets and manholes shall be placed on
public right-of-way allowing access for each lot to connect to a drainage
structure.
         (b)   Rural estate sections. The subdivider shall require the home
builder to install an inlet or catch basin on the storm sewer line. This
requirement shall be included on the subdivision plat. The drainage structure
shall be installed upstream of the driveway entrance to the lot if possible.
The subdivider shall install the storm sewer in such a manner that each lot
will have access to it.
   (K)   Final plans. Final engineering plans shall show complete details for
all items covered in this section. Plans, specifications, and all calculations
for stormwater runoff control and storm sewers shall be submitted for review
and approval as part of the final plat submittal.
(Ord. O-72-5-08, passed 5-8-2008)
LOT AND BLOCK DESIGN
§ 154.100 BLOCKS.
   (A)   No block shall be longer than 1,000 feet between street lines. Blocks
750 feet or longer shall have a cross walk near the center of the block. The
right-of-way for these walks shall not be less than ten feet in width.
   (B)   (1)   Where it is desirable to subdivide a parcel of land which
because of its size or location, does not permit any allotment directly related
to a normal street arrangement, there may be established a “place”.
      (2)   A PLACE may be in the form of a court, a non-connecting street or
other arrangement; provided, however, that proper access shall be given to all
lots from a dedicated place (street or court) and the minimum size of each
allotment of this sort shall be permanently established so as to ensure a
building arrangements commensurate with the foregoing requirements for the
customary forms of subdivision of land. When a court is not used, provisions
shall be made for utility vehicles, including snowplows, to turn around at the
non-connecting end of the street. These provisions shall meet the approval of
the County Engineer.

unless a permanent easement of access to a public street was of record prior to
the adoption of this chapter.
   (B)   All sidelines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines, or
radial to curved street lines.
   (C)   Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the
maintenance of building lines on both front and side. In normal cases the width
shall not be less than the amount of the established building lines on the side
streets plus a minimum width for a building and any side yard requirements as
may be provided for by a zoning ordinance.

   (D)   To prevent overcrowding of land with buildings and thereby ensure
maximum living and working conditions and prevent blight and slums;

uses;

bodies, as provided hereinafter; and

§ 155.027 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The Zoning Board of Appeals after a public hearing may
approve a variance, only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth, where
the Board makes findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter
prescribed, and further finds that there are practical difficulties or
particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this chapter.
   (B)   Standards for variances.  
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not vary the regulations of this
chapter, as authorized in division (A) hereof, unless it shall make findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
         (a)   Because of the physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a hardship to the owner would
result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulation were carried out;
         (b)   The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning district;
         (c)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and
has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the
property;
         (e)   The granting of the variance will not be significantly
detrimental to the public welfare or substantially injurious to other property
or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and
         (f)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property; substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets; increase the danger of fire; endanger the public safety; or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may approve any conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established in this division (B) to reduce or
minimize the effect of the variance upon other property in the neighborhood and
to better carry out the general intent of this chapter.
   (C)   Authorized variances. Variances shall be approved by the Zoning Board
of Appeals only in accordance with the standards established in division (B)
above, and may be considered in the following instances:
      (1)   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback
required by the applicable regulations;
      (2)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but in no
event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 90%
of the required area and width;
      (3)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided the substantial use of the
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of

(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.028 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Authority. For the purposes of promoting the public health, safety,
morals, welfare, and conserving values of property throughout the county, and
lessening or avoiding congestion in the public streets and highways, the County
Board may from time to time, in the manner hereinafter set forth, amend the
regulations imposed and the districts created by this chapter, provided that in
all amendatory ordinances adopted under the authority of this section, due
allowance shall be made for existing conditions, the conservation of property
values, the direction of building development to the best advantage of the
entire county, and the use to which property is devoted at the time of adoption
of any amendatory ordinance.
   (B)   Findings of fact and recommendations of the Zoning Board of Appeals.  
      (1)   Within a reasonable time after the close of the hearing on a
proposed amendment, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make written findings of
fact and shall submit the same together with its recommendation to the County
Board. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change the
zoning classification of particular property, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case
with respect to the following matters:
         (a)   Existing use of property within the general area of the property
in question;
         (b)   The zoning classification of property within the general area of
the property in question;
         (c)   The suitability of the property in question for the uses
permitted under the existing zoning classifications; and
         (d)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which may have taken place
since the day the property in question was placed in its present zoning
classification.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not recommend the adoption of a
proposed amendment unless it finds the adoption of such an amendment is in the
public interest. The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend the adoption of an
amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any
higher classification than that requested by the applicant. For the purpose of
this division (B)(2), the R1 District shall be considered the highest
classification and the M2 District shall be considered the lowest
classification.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.029 SPECIAL USE.
   (A)   Purpose. The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based
upon the division of the county into districts, within which districts the use
of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot
be properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. The
special uses fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally concerning a public
interest; and
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the Zoning Board of
Appeals unless the Board shall find that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use
will not substantially be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
welfare, and morals;
      (2)   The special use will not substantially be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, or substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;
      (3)   The establishment of the special use will not substantially impede
the normal and orderly development and improvements of surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
      (4)   The adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided;
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in public streets; and
      (6)   The special use shall in all other aspects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as the
regulations may in each instance be modified by the County Board pursuant to
the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (C)   Planned developments. Planned developments are of a substantially
different character from other special uses that specific and additional
standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern recommendation of the
Zoning Board of Appeals and the action of the County Board.
      (1)   Use exceptions. In the case of residential, business, or
manufacturing planned developments, the Zoning Board may recommend, and the
County Board may authorize, that there be in part of the area of the
development and for the duration of development, specified uses not permitted
by the use regulations of the district in which the development is located,
provided the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find:
         (a)   The uses permitted by the exception are necessary or desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;
         (b)   The uses permitted by the exception are not of such a nature or
so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding
neighborhood;
         (c)   Not more than 20% of the ground area or of the gross floor area
of the development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the exception;
         (d)   In a manufacturing planned development, the additional uses
allowed by exception shall conform with the performance standards of the
district in which the development is located, as set forth in §§
155.135 through
155.137; and
         (e)   The use exceptions so allowed are reflected by the appropriate
zoning district symbols and so recorded on the zoning district maps.
      (2)   Bulk regulations. In case of any planned development, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may recommend, and the County Board may authorize, exceptions
to the applicable bulk regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of the
development, provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find:
         (a)   The exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less than beneficial to the residents or occupants of
the development, as well as of neighboring properties, than would be obtained
under the bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed on a
separate zoning lots;
         (b)   The overall floor area ratio of a residential planned
development would not exceed by more than 15% the maximum floor area ratio
which would be determined on the basis of the floor area ratio required for the
individual uses in the planned development, as stipulated in §§
155.183 and
155.184;
         (c)   The maximum lot area per dwelling unit requirements of this
chapter shall not be decreased by more than 15% in any development containing
residential uses, and that there shall be available to each residential
building and immediately adjacent thereto (including the land area upon which
it is erected) the minimum amount of land area required for the building under
the lot area per dwelling unit provisions of this chapter;
         (d)   The spacing between principal buildings shall be at least
equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly
developed under the terms of this chapter on separate zoning lots, due
consideration being given to the openness normally afforded by intervening
streets and alleys; and
         (e)   Along the periphery of the planned developments yards shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which the
development is located.
   (D)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special use
permit the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the County Board shall
stipulate any conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance, and operation of the special use as deemed necessary
for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the
standards and requirements specified in division (B) of this section. In all
cases in which special uses are granted, the County Board shall require
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with.

specifically provided hereinafter except in conformity with the off-street
parking and loading regulations of the district in which the building is
located;
   (F)   The minimum yards, parking spaces, and open spaces, including lot area
per family, required by this chapter for each and every building existing at
the time of passage of this chapter or for any building hereafter erected,
shall not be encroached upon or considered as part of the yard or parking space
or open space required for any other building, nor shall any lot area be
reduced below the requirements of this chapter for the district in which the
lot is located; and/or
   (G)   Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be
located on a lot as herein defined and in no case shall there be more than one
main building on one lot except as specifically provided hereinafter.

GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 155.045 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, and welfare.
   (B)   Where the conditions imposed by the provision of this chapter upon the
use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more
restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other
provision of this chapter or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or
regulation of any kind, the regulations are more restrictive (or which impose
higher standards or requirements) shall govern.
   (C)   This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or
any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this
chapter are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than
the easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the requirements of this
comprehensive agreement shall govern.
   (D)   No building, structure, or use which was not lawfully existing at the
time of the adoption of this chapter shall become or be made lawful solely by
reason of the adoption of this chapter; and to the extent that, and in any
manner that, the lawful building, structure, or use is in conflict with the
requirements of this chapter, the building, structure, or use remains lawful
hereunder.
   (E)   All territory which may hereafter become a part of the unincorporated
area of this county, by the dissolution of any incorporated city, village, or
town, or by detachment from any city, village, or town, shall automatically
become classified as a part of the zoning district under this chapter most
closely analogous to the district classification the territory was in while a
part of the incorporated area, if it was subject to zoning regulation while
within the incorporated area. If the territory, while within the incorporated
area, was not subject to zoning regulations, then it shall automatically, in
the event aforesaid, become classified as part of the zoning district under
this chapter most closely analogous to and which includes the use or uses
actually being made of the territory at the time of the dissolution or
detachment, which classification shall remain until changed by the order of the
County Board enacted as near as may be in the manner provided for the district
amendments as set out in §
155.027.
   (F)   Whenever any street, alley, highway, or other public way is vacated by
official action, the zoning district adjoining each side of the street, alley,
or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of the vacation,
and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to
all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
   (G)   (1)   All areas within the unincorporated territory of the county,
which are under water and not shown as included within any district, shall be
subject to all of the regulations of the district which immediately adjoins the
water area.
      (2)   Where the water area adjoins two or more districts, the boundaries
of each district shall be construed to extend to the center of the water area.
   (H)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to be a consent,
license, or permit to use any property or to locate, construct, or maintain any
building, structure, facility, or to carry on any trade, industry, occupation,
or activity.
   (I)   The provisions in this chapter are cumulative and additional
limitations upon all other laws and ordinance, heretofore passed or which may
be passed hereafter, governing any subject matter in this chapter.

of this chapter not specifically included in the judgment; and
   (B)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any provision of this chapter to a particular property,
building, or other structure, that judgment shall not affect the application of

buildings occurring hereafter, and all enlargements of or additions to existing
uses occurring hereafter shall be subject to all regulations of this chapter
which are applicable to the zoning districts in which the buildings, uses, or
land shall be located.
   (B)   However, where a building permit for a building or structure has been
issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of this chapter, and
provided that construction is begun within six months of the effective date and
diligently prosecuted to completion, the building or structure may be completed
in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of which the building permit
has been issued, and further may upon completion be occupied under a
certificate of occupancy by the use for which originally designated, subject
thereafter to the provisions of §§
155.065 through
155.070, nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses.
   (C)   Where the Zoning Administrator has issued a special use permit, or a
permit for a variance pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the permit
shall become null and void unless work thereon is substantially underway within
one year of the date of issuance of the permit by the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular
special use and shall expire if the special use shall cease for more than one
year for any reason.

§ 155.051 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BUILDING. This definition is broadened to also include structures built
for the support, shelter, or enclosure of persons, animals, chattels, or
movable property of any kind but which are not permanently affixed to the land,
such as structures built on skids and/or merely placed on the ground.
      STRUCTURE. The definition is broadened to also include anything
constructed or erected but which is not permanently affixed to the land.
   (B)   Regulations. The follow regulations shall apply to all accessory

whichever is more restrictive, 100 feet from the freeway right-of-way line and
30 feet from the right-of-way line of frontage roads and other roads of the
internal circulation system. In the case of unusual changes in alignment of the
intersection highway or unusual topographical characteristics which would cause
undue hardship in the application of this requirement, a variance for a lesser
setback distance from the intersecting highway may be granted.
      (3)   Front setback.
         (a)   The front setback required for an accessory building shall be
the same as the front setback which would be required for a principal building
fronting on that street. The required setback would be either the front setback
specified for the zoning district in §
155.183, or the average setback of the existing buildings in that block, but
not over 50% more than the specified setback for the zoning district (see §
155.184(B)(1) and (4)).
         (b)   On lots having double frontage, a front setback shall be
required from both front property lines.
      (4)   Side setback.
         (a)   Except as noted below, all accessory building must be set back
from any side property line at least the distance specified as the side setback
for a principal structure in the zoning district (see §
155.183).
         (b)   On corner lots, the street-side setback shall be the same as the
front yard setback which would be required for a principal building fronting on
that street. The non-street-side setback shall be the same as the side setbacks
identified in division (B)(4)(a) above.
         (c)   Where a side property line abuts an alley, no side setback shall
be required.
         (d)   If an accessory building is not used as a residence or to store
livestock and is to be set back at least 60 feet from the front property line,
then the side setback may be reduced to three feet.
      (5)   Rear setback.
         (a)   Except as noted below, all accessory buildings must be set back
from any rear property line at least the distance specified as the side setback
for a principal structure in that zoning district (see § 155.183).
         (b)   On residential corner lots, the rear lines of the corner
property shall be treated as side property lines and require the applicable
side setback.
         (c)   Where a rear property line abuts an alley, no rear setback shall
be required.
         (d)   If an accessory building is not used as a residence or to store
livestock and is to be set back at least 60 feet from the front property line,
then the rear setback may be reduced to three feet.
      (6)   Accessory building shall not cover more than 30% of the required
rear yard, and not more than 50% of any required side yard, as specified for
that zoning district in §
155.183.
      (7)   No accessory building shall be placed closer than ten feet from a
principal building. No accessory building shall be attached to a principal
building unless the accessory building meets all of the construction
requirements for a principal building.
      (8)   Residential accessory building, including those on less than ten
acres zoned A1 – Agricultural, shall not exceed 25 feet in height, measured
from the top of the lower floor to the peak of the roof.
      (9)   Building permits.
         (a)   A building permit shall be required for any accessory building
which is longer than ten feet on any side.
         (b)   No accessory building shall be constructed and no building
permit shall be issued for an accessory building prior to the time of
construction of the principal building to which it is accessory.
      (10)   Mobile homes and manufactured homes used as accessory buildings.
See §
155.048.
      (11)   Accessory building shall only be built for and used for permitted
accessory uses. Guest houses, servants quarters, apartments, and the like shall
not be permitted as accessory buildings, except when issued a special use
permit.

§ 155.052 BULK REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Continued conformity with bulk regulations. The maintenance of yards
and other open space and minimum lot area legally required for a building shall
be a continuing obligation of the owner of the building or of the property on
which it is located, as long as the building is in existence. Furthermore, no
legally required yards, other open space, or minimum lot area allocated to any
building shall, by virtue of change of ownership or for any other reason, be
used to satisfy yard, other open space, or minimum lot area requirements for
any other building.
   (B)   Division of zoning lots. No improved zoning lot shall hereafter be
divided into two or more zoning lots unless all improved zoning lots resulting
from each division shall conform with all the applicable bulk regulations of
the zoning district in which the property is located. However, with respect to
the resubdivision of improved zoning lots in the R6 Districts, side yard
requirements shall not apply between attached buildings.
   (C)   Location and required open space. All yards and other open spaces
allocated to a building or dwelling group shall be located on the same zoning
lot as the building or dwelling group.
   (D)   Required yards; existing buildings. No yards now or hereafter provided
for a building existing on the effective date of this chapter shall
subsequently be reduced below, or further reduced if already less than, the
minimum yard requirements of this chapter for equivalent new construction.
   (E)   Permitted obstructions in required yards. The following shall not be
considered to be obstructions when located in the required yards specified:
      (1)   In all yards. Open terraces not over four feet above the average
level of adjoining ground but not including a permanently roofed-over terrace
or porch; awnings and canopies; steps four feet or less above grade which are
necessary for access to a permitted building or for access to a zoning lot from
a street or alley; chimneys projecting 18 inches or less into the yard;
recreational and laundry-drying equipment, arbors and trellises; and flag
poles;
      (2)   In front yards. One-story bay windows projecting three feet or less
into the yard; overhanging eaves and gutters projecting three feet or less into
the yard; fuel pumps and air and water service, provided they shall be set back
at least 15 feet from the front lot line;
      (3)   In rear yards. Enclosed, attached, or detached off-street parking
spaces; open off-street parking spaces; accessory sheds, tool rooms, and
similar building or structures for domestic or agricultural storage; balconies;

less into the yard; and
      (4)   In side yards. Overhanging eaves and gutters projecting 18 inches
or less into the yard; fuel pumps and air and water service, provided they
shall be set back at least 15 feet from the side lot line.
   (F)   Floor area ratio application in particular cases. In all cases where
two or more continuous zoning lots are in common ownership and there was at the
adoption date of this chapter an existing building on one of the lots with less
than the permitted maximum floor area ratio; the owner may elect to add the
unused portion of the floor area ratio of the existing building to the maximum
floor area ratio of any addition to the existing building to be constructed on
the adjoining zoning lot; and in the event the existing building was lawfully
existing at the date of adoption of this chapter and exceeds the permitted
maximum floor area ratio, an addition to the existing building to be
constructed on an adjoining lot shall be entitled to the maximum floor area
ratio permitted in the district in which it is located.

§ 155.053 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this chapter shall apply as follows.
      (1)   For all building and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
districts in which the buildings or uses are located. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, and
provided that construction is begun within six months of the effective date and
diligently prosecuted to completing, parking, and loading of the facilities in
the amounts required for the issuance of the building permit may be provided in
lieu of any different amounts required by this chapter.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for the increase in intensity of use. However, no
building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be required to provide the additional
parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units
of measurement shall equal not less than 15% of the units of measurement
existing upon the effective date of this chapter, in which event parking or
loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for the total increase;
provided, however, that in the case of the expansion or alteration of
residential buildings required parking or loading facilities shall be provided
on the basis of the total required units of measurement for the entire capacity
of the building.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for the new use. However, if the building or structure was
erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional parking or
loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements
for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were
subject to the parking and loading provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing parking facilities. Accessory off-street parking facilities
in existence on the effective date of this chapter and located on the same lot
as the building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if
already less than shall not be further reduced below, the requirements for a
similar new building or use under the provision of this chapter.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings provided that
all regulations herein governing the location, design, and operation of the
facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this chapter,
which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse,
explosion, or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished, or
repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except
that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of
the damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However,
in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading
facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses
or construction.
   (E)   Control of off-site parking facilities. In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, the facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. The possession may be either deed or long-
term lease, the term of the lease to be determined by the Zoning Board of
Appeals. The owner of the land on which the parking facilities are to be
located shall be bound by covenants filed on record in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds, requiring the owner, his or her heirs, and assigns to
maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use
served or of the lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
   (F)   Submission of plot plan. Any application for the building permit, or
for a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required, shall
include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensional, showing
any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this
chapter.

155.999
§ 155.054 EXISTING SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Where a use is classified as a special use in the district in which it
is zoned under this chapter, and exists as a special or permitted use under the
terms of this chapter immediately prior to the date of the adoption of this
chapter, it shall be considered to be a legal special use.
   (B)   Where a use is not allowed as a special or permitted use in the
district in which it is zoned under this chapter, and exists as a special use
under the terms of this chapter immediately prior to the date of the adoption
of this chapter, it shall be considered to be a nonconforming use and shall be
subject to the applicable nonconforming use provisions of §§
155.065 through
155.070.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES
§ 155.065 INTENT.
   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures,
characteristics of use, and signs which were lawful before this chapter was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit those nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but
not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a
structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and
land in combination, shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this
chapter by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to
be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature
which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
   (C)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, the excavating or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.066 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   (1)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on
any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter. The lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership.
      (2)   This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which the lot is located.
      (3)   Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action
of the Board of Appeals.
   (B)   In any district, if two or more lots or combinations of lots and
portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at
the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the
lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for the purpose of this
chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this
chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with
width or area below requirements stated in this chapter.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.067 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
   Where at the time of the passage of this chapter lawful use of land exists
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and
where the use involves no individual structure with a reasonable fair market
value exceeding $1,000, the use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, provided:
   (A)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter;
   (B)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion
of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by that use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
   (C)   If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
more than six months, any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the land is
located; and
   (D)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.068 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   (A)   No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;
   (B)   Should the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its
reasonable fair market value at the time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter; and
   (C)   Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.069 NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use exists, involving individual structures with a reasonable
fair market value of $1,000 or more, or of structure and premises in this
chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for that use at the time of
adoption or amendment to this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside the building;
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a conditional use be changed to
another nonconforming use, provided the Board of Appeals, either by general
rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed
use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district then the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting the change, the Board of Appeals may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of
this chapter;
   (D)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed;
   (E)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six months the structure, or
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
   (F)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. DESTRUCTION, for the purpose of this division
(F), is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50% of the reasonable fair
market value at the time of destruction.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.070 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
    (A)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of any structure containing
a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of the current reasonable
fair market value of the nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may
be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall
not be increased.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
the official.

   (B)   Goal. The agricultural zone is established as a zone in which
agricultural and certain related uses are encouraged as the principal uses of
land. The specific intent is to facilitate the proper use of lands best suited
to agricultural through preventing the admixture of urban and rural uses which
creates incompatibility and conflict, places unbalanced tax loads on
agriculture lands to help pay for urban services, and contributes to the
premature termination of agricultural pursuits. This zone is also designed to
prevent the health hazards brought about by the illogical placement of
inappropriately high residential densities in otherwise open countryside.
   (C)   Use regulations. A lot or premises shall only be use for the following
uses.
      (1)   Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted only on a
ten-acre minimum tract size:
         (a)   Farming, including the usual buildings and structures used for
agricultural purposes;
         (b)   Truck and flower gardening, nurseries, orchards, and
greenhouses;
         (c)   Single-family dwellings, including mobile homes and manufactured
homes, within the limitations set forth in division (C)(1)(i) below;

any building housing animals be located at least 75 feet from all property
lines;
         (g)   Grain elevators and the usual accessory structures including
buildings for seasonal or temporary storage of grain whenever the elevator and
temporary storage are located upon or adjacent to a railroad right-of-way;
         (h)   Home occupation;
         (i)   Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to any of
the above uses. A farm may contain dwellings for workers employed on the
premises or direct relatives of the farm owner, but no more than one dwelling
unit per ten acres of tillable land; and
         (j)   The following uses shall be permitted on tracts less than ten
acres, but no smaller than one acre in size:
            1.   Single-family dwellings, in cases where:
               a.   The property contained a habitable residence on or before
January 1, 1970; and
               b.   If the property no longer contains a habitable residence,
the use of the property for crop production is significantly restricted by the
presence of the remnants of the homestead, such as dilapidated structures,
building foundations, or concrete walkways and/or driveways.
            2.   Home occupation; and
            3.   Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to any of
the above uses.
      (2)   Special uses.
         (a)   All permitted uses of the A1 District;

OVERLAY DISTRICTS
§ 155.165 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to provide realistic
controls for assuring safe and convenient access to the development of
properties that adjoin interchanges and discourage the indiscriminate location
of access points along the intersecting highway.
   (B)   Areas of control. The following interchange development standards
shall apply to all commercial, residential, and industrial development within a
radius of one-half mile of the interchange structure except where area of
control extends inside the corporate limits of a municipality. In such a case,
the municipal regulations shall apply.
   (C)   Setback distance from intersecting highway. Buildings and structures
shall be set back at least 80 feet from the right-of-way line of intersecting
highways, or 160 feet from the centerline, whichever is more restrictive, 100
feet from the freeway right-of-way line and 30 feet from the right-of-way line
of frontage roads and other roads of the internal circulation system. In the
case of unusual changes in alignment of the intersecting highway or unusual
topographical characteristics which would cause undue hardship in the
application of this requirement, a variance for a lesser setback distance from
the intersecting highway may be granted.
   (D)   Limitation of access. The State Department of Transportation has
developed access regulations for particular interchanges based on ramp design
and ramp speed. These regulations shall apply only when they are more
restrictive than the following restrictions. Access from abutting property to
an intersecting highway shall be permitted only at designated access points.
The access shall be located as follows:
      (1)   There shall be no access points located within 700 feet (500 in
urban situations) of the most remote end of taper of any existing or proposed
entrance or exit ramp of an interchange or 700 feet (500 in urban situations)
of median crossovers, or at intervals of less than 700 feet thereafter. A
lesser distance may be permitted upon written approval by the State Department
of Transportation; and
      (2)   To avoid dangerous off-set intersections, public streets along
opposite sides of intersecting highways shall be located either directly
opposite a median strip crossover or separated by at least 300 feet of lateral
distance. A lesser distance may be permitted upon written approval by the State
Department of Transportation.

OFF-STREET PARKING, OFF-STREET LOADING FACILITIES
§ 155.195 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   The off-street parking and off-street loading provisions of this subchapter
shall apply as follows.
   (A)   Accessory off-street parking and off-street loading facilities shall
be provided as required by the regulations of this subchapter, for all
buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established in each
district, after the effective date of this chapter. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, and
provided that construction is begun within six months of the effective date and
diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities in the
amounts required by this chapter for the intended use shall not be required.
   (B)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for the increase in intensity of use. However, no
building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be required to provide any additional
parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units
of measurement shall equal not less than 15% of the units of measurement
existing upon the effective date of this chapter, in which event parking or
loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for the total increase;
provided, however, that in the case of the expansion or alteration of
residential building, required parking or loading facilities shall be provided
on the basis of the total required units of measurement for the entire capacity
of the buildings.
   (C)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter
be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for the new use.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.196 EXISTING PARKING FACILITIES.
   Accessory off-street parking or loading facilities in existence on the
effective date of this chapter, and located on the same lot as the building or
use served shall not hereafter be reduced below (or if already less than shall
not be further reduced below), the requirements for a similar new building or
use under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.197 PERMISSIVE PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities (on the same lot as
the establishment it serves) to serve any existing use of land or buildings,
provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design, and
operations of the facilities are adhered to.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.198 DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.
   For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in
existence on the effective date of this chapter, which subsequently thereto is
damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, and which is
reconstructed, reestablished, or repaired, off-street parking or loading
facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of the damage or
destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.199 CONTROL OF OFF-STREET FACILITIES.
   In cases where parking or loading facilities are permitted on land other
than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, the
facilities shall be in the same possession as the lot occupied by the building
or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. The possession may be
either by deed or long-term lease, the minimum term of the lease to be
determined by the Board. The owner of the land on which the parking or loading
facilities are to be located shall be bound by covenants, filed on record in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds, requiring the owner, his or her heirs, and
assignees to maintain the required number of parking and facilities for the
duration of the use served or the lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
(Ord. O-95-2-12, passed 2-9-2012)
§ 155.200 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   Off-street parking facilities for motor vehicles shall be provided in
accordance with regulations set forth hereinafter.
   (A)   Use. Accessory off-street parking facilities required as accessory to
uses listed herein, shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of
patrons, occupants or employees. (When bus transportation is provided for
patrons, occupants, or employees of a specific establishment, additional open
or enclosed off-street parking spaces for each bus to be parked on the premises
shall be provided in accordance with regulations hereafter for access, in
yards, design, and maintenance and area in accordance with size of buses.)
   (B)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess
of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   (C)   Collective provision. Off-street parking facilities for separate uses
may be provided collectively if a total number of spaces so provided is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements for each use, and provided that
all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces, in relation to
the use served, are adhered to. Further, no parking spaces or portion thereof
shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise
authorized by the Board in accordance with procedures set forth herein in the
variance section of this chapter.
   (D)   Area. A required off-street parking space shall be at least ten feet
in width and at least 20 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles,
ramps, columns, or office or work areas. Enclosed parking spaces shall have a
vertical clearance of at least seven feet.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway of a width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to the parking spaces. All off-street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movement. No driveway across public property at the right-of-way line shall
exceed a width of 25 feet.
   (F)   In yards. Off-street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located
in any yard except a front yard and a side yard adjoining a street. Enclosed
buildings and carports containing off-street parking spaces shall be subject to
applicable yard requirements.
   (G)   Design and maintenance.
      (1)   Open and enclosed parking spaces.  Accessory parking spaces may be
open to the sky or enclosed in a building.
      (2)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking spaces containing four or
more parking spaces shall be improved with a compacted base and a permanent
wearing surface as approved by the designated engineer.
      (3)   Screening and landscaping. All open parking areas, containing more
than four parking spaces, located less than 40 feet from a property line shall
be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on any property
situated in a residential district or any institutional premises by a wall,
fence, or densely compact hedge, not less than five feet nor more than eight
feet in height.
      (4)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall be directed away from residential properties in such a way as not to
create a nuisance, and in a parking area containing 40 or more parking spaces
the light shall be extinguished one-half hour after the close of business,
except as may otherwise be permitted or required by the Board for maintaining
illumination with less candlepower after the time specified above.
      (5)   Repair and services. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any
kind shall be permitted in conjunction with any parking facilities. No gasoline
or motor oil shall be sold in conjunction with any accessory parking facilities
unless the accessory parking facilities are enclosed in a building, in which
case gasoline and motor oil may be sold within the building to the use of the
accessory parking facilities; provided that no sign advertising the sale of
same is visible from outside, and provided further that all gasoline pumps
shall be effectively screened from view from the public way.
   (H)   Location. All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses
erected or established after the effective date of this chapter shall be
located on the same lot as the building or use served. Buildings or uses
existing on the effective date of this chapter which are subsequently altered
or enlarged so as to require the provisions of parking spaces under this
chapter, or new uses established in any business district may be served by
parking facilities located on land other than the lot on which the building or
use served is located, provided that the facilities are within 300 feet walking
distance of a main entrance to the use served.
   (I)   Employee parking. Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall
be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on
the premises at any one time.
   (J)   Required spaces. Off-street parking spaces accessory to designated
uses shall be provided as follows:

indemnify, and hold the county, its employees, board members, and agents
harmless for any action due to or arising out of the construction, maintenance,
decommissioning, deconstruction, and/or operation of the BESS, including the
payment of any attorney’s fee and costs arising out of any action due to or
arising out of the construction, maintenance, decommissioning, and/or operation
of the BESS.
   (E)   The applicant, owner and/or operator of the BESS shall defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless the county and its officers, appointed and elected
officials, employees, attorneys, engineers and agents (collectively and
individually, the “indemnified parties”) from and against any and all claims,
demands, losses, suits, causes of action, damages, injuries, costs, expenses,
and liabilities whatsoever, including attorney’s fees relating to or arising
out of the issuance of the special use permit, other permits, or the
construction, operation, maintenance and removal of the BESS and affiliated
equipment, including, without limitation, liability for property damage or
personal injury (including death or illness), whether the liability is premised
on contract or on tort (including without limitation strict liability or
negligence) or any acts or omissions of the applicant, owner, or operator under
this chapter or the special use permit/other permits, except to the extent any
such claims, demands, losses, suits, causes of action, damages, injuries,
costs, expenses and liabilities arise from the negligence or intentional acts
of such indemnified parties. This general indemnification shall not be
construed as limiting or qualifying the county’s other indemnification rights
available under the law.
   (F)   After the effective date of this chapter, no proposed BESS, as defined
in this chapter and within the county’s jurisdiction, shall proceed with
construction until it has been submitted to and approved by the County Board
and/or its authorized agent in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. O-157-03-25, passed 3-13-2025)
§ 157.11 DECOMMISSIONING.
   Decommissioning will apply to all BESS projects and its equipment/
components. Prior to receiving special use permit approval, the applicant and/
or owner/operator must enter into and agree upon a decommissioning plan and
decommissioning agreement with the county that ensures the BESS project will be
properly decommissioned upon the end of project life or facility abandonment.
   (A)   Decommissioning plan. The applicant shall submit with its special use
application a proposed decommissioning plan that includes the following:
      (1)   The anticipated life expectancy of the BESS project;
      (2)   The funding method(s), for the decommissioning and restoration of
the project site to its original, natural condition prior to the BESS
development;
      (3)   The method of ensuring that funds will be available for
decommissioning and restoration;
      (4)   Disposal of all solid and hazardous waste in accordance with local,
state, and federal waste disposal regulations;
      (5)   The manner in which the site will be restored, including a
description of how any changes to the surrounding areas and other systems
adjacent to the BESS, such as, but not limited to, structural elements,
building penetrations, means of egress, and required fire detection suppression
systems, will be protected during decommissioning, and confirmed as being
acceptable after the system is removed; and
      (6)   A listing of any contingencies for removing an intact operational
energy storage system from service, and for removing an energy storage system
from service that has been damaged by a fire or other event.
      (7)   Prior to receiving a special use permit under this chapter, the
county, the applicant, owner, and/or operator must agree to a written
decommissioning agreement that ensures the BESS project is properly
decommissioned and deconstructed upon the end of project life or facility
abandonment.
      (8)   If the site is damaged or nonfunctioning for any reason, the BESS
project operator shall notify the County Zoning Office within 24 hours and then
shall have six months to bring the project back to its operational capacity. If
for any reason the BESS is not operational or able to store or manage
electricity after six months, the operator/owner shall have six months to
complete decommissioning of the BESS and its equipment.
      (9)   In the event of abandonment of the project or its equipment/
components, the project site property owner/leaseholder shall bear ownership of
the BESS and all of its equipment/components located on the property. The
property owner of the project site shall bear the decommissioning costs in
excess of any funds the county is able to access to ensure proper
decommissioning of the project.
      (10)   In the event of bankruptcy or similar financial default of the
BESS project, the county shall use the decommissioning funds to the greatest
extent possible. There may remain unresolved site issues beyond the scope of
the county’s ability to fund the decommissioning of the BESS. To the extent the
financial assurance provided to the county is insufficient to fund the complete
decommissioning of the BESS, the property owner, the BESS owner, any parent
entity of the BESS owner, any person or entity holding a greater than 20%
interest in the BESS or parent entity of the BESS, any financial creditor or
any other person/entity holding an equity interest in the BESS shall be
responsible for the decommissioning costs of the BESS. Prior to receipt of a
building permit, the above responsible entities shall execute an agreement with
the county agreeing to fund the decommissioning of the BESS should the
decommissioning financial assurance provided to the county be insufficient to
fund the complete decommissioning of the BESS.
      (11)   A provision that the terms of the decommissioning agreement shall
be binding upon the applicant and any of their successors, assigns, or heirs.
      (12)   The county may sell any salvage material to reduce the county’s
expenses related to decommissioning of any project site and shall be granted
access to each site to affect or complete decommissioning. The county may, but
is not required to, allow a reduction of the decommissioning financial
assurance in an amount equal to the salvage value of the BESS.
      (13)   The plan shall include provisions for removal of all structures,
BESS, transmission equipment, buildings, fences, cabling, debris, foundations,
and physical material pertaining to the project, including the cost for
disposal of all materials associated with the BESS. The plan shall also include
provisions for restoration of soil and vegetation and a plan ensuring financial
resources will be available to fully decommission the site.
      (14)   All solid and liquid wastes shall be disposed of in accordance
with all local, state, and federal laws.
      (15)   All hazardous materials shall be handled, stored, transported, and
disposed of in accordance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws.
EMA and HAZMAT officials shall be notified of the handling, storage,
transportation, and disposal of any and all hazardous materials.
   (B)   Decommissioning fund.
      (1)   The cost estimate of decommissioning will be completed by a
licensed Illinois professional engineer chosen by the county at the applicant’s
expense. Payment for the engineer’s fee and any other third-party costs to
prepare decommissioning cost estimates or negotiate decommissioning agreement
(s) is not included in the initial application fee.
      (2)   The decommissioning cost estimate will be reviewed at a minimum
every three years, by the county’s chosen Illinois licensed professional
engineer, and revised, if necessary, at the owner/operator’s expense. The
review and revised agreement are subject to the approval of the County Board.
      (3)   The county reserves the right to require more frequent
decommissioning estimates and cash escrow requirements based on changing
economic conditions.
      (4)   At the conclusion of the project lifespan or when the project has
failed to be commercially operable for greater than six months, the BESS
project’s owner/operator shall notify the County Zoning Office and then has 12
months from the date of notification to decommission the site(s).
(Ord. O-157-03-25, passed 3-13-2025)
§ 157.12 HEARING FACILITATOR.
   (A)   The county may engage the services of a hearing facilitator. The
hearing facilitator shall be an independent contractor who shall conduct a
hearing in accordance with all applicable rules of the ZBA and the county but
has no adjudicatory responsibility other than ruling on requests for
continuances, procedural matters, admissibility of evidence, and the propriety
of any arguments.
   (B)   The hearing facilitator shall be an attorney, licensed to practice in
the State of Illinois. The applicant shall reimburse the county for fees and
costs charged by the hearing facilitator.
(Ord. O-157-03-25, passed 3-13-2025)
§ 157.13 HEARING FACTORS.
   (A)   The County Board may approve a BESS special use permit application if
it finds the evidence complies with federal and state law/regulations and with
the standards of the county’s zoning code and this chapter, including the
factors listed below. The following factors are applied as a balancing test,
not individual requirements to be met.
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the BESS will not
be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or
general welfare;
      (2)   The BESS will not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values of surrounding properties;
      (3)   The establishment of the BESS will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding properties;
      (4)   Adequate public utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or will be provided;
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      (6)   The proposed BESS is not contrary to the objectives of the current
comprehensive plan of the county; and
      (7)   The BESS shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable
regulations of this chapter and the zoning district in which it is located,
except as such regulations may, in each instance, be modified pursuant to the
recommendations of and approved by the County Board.
   (B)   The County Board may also stipulate conditions, guarantees and
restrictions, upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance,
operation, and other aspects of the BESS as are deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards
and requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. O-157-03-25, passed 3-13-2025)
§ 157.14 FEE SCHEDULE AND PERMITTING PROCESSES.
   (A)   Application fees.
      (1)   Prior to processing any special use permit application for a BESS,
the applicant must submit a certified check to the county for the application
fee equal to $2,500 per megawatt (MW) of proposed nameplate capacity, up to a
maximum fee of $250,000. If the total nameplate capacity is below one MW, the
application fee shall be reduced pro rata based on kilowatt (kW) capacity.
These funds shall be placed in an FDIC insured account and will be used to
cover the county’s cost incurred in processing the application.
      (2)   Should the actual costs to the county exceed the submitted
application fee, the applicant shall be responsible for those additional costs
and shall remit additional funds to the county within 15 days of receipt of a
request from the county. No hearings on an application shall be conducted nor
final decisions rendered on an application if there are application fees due to
the county.
      (3)   Any unused amounts of the application fee shall be refunded to the
applicant within six months of the County Board rendering a final decision on
the matter, unless any pending litigation, disputes or negotiations involving
the county exist regarding the BESS, in which case any amounts owed to the
applicant shall be refunded within six months of the conclusion of the
litigation, disputes or negotiations. An applicant may request any unused
application fee be applied toward building permit fees for the facility.
   (B)   Building permit fees. Building permit fees shall be based on the total
construction cost of the BESS project. Prior to the issuance of a building
permit, applicant must deposit a building permit fee equating to $7.50 per
$1,000 of construction cost. With its building permit application, applicant
must provide to the County Zoning Administrator an affidavit showing the total
construction cost. If requested, an itemized affidavit of construction costs
shall also be provided to the County Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Operating permit fees. Applicant shall pay to the county an operating
permit fee of $2,500 per megawatt (MW). If the total nameplate capacity is
below one MW, the operating permit fee shall be reduced pro rata based on
kilowatt (kW) capacity. Applicant or owner/operator shall not begin commercial
operation until such time as the operating permit fee has been paid. If the
owner/operator of the BESS changes, a new operating permit fee shall be paid to
the county for the county’s evaluation of ownership or operator.
   (D)   All costs paid by applicant/owner. In addition to all fees noted
above, the applicant or owner shall pay all costs incurred by the county,
including but not limited to, those costs associated with all offices, boards
and commissions of the county, and third-party costs incurred by the county.
This includes, but is not limited to, the direct or indirect costs associated
with the hearing, permitting, operations, inspections, decommissioning,
litigation, disputes, and/or negotiations.
(Ord. O-157-03-25, passed 3-13-2025)
§ 157.15 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES.
   (A)   Any BESS declared to be unsafe by the county by reason of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, damage, or abandonment is
hereby declared a public safety issue and shall be abated by repair,
rehabilitation, demolition, or removal in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Failure by the applicant, owner, or operator to comply with any
provisions of this chapter, provisions under the special use permit, other
permits, any conditions imposed on the project, and/or failure to comply with
any law or regulation shall constitute a default under this chapter and shall
be grounds for revocation of any special use permit or other permits granted by
the County Board or the county.
   (C)   Prior to implementation of the existing county procedures for the
resolution of such default(s), the appropriate county body shall first provide
written notice to the owner and operator, setting forth the alleged default(s).
The written notice shall provide the owner and operator a reasonable time
period, not to exceed 30 days, for good faith negotiations to resolve the
alleged default(s).
   (D)   If the county determines that the parties cannot resolve the alleged
defaults within the good faith negotiation period, the county shall make
application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with
this chapter or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure
compliance with this chapter.
   (E)   Any violation of this chapter shall be an offense punishable by a fine
of $1,000. Each violation shall be a separate offense. Each day a violation
occurs or continues shall be a separate offense, subject to a $1,000 fine for
each additional day the violation is not corrected. A court may set any
additional and appropriate per day fine for each day the infraction exists or
until such infraction is remedied. It is the goal of this chapter to promote
structural safety to protect the public. The court has the authority to set any
additional appropriate fines and will consider the nature of the offense, the
degree of public safety involved, and the efforts of the county and responsible
owner or applicant to resolve quickly and safely any and all infractions. It is
the intent that any dispute between the parties be resolved promptly and where
possible by informal discussions as outlined elsewhere in this chapter.
   (F)   After the effective date of this chapter, any persons who, being the
owner or agent of the owner of any land, or project developer, located within
the territorial jurisdiction of this chapter, thereafter, proceeds with
development of a BESS prior to being approved under the terms of this chapter
shall be fined as stated herein.
   (G)   The county reserves the right to hire outside counsel to enforce this
chapter or determine compliance with this chapter. The owner/operator is liable
for payment of reasonable attorney’s fees in this regard.
   (H)   Nothing herein shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the applicant, owner, or operator responsible for the project.
(Ord. O-157-03-25, passed 3-13-2025)
§ 157.16 INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be held to the minimum requirements
adopted for the promotion and preservation of public health, safety, and
general welfare of the county. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate, annual, or in any manner interfere with existing regulations or laws
of the county nor conflict with and laws of the State of Illinois.
