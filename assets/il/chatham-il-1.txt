the corporate authorities may enact an Ordinance adopting such revisions;
   WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 1-2-3 of the Illinois Municipal Code, the
Village retained the services of American Legal Publishing to revise the
Village's Ordinances, and American Legal Publishing Corporation, after

   SECTION 1: The book of revised ordinances entitled "Village of Chatham Code
of Ordinances" prepared by American Legal Publishing Corporation, is hereby
adopted and enacted, and shall be treated and considered as a new and original
comprehensive ordinance which shall supersede all other general and permanent
ordinances passed by the President and Board of Trustees on or before June 24,
1997. Said book shall be known as the "Chatham Code of Ordinances".
   SECTION 2: All general ordinances of the Village of Chatham enacted prior to
June 24, 1997, are hereby repealed, except such as are included in the Chatham
Code of Ordinances or are by necessary implication reserved from repeal
(subject to the saving clauses contained in the following sections), and
excluding the following ordinances, which are not hereby repealed: tax levy
ordinances; appropriation ordinances; ordinances relating to boundaries and

§ 30.06 CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS.
   The following rules shall govern citizen participation in meetings.
   (A)   The Village recognizes the Illinois Open Meetings Act provides that
any person shall be permitted an opportunity to address public officials under
rules established by the village. The Village Board, by majority vote of its
members then holding office, may suspend the public comment rules herein
established as deemed prudent and in accordance with the law. These rules shall
apply to all committees, commissions and other subsidiary bodies of the Village
Board unless otherwise noted and specific to the Village Board.
   (B)   Persons desiring to be recognized and speak at open meetings of the
Village Board or other public bodies of the village are encouraged, but are not
required, to notify the Village Board or other public body at least one working
day prior to the meeting of the subject matter upon which they wish to speak so
that the village and its staff can better respond to the person’s concerns.
However, anyone desiring to address the Village Board must sign the public
comment sheet prior to the start of the meeting. The speaker must include their
name, agenda topic/village concern, and optionally any contact information that
they desire to provide. Although not required, speakers are encouraged to
provide contact information so that the village can be more responsive,
including following up on concerns or questions raised.
   (C)   There shall be two opportunities for the public to address the Village
Board during Village Board meetings. The first public comments period, "Public
Comment on Agenda Topics" shall follow Roll Call and shall be directed to
specific agenda topics. The second public comment period, "Public Comment on
Village Business" shall immediately precede meeting adjournment, and will
include general comments not specific to agenda topics or any further comments
not spoken in the first public comment period. Speakers are encouraged not to
be duplicative in remarks that are made. Nothing within this section shall
limit the ability of the Village Board, by majority vote, to change the
placement of the public comment periods on a specific agenda. Each public
comment period shall be limited to 30 minutes in time, unless that time is
extended at the discretion of the Village President or other presiding officer.
Each person shall have the floor for a maximum of five minutes unless that time
is extended at the discretion of the Village President or other presiding
officer.
   (D)   The Village Agenda shall contain an agenda topic entitled "Public
Announcements". Speakers wishing to speak during the first public comments
period under this topic may address the board on Public Announcements. For
purposes of this section, PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS shall mean a statement intended
to address the public at large about the details (time, place, etc.) of a
village event, plan, or other upcoming village affair.
   (E)   Persons addressing the Village Board or other public body of the
village shall be recognized at the time set forth on the agenda for the
meeting.
   (F)   Persons shall be recognized and called to address the public body by
name, in the order they signed in, by the Village President or other officer
presiding at the meeting. Any person who signed in to speak during the "Public
Comment on Agenda Topics" portion of a Village Board meeting that does not get
to speak during time, shall automatically have their name added to the list of
individuals desiring to speak at the "Public Comment on Village Business”
comment period at the end of the meeting. Each person shall have the floor for
a maximum of five minutes unless that time is extended at the discretion of the
Village President or other presiding officer.
   (G)   After the speaker is recognized by the Village President or other
presiding officer by name, said speaker will approach the designated area, the
Central Citizen Podium, to address the Village Board. The speaker shall begin
their statement by stating their name for the record.
   (H)   Public comment is not intended to require public officials to provide
any answers to the speaker.
   (I)   Discussions between speakers and members of the audience will not be
allowed.
   (J)   If a group of persons share a particular concern, the group will be
encouraged, but not required, to appoint one or more spokespersons to speak on
behalf of the group.
   (K)   The Village President or other presiding officer may in his or her
discretion limit a person’s remark below the five minutes provided in division
(C) or (E) of this section if the person’s remarks are cumulative or
duplicative of remarks already made by some other person.
   (L)   Persons addressing the Village Board or other public body of the
village shall do so with proper decorum and shall not engage in disorderly or
threatening behavior. Any person who disrupts the order and decorum of the
meeting may be removed.
   (M)   Presentations to the Village Board shall be limited to a person’s
business with the village or concerns regarding village business, property,
personnel or operations. The Village President or other presiding officer may
terminate any presentation that is unrelated to the business, property,
personnel or operations of the village.
   (N)   Presentations to any public body other than the Village Board shall be
limited to matters under the jurisdiction of such public body. The presiding
officer may terminate any presentation which includes matters not under the
jurisdiction of the public body.
   (O)   These rules are not a limit on the Village President’s or other
presiding officer’s authority to expel persons who have breached the peace at a
meeting.
   (P)   These rules are applicable to all boards, commissions, committees, and
other political subdivisions established by the Village Board and subject to
the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
(Ord. 11-10, passed 3-8-11; Am. Ord. 17-24, passed 6-13-17)
§ 30.07 REMOTE ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS.
   (A)   Rules statement. Any member of the Village Board may attend any open
or closed meeting of the Village Board via electronic means (such as by
telephone, video or internet connection), provided that such attendance is not
otherwise prohibited and is in compliance with these rules and any applicable
laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Village Board may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The member must notify the Clerk at least 24 hours before the
meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can be
arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result in
denial of a request for remote attendance.
      (2)   The member must assert one of the following three reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the Village Board; or
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency.
   (C)   Authorization to participate. After receiving the electronic
attendance request, the Clerk shall inform the Village Board of the request for
electronic attendance. After establishing that there is a quorum physically
present at a meeting where a member of the Village Board desires to attend
electronically, the presiding officer shall state that (i) a notice was
received by a member of the Village Board in accordance with these rules; and
(ii) the member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting electronically,
unless a motion objecting to the member’s electronic attendance is made,
seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the members of the Village Board
physically present at the meeting. If no such motion is made and seconded or if
any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by the members of the
Village Board physically present at the meeting, then the request by the member
to attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed approved by the Village
Board and the presiding officer shall declare the requesting member present.
After such declaration by the presiding officer, the question of a member’s
electronic attendance may not be reconsidered.
   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically
and other members of the Village Board must be able to communicate effectively,
and members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the
meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the Village
Board shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the
meeting site.
   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic
means.
   (F)   Rights of a remote member. A member permitted to attend electronically
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all

      (5)   Questions of parliamentary law at the meetings of the Board shall
be addressed as provided below. To the extent not provided for in these rules,
and to the extent it does not conflict with Illinois law, Village ordinances,
or with the spirit of these rules, the Board shall refer to Robert's Rules of
Order Newly Revised, and specifically the rules for small boards, to answer
unresolved procedural questions.
         (a)   Substantive motion. A substantive motion may deal with any
subject within the Board's legal powers, duties and responsibilities. A
substantive motion is out of order while another substantive motion is pending.
         (b)   Procedural motion. The following enumeration of procedural
motions are in order. Unless otherwise noted each motion is debatable, may be
amended, and requires a majority of the votes cast, a quorum being present, for
adoption. Procedural motions are in order while a substantive motion is
pending. The following is an exhaustive list; if a procedural motion is not on
the list, then it is not available. In order of priority, if applicable, the
procedural motions are:
            1.   Motion to appeal a procedural ruling of the chairperson. A
decision of the Chairperson ruling a motion in or out of order, entertaining
and answering a question of parliamentary law or procedure may be appealed to
the Board. This appeal is in order immediately after such decision is announced
and at no other time. The Board member making the motion need not be recognized
by the Chairperson and the motion, if timely made, may not be ruled out of
order. If the appeal is seconded, the Board member making the appeal may
briefly explain the ruling, but there shall be no debate on the appeal, and no
other Board member shall participate in the discussion. The Chairperson shall
then put the question, "Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained?" If a
majority of the members present vote "Aye," the ruling of the Chair is
sustained; otherwise, it is overruled.
            2.   Motion to adjourn. This motion may be made only at the
conclusion of action on a pending substantive matter; it may not interrupt
deliberation of a pending matter. This motion, if passed, requires the Board to
immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting. A motion to
adjourn shall always be in order, except:
               A.   When a Board member is in possession of the floor;
               B.   When the Board members are voting;
               C.   When adjournment was the last preceding motion; and
               D.   When it has been decided that the previous question shall
be taken.
            3.   Motion to recess. Board members may propose a brief recess
during its proceedings. This motion, if passed, requires the Board to
immediately take a recess. Normally, the Chairperson determines the length of
the recess, which may range from a few minutes to an hour.
            4.   Motion to call to follow the agenda. This motion, if passed,
requires the Board to conform to its agenda or order of business. This motion
must be made at the first reasonable opportunity (when the item of business
that deviates from the agenda is proposed) or the right to make it is waived
for the out-of-order item in question.
            5.   Motion to suspend rules. This motion, if passed, allows the
body to suspend its own rules of order, conduct or procedure for a particular
purpose. The motion should specifically state the portion of the rules that are
being suspended. This motion requires a two-thirds vote. This motion must be
specific and state the reason for suspending the rules.
            6.   Motion to go into closed session (executive session). The
Board may go into closed session only for one or more of the permissible
purposes listed under Section 2 of the Illinois Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/
1). The motion to go into closed session shall cite one or more of these
purposes and shall be adopted at an open meeting.
            7.   Motion to leave closed session (executive session). This
motion provides a procedural mechanism for returning from closed session to an
open meeting.
            8.   Motion to divide a complex motion (question) and consider it
by paragraph. This motion is in order whenever a Board member wishes to
consider and vote on subparts of a complex motion separately.
            9.   Motion to defer consideration (table). The Board may defer a
substantive motion for later consideration at an unspecified time. A
substantive motion, the consideration of which has been deferred, expires 100
days thereafter unless a motion to revive consideration is adopted. If
consideration of a motion has been deferred, a new motion with the same effect
cannot be introduced while the deferred motion remains pending. A Board member
who wishes to revisit the matter during that time must take action to revive
consideration of the original motion, or else move to suspend the rules.
            10.   Motion to move the previous question (limit debate). This
motion may be made at any time after a substantive motion is made and a minimum
of ten minutes of debate time has passed. If made after ten minutes but before
20 minutes of debate, each Board member shall have up to two minutes to give a
final statement; and, after each Board member has been given an opportunity to
give his/her final statement, the motion requires a two-thirds vote. If made
after at least 20 minutes of debate, upon the motion, each Board member shall
have up to two minutes to give a final statement; and, after each Board member
has been given an opportunity to give his/her final statement, the motion
requires a majority vote.
            11.   Motion to postpone to a certain time or day. This motion
allows the Board to postpone consideration of an item to a specified day. If
consideration of a motion has been postponed, a new motion with the same effect
cannot be introduced while the postponed motion remains pending. A Board member
who wishes to revisit the matter must either wait until the specified time, or
move to suspend the rules.
            12.   Motion to amend. An amendment to a motion must be pertinent
to the subject matter of the motion. An amendment is improper if adoption of
the motion with that amendment added would have the same effect as rejection of
the original motion. A proposal to substitute completely different wording for
a motion or an amendment shall be treated as a motion to amend. A motion maybe
amended, and that amendment may be amended, but no further amendments may be
made until the last offered amendment is disposed of by a vote.
            13.   Motion to revive consideration. The Board may vote to revive
consideration of any substantive motion earlier deferred by adoption of a
motion to defer consideration (table). The motion is in order at any time
within 100 days after the day of a vote to defer consideration. A substantive
motion on which consideration has been deferred expires 100 days after the
deferral unless a motion to revive consideration is adopted.
            14.   Motion to reconsider.
               A.   The Board may vote to reconsider its action on a matter.
The motion to do so must be made by a member who voted with the prevailing side
(the majority) and:
                  i.   At the meeting during which the original vote was taken,
including any continuation of that meeting through recess or adjournment to a
time and place certain; or
                  ii.   At the next regularly scheduled Board meeting following
the meeting during which the original vote was taken.
               B.   The motion cannot interrupt deliberation on a pending
matter but is in order at any time before final adjournment of the meeting.
            15.   Motion to rescind or repeal. The Board may vote to rescind
actions it has previously taken or to repeal items that it has previously
adopted. This motion is used at a later meeting and has the purpose of
canceling the action the Board took at a previous meeting. This motion can be
made by any Board member, no matter how he or she voted on the original motion.
The motion requires a majority vote if a Board member provides notice to the
Board, prior to the meeting, that the motion will be made, or a two-thirds vote
if such notice is not provided.
            16.   Motion to prevent reintroduction for six months. This motion
shall be in order immediately following the defeat of a substantive motion and
at no other time, The motion requires, for adoption, a two-thirds vote. If
adopted, the restriction imposed by the motion remains in effect for six
months.
   (B)   These rules may be amended at any regular meeting or at any properly
called special meeting that includes amendment of the rules as one of the
stated purposes of the meeting, so long as the amendment is consistent with
generally accepted principles of parliamentary procedure.
   (C)   The failure to strictly adhere to these rules shall not invalidate any
action taken at a properly noticed meeting.

(Ord. 01-45, passed 8-14-01)
§ 33.63 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The following rules shall govern the Veterans Memorial and Veterans Memorial
Commission:
   (A)   The Veterans Memorial is intended to honor veterans and veterans
organizations through the placement of memorial bricks in the Memorial. Only
veterans who served in the Armed Forces of the United States of America
(including reserves and National Guard), and bona fide veterans organizations
of the United States of America, will be allowed bricks in the Memorial. If
there is a question as to the authenticity of a veterans organization, the
Memorial Commission shall consult with the local American Legion and VFW Post
before rendering a decision on eligibility.
   (B)   Each person or organization desiring a brick shall submit an
application on a form designed by the Memorial Commission. The Memorial
Commission shall determine the applicant’s eligibility with these rules, and
shall accept or reject the application based thereon. If an application is
accepted, the Memorial Commission will notify the applicant, and upon the
applicant’s payment of $50, the Memorial Commission will order the brick.
   (C)   Each brick shall contain the name of the veterans organization or the
name of the veteran. No ranks or insignia will be allowed in the Veterans
Memorial, however, a brick may designate the veterans’ unit (e.g., 33rd
Infantry Division) or ship (e.g., USS Dwight D. Eisenhower). If there is a
question as to unit or ship, the Memorial Commission shall consult with the
local American Legion and VFW Post before rendering a decision on eligibility.
   (D)   A veteran need not a resident of the village to qualify for the
Veterans Memorial. The general policy is to be inclusive rather than exclusive
for determining names on the Veteran’s Memorial. Only one name may appear on
each brick; family bricks are not allowed. However, the Memorial Commission
will make reasonable efforts to group family members and friends upon their
request.
   (E)   To qualify for a brick, an individual must hold an honorable discharge
or a discharge under honorable conditions. If an individual has served more
than one enlistment or in more than one branch of service, then the Memorial
Commission will consider the most recent discharge for purposes of this rule.
If after a brick is ordered, an individual is discovered to have had a less
than honorable discharge or has otherwise materially misrepresented his or her
service in the application, the Memorial Commission may refuse to place the
brick in the Memorial, and may remove any bricks already placed in the
Memorial. There will be no refunds in such event.
   (F)   The Commission may add bricks to the Memorial at such times as it
determines in its sole discretion. A minimum of 50 memorial bricks will be
added at a time to the Memorial.
   (G)   Bricks will be of uniform size, design, color and engraving style.
Arnold Monument has supplied all bricks prior to enactment of these rules;
their bricks are acceptable.
   (H)   The Chatham American Legion and VFW Posts may, without further
permission from the Memorial Commission, conduct joint Memorial Day services at
the Veterans Memorial. Other bona fide veterans groups and individuals may
conduct services at the Veterans Memorial on a first-come, first-serve basis by
making application in advance to the Memorial Commission.
   (I)   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Veterans Memorial Commission
under these rules may appeal to the Village President, who shall conduct an
informal hearing and render a decision within seven working days of receipt of
the appeal.

   The Entertainment Board shall have the duty of promoting, coordinating and
scheduling musical and cultural entertainment in the Village Parks. Scheduling
of such events shall be coordinated with the Village Recreation Commission, the

require payment, the Board may work with individuals, groups and companies,
both for-profit and not-for-profit, to arrange for financial sponsorship of

regarding the use of Village Parks for entertainment and cultural events for

§ 35.077 UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   Occasionally, for medical, personal, or other reasons, an employee may need
to be temporarily released from the duties of his or her job with the village,
but may not wish to submit his or her resignation. Under certain circumstances,
an employee may be eligible for an unpaid leave of absence. There are several
types of unpaid leaves which the employee may be eligible for:
   (A)   Family/medical leave of absence. In general, a leave of absence is an
official authorization to be absent from work without pay for a specified
period of time. Eligible employees may be entitled to job-protected family or
medical leaves of absence if they are unable to come to work due to pressing
family or medical concerns as described under the following family/medical
leave policy, which shall be administered in accordance with applicable state
and federal laws:
      (1)   Employees are eligible if they have been actively employed for 12
months and worked at least 1,250 hours (an average of 25 hours per week) during
those 12 months.
      (2)   Under the circumstances set forth below, each eligible employee
shall have up to a total of 12 weeks leave during any one year period.
      (3)   A family leave shall be granted upon the birth or adoption of a
child of the employee, or upon the serious illness of the employee’s child,
spouse or parent.
      (4)   A medical leave shall be granted upon the employee’s own serious
illness.
      (5)   Whenever possible, and subject to the employee’s health care
provider’s approval, absences for planned medical treatment should be scheduled
so as not to unduly disrupt village operations.
      (6)   In appropriate circumstances, the village may require the employee
to be examined by a village designated physician, at village expense.
      (7)   In the event of serious illness to the employee or his or her
child, spouse or parent, creating a need for unforeseeable family or medical
leave, the employee should provide the Director notice, as soon as practicable,
of any time needed off, and a written doctor’s certificate indicating the
expected duration and nature of the illness, particularly as it relates to the
employee’s ability to come to work or the need for that employee’s presence at
home to care for a seriously ill family member.
      (8)   Employee’s shall be required to give 30 days advance notice in the
event of a foreseeable medical treatment. To assist the village in arranging
work assignments during the employee’s absence, the village asks that the
employee give the village prior notice, to the extent possible, of an expected
birth or adoption, as well as an indication, to the extent known, of the
employee’s expected return date. To facilitate the employee’s return to work,
the village also asks that the employee provide the village with two weeks
advance notification of the employee’s intended return date. Failure to do so
may delay the employee’s return date.
      (9)   For purposes of this policy, a child is defined as a natural,
adopted, or foster child, a stepchild or a legal ward. If the child is over 18
he or she must be unable to care for himself or herself due to a serious
illness.
      (10)   A parent is defined as the employee's or his or her spouse's
natural, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian.
      (11)   A serious illness is defined as a disabling physical or mental
illness, injury, impairment, or condition involving: (1) inpatient care in a
hospital, nursing home, or hospice; or (2) outpatient care requiring continuing
treatment or supervision from a health care professional.
      (12)   Leave of absence rights available to the employee under other
sections of the village’s policy shall be counted towards the total time off
available under this section.
      (13)   Upon completion of a leave granted under this section, the
employee shall be reinstated to his or her original position, or an equivalent
one.
      (14)   If, due to the employee’s own medical circumstances, the employee
is no longer able to perform his or her original job, the village will attempt
to transfer the employee to alternate suitable work, if available.
      (15)   While on a leave of absence provided for under this policy, the
village will continue the employee’s group health insurance benefits under the
same terms as provided to other employees, for up to a maximum of 12 weeks
leave time during any one year period. If the employee’s leave extends beyond
12 weeks, the employee shall be offered the opportunity to purchase continuing
coverage under state and federal COBRA continuation rules.
      (16)   Other accumulated fringe benefits such as seniority, retirement,
service credits, sick pay, vacation pay, and the like, shall be preserved at
the level earned as of commencement of the leave, but shall not accrue further
during any such leave period.
      (17)   Should the employee require an extended leave beyond the period of
time described in this policy, the village will seek to return the employee to
a suitable position, but cannot guarantee that one will be available.
   (B)   Disability (including pregnancy) leave of absence. Medical
documentation, to the satisfaction of the village may be required for all
periods of time during short-term disability. The village reserves the right to
require independent medical verification of an employee's inability to work,
based on a medical exam by a physician chosen by and paid for by the village.
      (1)   The village classifies pregnancy as any other medically disabling
condition, and will provide reasonable leave for all employees for the period
of disability as determined by the employee and her physician. When ready to
return to work, the employee will be reinstated to her original job or a
similar level position providing circumstances have not so changed as to make
it impossible or unreasonable to do so. At all times the village’s maternity
leave policy will be in compliance with the state and federal laws.
      (2)   Extended maternity leave. Should an employee with an excellent work
record desire more time after using all vacation and sick time, allowances may
be made at the discretion of the Director and on an individual basis. The
deciding factor will be the ability of the village to cover, without
interruption, the position as described in the employee's job description.
      (3)   Extended disability leave. If the employee’s disability, (other
than pregnancy), prevents the employee from working for longer than six weeks,
when the employee is ready to return to work the village will do its best to
reinstate the employee to his or her position or a similar position, but the
village cannot guarantee that the employee’s job or any job will be available.
   (C)   Educational leave of absence. An educational leave of absence may be
approved if the desired curriculum is of mutual benefit to the employee and to
the village. Apply in the same manner as the employee would for a personal
leave of absence.
   (D)   Election day. The village encourages the employee to exercise his or
her voting privileges in local, state, and national elections. However, since
the polls are open for long periods, the employee is encouraged to vote before
or after regular working hours. If it should be necessary, the employee may
take up to thirty minutes leave from work to vote in a governmental election or
referendum. The employee will be expected to notify his or her department head
at least one week in advance. The employee will not be paid for such time.
Personal leave time, if available, may be used for this purpose.
   (E)   Military leave of absence. If the employee is a full-time employee and
is inducted into the U.S. Armed Forces, the employee will be eligible for re-
employment after completing military service, provided:
      (1)   The employee show his or her orders to the Director as soon as the
employee receives them.
      (2)   The employee satisfactorily completes his or her active duty
service.
      (3)   The employee enters the military service directly from his or her
employment with the village.
      (4)   The employee applies for and is available for re-employment within
90 days after discharge from active duty. If the employee is returning from up
to six months active duty for training, the employee must apply within a
reasonable time (usually 30 days) after discharge.
   (F)   Military reserves or National Guard leave of absence. Employees who
serve in U. S. military organizations or state militia groups may take the
necessary time off without pay to fulfill this obligation, and will retain all
of their legal rights for continued employment under existing laws. These
employees may apply accrued personal leave and unused earned vacation time to
the leave if they wish; however, they are not obliged to do so. The employee is
expected to notify the Director as soon as the employee is aware of the dates
he or she will be on duty so that arrangements can be made for replacement
during this absence.
   (G)   Personal leave of absence. In very special circumstances, the village
may grant a leave for a personal reason, but never for taking employment
elsewhere or going into business for one’s self. The employee should request an
unpaid personal leave of absence from the Director. A personal leave of absence
must not interfere with the operations of the employee’s department or the
village. A personal leave of absence may be granted for up to 30 days. If the
employee’s leave is extended for more than 30 days, vacation and other benefits
will no longer continue to accrue. Consult employee group insurance booklet to
determine employee insurance coverage during a leave of absence. Failure to
return from a leave at the time agreed will result in termination of
employment.
   (H)   Accepting other employment or going into business while on leave of
absence. If an employee accepts any employment or goes into business while on a
leave of absence from the village, the employee will be considered to have
voluntarily resigned from employment with the village as of the day on which
the employee began his or her leave of absence.
   (I)   Insurance premium payment during leaves of absence. While the employee
is on unpaid leave of absence from the village, the employee will be
responsible for paying the total premiums for his or her coverage and that of
his or her dependents while on leave. Failure to do so may result in loss of
coverage and possible refusal by the insurance carrier to allow the employee’s
coverage to be reinstated.
   (J)   Jury leave. An employee called for jury duty shall be given leave to
attend jury duty. The employee upon receiving a summons shall immediately
provide a copy to his or her department head, or if the employee is a
department head, to the Director of Administration. An employee taking jury
leave has the following options regarding pay:
      (1)   The employee may continue to receive pay from the village and pay
over to the Village Treasurer all compensation paid by the court;

(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)

   (A)   All requests for inspection or copying of public records shall be in
writing and shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer. The requestor shall include
the following information in any request for public records:
      (1)   The requestor's full name, mailing address and telephone number at
which the requestor can be reached during normal business hours;
      (2)   A description of the records sought, as specific as possible;
      (3)   An indication of whether the records are requested for a commercial
purpose and whether the requestor seeks a fee waiver; and
      (4)   A statement as to whether the request is for inspection, copying,
or both.
   (B)   The FOIA Officer shall make available a form for use by requestors;
however, no request shall be denied for failure to use the form. All requests
for inspection and copying received by the village shall immediately be

(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.46 FEES.
   (A)   The village hereby establishes and shall charge fees reasonably
calculated to reimburse its actual cost for reproducing and certifying public
records and for the use, by any person, of the equipment of the village to copy
records. Such fees exclude the costs of any search for and review of the
record, and shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction and certification,
unless otherwise provided by state statute. The charge for copying shall be
$.10 per page for photocopies, $.05 per page for computer printouts, and $2.50
per audio tape, CD, or DVD. No fees shall be charged for the first 50 pages of
black and white, letter or legal sized copies requested by a requestor. If the
village provides copies in color or in a size other than letter or legal, it
shall charge the actual cost for reproducing the records. In calculating the
actual cost for reproducing records or for the use of the equipment of the
village to reproduce the records, the village shall not include the costs of
any search for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated
with reproducing the records. The cost for certifying a record shall be $1.
   (B)   Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
where the village determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because furnishing information can be considered as primarily
benefitting the general public. Waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate
information regarding the health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the
general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or commercial
benefit. For purposes of this section, "commercial benefit" shall not apply to
requests made by news media when the principal purpose of the request is to
access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and welfare or
the legal rights of the general public. In setting the amount of the waiver or
reduction, the village may take into consideration the amount of materials
requested and the cost of copying them.
(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.47 TIME LIMIT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REQUEST.
   (A)   Compliance with request (non-commercial purpose).  The village shall
either comply with or deny a request for public records within five business
days after its receipt. If the village fails to respond to a request within the
requisite periods in this section but thereafter provides the requester with
copies of the requested public records may not impose a fee for such copies. If
the village fails to respond to a request received may not treat the request as
unduly burdensome under §
36.49. Denials shall be in writing and in accordance with §
36.51.
   (B)   Compliance with request (commercial purpose). The village shall
respond to a request for records to be used for a commercial purpose within 21
working days after receipt. The response shall:
      (1)   Provide to the requestor an estimate of the time required by the
village to provide the records requested and an estimate of the fees to be
charged, which the village may require the person to pay in full before copying
the requested documents;
      (2)   Deny the request pursuant to one or more of the exemptions set out
in this subchapter;
      (3)   Notify the requestor that the request is unduly burdensome and
extend an opportunity to the requestor to attempt to reduce the request to
manageable proportions; or
      (4)   Provide the records requested.
   (C)   Unless the records are exempt from disclosure (see Appendix A to this
subchapter), the village shall comply with a request within a reasonable period
considering the size and complexity of the request, and giving priority to
records requested for non-commercial purposes. No person shall knowingly obtain
a public record for a commercial purpose without disclosing that it is for a
commercial purpose, if requested to do so by the village.
(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.48 EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT (NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSE); NOTICE.
   (A)   The time limit prescribed in §
36.47(A) may be extended in each case for not more than five additional
business days from the original due date for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other
locations other than the office having charge of the requested records.
      (2)   The request requires the collection of a substantial number of
specified records.
      (3)   The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an
extensive search for the records responsive to it.
      (4)   The requested records have not been located in the course of
routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them.
      (5)   The requested records require examination and evaluation by
personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they
are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions.
      (6)   The request for records cannot be complied with by the village
within the time limits prescribed by the foregoing paragraph without unduly
burdening or interfering with the operations of the village.
      (7)   There is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all
practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of
a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the
subject matter of the request.
   (B)   The person making a request and the village may agree in writing to
extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties. If
the requestor and the village agree to extend the period for compliance, a
failure by the village to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be
treated as a denial of the request for the records.
   (C)   When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the
FOIA Officer shall notify the person making the request, by letter, within the
five business days after receipt of the request, of the reasons for the delay
and the date by which the records will be made available or denial will be
forthcoming. In no instance may the delay in processing last longer than five
business days. A failure to render a decision within the time permitted for
extension shall be considered a denial of the request.
   (D)   If the village fails to respond to a request within the time permitted
for extension but thereafter provides the requestor with copies of the
requested public records, the village may not impose a fee for those copies. If
the village requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond to the
request, it may not treat the request as unduly burdensome under §
36.49.
(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.49 UNDULY BURDENSOME REQUESTS.
   (A)   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the village, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on the
village strongly outweighs the public interest in the information. Before
invoking this exemption, the village shall extend to the person making the
request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to
manageable proportions. If the village responds to a categorical request by
stating that compliance would unduly burden its operation and the conditions
described above are met, it shall do so in a writing signed by the FOIA Officer
specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to
which compliance will so burden the operation of the village. Such a response
shall be treated as a denial of the request for information.
   (B)   Repeated requests for the same public records by the same person shall
be deemed unduly burdensome. Repeated requests from the same person for the
same records that are unchanged or identical to records previously provided or
properly denied under this subchapter shall be deemed unduly burdensome.
(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.50 CERTAIN INFORMATION EXEMPT FROM INSPECTION AND COPYING.
   (A)   Information exempted by Sections 7 and 7.5 of the Freedom of
Information Act shall be exempt from inspection and copying (see Appendix A to
this subchapter). If a record contains both exempt and nonexempt information,
the village may elect to redact the information that is exempt and make the
remainder of the record available for inspection and copying.
   (B)   Moreover, information described in divisions (1) through (4) of the
definition for "Public Record" may be withheld if it is determined that
disclosure would: (1) interfere with pending or actually and reasonably
contemplated law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement
agency; (2) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement or
correctional personnel or any other person; or (3) compromise the security of
any correctional facility.
(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.51 NOTICE OF DENIAL OF REQUEST; REQUEST FOR REVIEW.
   (A)   The FOIA Officer, when denying a request for public record, shall
notify the requestor, by letter, of the decision to deny the information, the
reason for the denial, including a detailed factual basis for the application
of any exemption claimed, and the names and titles or positions of each person
responsible for the denial.
   (B)   Each notice of denial by the FOIA Officer shall inform the person of
the right to review by the Public Access Counselor and provide the address and
phone number for the Public Access Counselor.
   (C)   Each notice of denial shall also inform such person of his or her
right to judicial review in accordance with Section 11 of the Freedom of
Information Act.
   (D)   When a request is denied on the grounds that the records are exempt
under the provisions of this subchapter, the notice of denial shall specify the
exemption claimed to authorize the denial and briefly explain how the exemption
applies to the specified records withheld.
   (E)   Copies of all notices of denials shall be retained by the village in a
single central office file that is open to the public and indexed according to
the type of exemption asserted and, to the extent feasible, according to the
types of records requested.
   (F)   Any person making a request for public records shall be deemed to have
exhausted his or her administrative remedies with respect to that request if
the village fails to act within the time periods provided in §
36.47 and §
36.48.
(Ord. 10-02, passed 1-12-10)
§ 36.52 PUBLIC ACCESS COUNSELOR; OPINIONS.
   (A)   A person whose request to inspect or copy a public record is denied by
the village may file a request for review with the Public Access Counselor
established in the Office of the Attorney General not later than 60 days after
the date of the final denial. The request for review must be in writing, signed
by the requester, and include (1) a copy of the request for access to records
and (2) any responses from the public body.
   (B)   If the village receives a request for records, and asserts that the
records are exempt under general exemptions (1)(C) or (1)(F) (see Appendix A of
this subchapter), it shall, within the time periods provided for responding to
a request, provide written notice to the requester and the Public Access
Counselor of its intent to deny the request in whole or in part. The notice
shall include:
      (1)   A copy of the request for access to records;
      (2)   The proposed response from the public body; and
      (3)   A detailed summary of the public body's basis for asserting the
exemption.
   (C)   In accordance with FOIA, upon receipt of a notice of intent to deny
from the village, the Public Access Counselor determines whether further
inquiry is warranted. Within five working days after receipt of the notice of
intent to deny, the Public Access Counselor notifies the village and the
requester whether further inquiry is warranted. If the Public Access Counselor
determines that further inquiry is warranted, the procedures set out in this
section regarding the review of denials, including the production of documents,
shall also be applicable to the inquiry and resolution of a notice of intent to
deny from the village. Times for response or compliance by the village under §
36.47 and §
36.48 shall be tolled until the Public Access Counselor concludes his or her
inquiry.
   (D)   In accordance with FOIA, upon receipt of a request for review, the
Public Access Counselor determines whether further action is warranted. If the
Public Access Counselor determines that the alleged violation is unfounded, he
or she so advises the requester and the village and no further action shall be
undertaken. In all other cases, the Public Access Counselor forwards a copy of
the request for review to the village within seven working days after receipt
and specifies the records or other documents that the village shall furnish to
facilitate the review. Within seven working days after receipt of the request
for review, the FOIA Officer shall provide copies of records requested and
shall otherwise fully cooperate with the Public Access Counselor. If the FOIA
Officer fails to furnish specified records pursuant to this section, or if
otherwise necessary, the Attorney General may issue a subpoena to any person or
public body having knowledge of or records pertaining to a request for review
of a denial of access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. By
statute, to the extent that records or documents produced by the village
contain information that is claimed to be exempt from disclosure under Appendix
A of this subchapter, the Public Access Counselor does not further disclose
that information.
   (E)   In accordance with FOIA, within seven working days after it receives a
copy of a request for review and request for production of records from the
Public Access Counselor, the FOIA Officer may, but is not required to, answer
the allegations of the request for review. The answer may take the form of a
letter, brief, or memorandum. The Public Access Counselor forwards a copy of
the answer to the person submitting the request for review, with any alleged
confidential information to which the request pertains redacted from the copy.
The requester may, but is not required to, respond in writing to the answer
within seven working days and shall provide a copy of the response to the
village, in addition to the request for review, and the answer and the response
thereto, if any, a requester or the village may furnish affidavits or records
concerning any matter germane to the review.
   (F)   (1)   In accordance with FOIA, unless the Public Access Counselor
extends the time by no more than 21 business days by sending written notice to
the requester and the village that includes a statement of the reasons for the
extension in the notice, or decides to address the matter without the issuance
of a binding opinion, the Attorney General examines the issues and the records,
makes findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issues to the requester and
the village an opinion in response to the request for review within 60 days
after its receipt. The opinion is binding upon both the requester and the
village, subject to administrative review under Section 11.5 of the Freedom of
Information Act [5 ILCS 140/11.5].
      (2)   Upon receipt of a binding opinion concluding that a violation of
FOIA has occurred, the FOIA Officer shall either take necessary action
immediately to comply with the directive of the opinion or shall initiate
administrative review under Section 11.5 of FOIA. If the opinion concludes that
no violation of FOIA has occurred, the requester may initiate administrative
review under Section 11.5 of FOIA. If the village discloses records in
accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General, it is immune from all
liabilities by reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under FOIA.
   (G)   In accordance with FOIA, the Attorney General may also issue advisory
opinions to the Village regarding compliance with FOIA. A review may be
initiated upon receipt of a written request from the Village Mayor or the
Village Attorney, which shall contain sufficient accurate facts from which a
determination can be made. The Public Access Counselor may request additional
information from the village in order to assist in the review. If the village
relies in good faith on an advisory opinion of the Attorney General in
responding to a request, it is not liable for penalties under FOIA, so long as
the facts upon which the opinion is based have been fully and fairly disclosed
to the Public Access Counselor.

      (B)   Private information, unless disclosure is required by another
provision of this Act, a state or federal law or a court order.
      (C)   Personal information contained within public records, the
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual
subjects of the information. "Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" means
the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a
reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any
legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of
information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials
shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.
      (D)   Records in the possession of the village created in the course of
administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional
agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure
would:
         (i)   interfere with pending or actually and reasonably contemplated
law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement or correctional
agency that is the recipient of the request;
         (ii)   interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings
conducted by the village that is the recipient of the request;
         (iii)   create a substantial likelihood that a person will be deprived
of a fair trial or an impartial hearing;
         (iv)   unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source,
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons
who file complaints with or provide information to administrative,
investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies; except that the identities
of witnesses to traffic accidents, traffic accident reports, and rescue reports
shall be provided by agencies of local government, except when disclosure would
interfere with an active criminal investigation conducted by the agency that is
the recipient of the request;
         (v)   disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other
than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of
correctional agencies related to detection, observation or investigation of
incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable
harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;
         (vi)   endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement
personnel or any other person; or
         (vii)   obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation by the agency that
is the recipient of the request.

a private equity fund, nor to the identity of the fund's managers or general
partners. The exemption contained in this item does not apply to the identity
of a privately held company within the investment portfolio of a private equity

cause competitive harm. Nothing contained in this division (G) shall be
construed to prevent a person or business from consenting to disclosure.
      (H)   Proposals and bids for any contract, grant, or agreement, including
information which if it were disclosed would frustrate procurement or give an
advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contractor agreement with the
village, until an award or final selection is made. Information prepared by or
for the village in preparation of a bid solicitation shall be exempt until an
award or final selection is made.
      (I)   Valuable formulae, computer geographic systems, designs, drawings
and research data obtained or produced by any public body when disclosure could
reasonably be expected to produce private gain or public loss. The exemption

or plans that are designed to identify, prevent, or respond to potential
attacks upon a community's population or systems, facilities, or installations,

danger to the health or safety of the community, but only to the extent that
disclosure could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the effectiveness of the
measures or the safety of the personnel who implement them or the public.
Information exempt under this item may include such things as details
pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel or equipment, to the
operation of communication systems or protocols, or to tactical operations.

§ 38.41 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

due and owing.
   (B)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (C)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the village,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall

§ 38.42 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk's office.
(Ord. 01-04, passed 1-23-01)
§ 38.44 LIENS.
   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. 01-04, passed 1-23-01)
§ 38.45 APPLICATION.

of the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any present tax ordinance
is in conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall

   (A)   Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other

UTILITY COLLECTION PROCEDURES
§ 50.001 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPLICANT/CUSTOMER. Includes any person, firm, corporation, partnership, or
other legal entity which is the user or consumer of village utility services or
which is legally responsible for payment of rates, charges, and penalties for
such utility service by statute or ordinance.
   CHECK. Shall have the same definition as defined in 810 ILCS 5/3-104,
Uniform Commercial Code. (810 ILCS 5/3-104).
   DISHONORED. A check is DISHONORED when a necessary presentment is duly made

reason.
   FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. Any bank, savings and loan, credit union, or other
institution lawfully able to honor and pay checks drawn upon it.
   MASTER-METERED APARTMENT BUILDING. Any structure consisting of two or more
dwelling units where any utility service is registered or recorded by a single
meter for all of the units contained in the building.
   NONRESIDENTIAL SERVICE. Any building or outbuilding that does not meet the
criteria for residential electric service will be considered nonresidential in
nature and be eligible only for nonresidential electric service rates which the
village refers to as commercial, industrial or government rates.
   RATES AND CHARGES. Includes penalties assessed for late or delinquent
payments for utility services.
   RESIDENTIAL SERVICE. In order to qualify for residential electric service, a
property must comprise one or more separately metered dwelling units, each of
which provides living accommodations that include a minimum of a kitchen,
bedroom and bathroom. Each property fitting this definition will be limited to
one residential electric meter per residential unit. Any additional service may
be billed at the residential electric rate.
(Ord. 80-33, passed 12-16-80; Am. Ord. 81-10, passed 5-26-81; Am. Ord. 16-15,
passed 4-26-16)
§ 50.002 COLLECTION.
   Rates and charges for utility services supplied by the village shall be as
established by ordinance. The provisions of this chapter apply to collection of
all rates and charges for utility services supplied by the village, including
but not limited to electric, water, and sewer services.
(Ord. 80-33, passed 12-16-80; Am. Ord. 16-15, passed 4-26-16)
§ 50.003 DEPOSIT.
   (A)   Service deposit for residential service. 
      (1)   Customers including individuals who were previously listed on a
utility account such as former spouses or roommates who are re-applying for
residential service with the village who have had at least 12 continuous months
of service, during which no more than two late penalties were assessed and do
not owe any balance from previous service with the village are not required to
pay a service deposit. First-time applicants and applicants who have failed to
pay for previous service in a timely manner will be required to pay a service
deposit before service will be initiated.
      (2)   Existing customers with a good credit history reapplying for
service at a new location who have a deposit on file will have their deposit
transferred to their new service account for the remainder of the 18 months
holding period. Existing customers who do not have a good credit history and
have a past due balance on their existing utility account will be required to
pay their past due balance before the new service is established. The
customer's deposit will be transferred to their new service account and will be
held for a period of 18 months from the date the new service is connected.
      (3)   The amount of the residential service deposit is currently:
         (a)   $150 for property owners ($100 electric and $50 water); and
         (b)   $300 for rental property ($200 for electric and $100 for water).
This service deposit is adjusted periodically.
      (4)   Payment of the residential deposit must be made when the customer
signs up for service. Following 18 continuous months of service from the
village, the deposit will be returned in the form of a credit to the account.
If the customer terminates service before the deposit is credited, the deposit
will be applied to the account's final bill or transferred to the customer's
new service address within the village.
   (B)   Service deposit for nonresidential service.
      (1)   Previous nonresidential customers who are re-applying for service
under the same entity name will not be required to pay a service deposit if
their previous service lasted at least 12 months and either had no more than
two late penalties or, if they had more than two late penalties, the penalties
and past due balances were paid before the next bill was generated. First-time
nonresidential applicants and nonresidential applicants who have failed to pay
for previous service in a timely manner will be required to pay the service
deposit before service will be initiated. First- time nonresidential applicants
who have residential service on their owned, primary residence may avoid paying
the deposit for nonresidential service if:
         (a)   The nonresidential service is requested in the same name as the
residential service;
         (b)   The applicant applies for the nonresidential service in person;
         (c)   The applicant provides proof of ownership of his or her primary
residence;
         (d)   The applicant has no more than two late penalties on the
residential account; and
         (e)   The applicant agrees to the transfer of unpaid final bills to
any existing residential or nonresidential account.
      (2)   The amount of the nonresidential service deposit is currently $300
($200 electric and $100 water). This amount may be adjusted periodically.
However, a deposit may subsequently be required on the nonresidential account
if the customer fails to maintain payments on either the residential or
nonresidential account in a timely manner.
      (3)   After 18 months of service, the deposit maintained on account with
the village by a nonresidential customer will be credited to their account. If
the customer terminates service before the deposit is refunded, the deposit
will be applied to the account's final bill or transferred to the customer's
new service address within the village.
(Ord. 80-33, passed 12-16-80; Am. Ord. 16-15, passed 4-26-16)
§ 50.004 DUE DATE AND MONTHLY SERVICE PAYMENTS.
   (A)   In most circumstances, charges for service will be rendered on or
about the same day each month based on the service address. Monthly bills for
service are due on the 15th of each month. In applying for electric or water
service from the Village of Chatham, the customer agrees to pay for services as
bills are rendered in accordance with the rates, rules and regulations in
effect at the time of delivery. The customer remains responsible for these
charges until the customer gives the utility notice of discontinuance and final
charges on said account have been paid. Past due final charges may be
transferred to any active residential or nonresidential account being
maintained by or for the use of said customer.
   (B)   The village collects sewer charges. These charges are based on the
amount of water the customer uses. Unless an affidavit stating otherwise has
been filed with the village, the utility will assume each property receiving
water service is connected to the village's sewer system and that the total
amount of water consumed by the customer eventually enters the sewer system.
The customer will be responsible for paying all applicable sewer and water
service charges for the property. Customers with sprinkler systems can avoid
paying sewer charges on water used by those systems if they pay for the
installation of a separate meter for the sprinkler system.
   (C)   The village allows residents with swimming pools to check out a deduct
meter from the utility office to record water usage related to filling their
swimming pools. Meters must be returned during business hours within three
days. If a meter is not returned at the end of the three day period then a
$5.00 late fee per day will be added to the customer's bill until the meter is
returned. An adjustment for sewer usage will be applied to the customer's
account based on the metered water usage recorded on the deduct meters.
(Ord. 80-33, passed 12-16-80; Am. Ord. 16-15, passed 4-26-16)
§ 50.005 DELINQUENT CHARGES; DISCONTINUED SERVICE.
   If services are not paid in full by the due date on each monthly bill, a
five day grace period would be allowed before a penalty charge of 10% per month
will be imposed on the bill. Customers may be allowed a one-time penalty waiver
if there have been no late payments on the account. This one- time penalty
waiver will only be allowed once in a 12 month period.
   (A)   If any charges for utility service or penalties remain unpaid for 30
days after the billing date, such charges shall be deemed delinquent and
subject to a disconnect notice; service may be interrupted until all delinquent
amounts are paid in full. If service is interrupted due to delinquency, the
customer will be required to pay a reconnect charge of $50 before service will
be restored. The reconnect charges may be adjusted periodically.
   (B)   Upon determination that any customer's service is to be disconnected
due to a past due bill, the village shall send to the customer, owner, or any
other person required by law to receive notice, at the address at which the
service is provided, notice that the utility service shall be terminated no
sooner than seven days after the mailing of that notice. When the user is a
person other than the owner of the premises at which service is provided, a
copy of the notice shall also be sent to the owner at his address shown on an
application for service, or at the owner's last address then known to the
village.
      (1)   The notice shall include:
         (a)   The dollar amount owed;
         (b)   The date that payment must be received by to avoid
disconnection;
         (c)   The contact information for the Village of Chatham Utility
Office;
         (d)   That upon disconnection, service will not be reconnected until
all delinquent charges and reconnect charges are paid in full; and
         (e)   That prior to reconnection, the customer shall be required to
pay a reconnect service charge.
   (C)   Unless the disconnection or termination is completed within 21 days of
the date the notice was mailed, no disconnection or termination may be made
without issuance of a new notice of termination in the manner provided in (B)
above.
(Ord. 80-33, passed 12-16-80; Am. Ord. 16-15, passed 4-26-16)
§ 50.006 DISCONTINUED SERVICE TO APARTMENTS OR RENTAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Landlord, owner and tenant responsibility for active service.
      (1)   All landlords/owners should advise the village when they purchase a
new property or relinquish ownership of a property receiving utility service
from the village.
      (2)   The owner of any lot, building, or premises and the occupant
thereof and the customer of the utility service of said system shall be jointly
and severally liable to pay for such utility service on said premises; and, the
service shall be furnished to the premises by the village only upon the
condition that the owner of the premises, occupant, and customer of the utility
service are jointly and severally liable.
      (3)   Landlords/property owners shall be responsible for paying for
active village utility services provided to their leased/rented properties when
a tenant does not apply or qualify for services. Landlords or owners shall have
the option of:
         (a)   Retaining service and paying all charges in their name during
the periods of time when an active tenant does not apply or qualify for service
from the village; or
         (b)   Having service disconnected when an active tenant does not apply
or qualify for service.
      (4)   If the landlord/owner directs a new tenant to provide proof that
village utility service has been placed in the tenant's name, the village will
provide the tenant with such confirmation.
   (B)   Master-metered and multi-area single-metered properties.
      (1)   Utility service in buildings with multiple dwelling units served by
one master meter (house meter) must be billed in the name of the landlord/owner
or his or her duly appointed agent. (Agents appointed to act in the name of the
landlord/ owner must be identified and authorized in writing to the village by
the landlord/owner.) Likewise, single meters that serve more than one tenant's
area must be billed in the name of the landlord/owner until each service is
exclusive to a single tenanted area. A facility charge will be billed for each
unit of the building.
      (2)   When disconnection for nonpayment of service is scheduled for a
master-metered property, notice shall be posted on the premises five days
before the disconnect date. All tenants would be sent notice in accordance with
the Rental Property Utility Service Act. Tenants may petition the circuit court
of Sangamon County for appointment of a receiver to collect the rent due and
remit a portion to the village for payment of village utility bills.
      (3)   Landlords/owners are responsible for clearly and permanently
identifying, by stencil or other means, the apartment, mobile home or area
served by each meter. Once meters have been installed and identified, the
landlord/owner is responsible for meeting with a village representative to
verify that each meter services the correct unit and is accurately, clearly and
permanently identified.
      (4)   When incorrect billing results from incorrectly identified meters,
the village is not responsible for credit adjustments to bills issued prior to
being notified the meters were incorrectly identified. Upon notification from
the landlord/owner of incorrectly identified meters, the village will correct
all future billing records to reflect the correct meter identification for the
units/areas they service.
(Ord. 80-33, passed 12-16-80; Am. Ord. 16-15, passed 4-26-16)
§ 50.007 DISCONTINUED SERVICE OF RESIDENTIAL HEATING.
   Utility service which is the sole source of residential space heating or
which controls the space heating equipment of residential premises may not be
disconnected unless and until due notice is given to the customer and those
other persons as required by Article 11, Division 117 of the Municipal Code of
1961, as now or hereafter amended.

of the matter, in writing, directed to the Village Clerk. The village shall not
disconnect the service of any person for non-payment during the pendency of the
dispute if:
      (1)   Written notice is given to the Village Clerk as herein provided;
and
      (2)   Payment of all undisputed portions of the bill is made; and
      (3)   All charges made during the pendency of the dispute are paid as
due; and
      (4)   The person making the complaint or dispute enters into a bona fide
effort to resolve the disputed matter with all due dispatch.
   (B)   Notice of a dispute shall be made in writing and contain the name,
address, and telephone number of the person making the complaint or disputing a
charge; the address at which utility service is received which is the subject
of the complaint or dispute; the specific grounds or reasons for which the
charges billed are disputed; and the specific relief requested.
   (C)   Upon filing of the notice, the corporate authorities may hear and
determine such dispute at their next ensuing meeting. The corporate authorities
shall give the complaining party no less than five days advance written notice
of the date of such hearing. The complaining party may, at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof present additional information or evidence in support of
the dispute, but no such information or evidence shall be received or

lien upon the premises served. The Village Administrator or his or her designee
shall file with the County Recorder of Deeds a statement of lien claim. This
statement shall contain a legal description of the premises served, the amount
of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount
as well as for all charges subsequent to the period covered by the bill. A copy
of the statement of lien claim shall at the same time be mailed to the
customer, and if the Village Administrator or his or her designee has notice
that the customer is not the owner of the premises served, a copy of the
statement of lien claim shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if the
owner's address is then known to the Village Administrator or his or her
designee. The failure of the Village Administrator or his or her designee to
record the lien claim or to mail the notice, or the failure of the owner to
receive the notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid
bills.
   (B)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for
nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay
the charges, after deducting costs therefor. The foreclosure shall be by action
brought in the name of the village pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-139-8 in the same
manner and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real
estate. The Village Attorney is hereby authorized to institute these
proceedings for the purpose of foreclosing the lien in the name of the village
in any court having jurisdiction over such matters and may recover other costs
and reasonable attorneys fees as may be incurred and as may be allowed by the
court.

CUSTOMER BILLING
§ 50.050 MULTI-MONTH BILLINGS.
   (A)   There are some circumstances in which village customers might be

provided by the utility. Such billings may cover multiple months of service.
These circumstances can include, but are not limited to, the village’s
discovery that:
      (1)   A slow-running meter has been providing an inaccurate measure of
customer consumption;
      (2)   A meter has stopped, resulting in no registered usage;
      (3)   A customer who signed up for and received service was inadvertently
omitted from the monthly billing system; and
      (4)   Meter tampering has resulted in the utility's inability to properly
bill for service in a timely manner.
   (B)   Except where tampering has occurred, if the village has failed to bill
for services or commodities it has provided, the back billing will be limited
to 12 months for residential service and 24 months for nonresidential service.

equipment and the customer has enjoyed the benefits of such tampering, the
utility is not restricted to the above time limitations on unbilled services.

      (2)   Inaccurately measured the quantity or volume of service provided.
   (B)    For residential customers, credits will be limited to the 24-month
period immediately preceding discovery that an overcharge is occurring.
Nonresidential customers are limited to the preceding 24-month period. Any

Board of Trustees if extenuating circumstances can be shown as determined by
the Village Board and sufficient records are produced to evidence the
overpayment.

charges will be limited to the 24-month period immediately preceding discovery
that an undercharge is occurring. Nonresidential customers are limited to the
preceding 24-month period.

enter into a Payment Arrangement.
   (B)   Under the terms of the Promissory Payment Arrangement:

unable to identify a specific leak source, may still qualify for the relief
offered herein, provided the criteria in division (A) are otherwise met and
further provided that through meter readings, the village is able to confirm
the increase in consumption has ceased.
   (E)   The village may offer an Extended Payment Plan under the following
circumstances: a customer has been back billed for utility services, a customer
has a large balance remaining after an adjustment is granted under the water
leak adjustment policy, or for a large balance due for a water leak that was

water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer's potable water systems.
   (B)    Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the village. These
regulations are applicable to all water systems as long as such are physically
connected to the public potable water supply system of the village, regardless
of whether such system is actually in use. The consumer shall bear the ultimate
responsibility of ensuring compliance with this appendix.
(C)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or backsiphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service

   (D)   The licensee shall transport yard waste to composting centers or other
facilities which accept yard waste only.

materials and yard waste of its own customers; however, licensees may agree
among themselves to handle the recyclable materials and yard waste of another

REGULATIONS FOR OPERATION
§ 53.015 RATE STRUCTURES.
   A licensee may set its own rates, subject only to the following
restrictions:
   (A)   The licensee shall set volume-based rates for commercial and
industrial customers for collection of unseparated solid waste, and shall
dispose of recyclable materials from such customers free of charge. The
licensee may agree with such customers on any frequency of pickup of solid
waste, provided that all waste is picked up at least once per week. Because the
needs of commercial and industrial customers vary so greatly from customer to
customer, the licensee need not announce a rate of general applicability, and
is free, subject to state and federal law, to discriminate among commercial and
industrial customers in the matter of rates.
   (B)   For residential customers, each licensee shall charge a basic fee,
which will entitle each customer to a once weekly pickup and disposal of one
32-gallon garbage can or a 33-gallon bag of unseparated solid waste, not to
exceed 60 pounds. For unseparated solid waste in excess of the basic service,
the licensee shall charge a per 32-gallon can or 33-gallon bag fee. The
customer shall purchase stickers for such additional cans and bags from the
licensee, and shall affix a sticker to each additional can or bag to be picked
up in addition to the basic service. The rates for residential customers shall
be of general applicability, and there shall be no discrimination among
residential customers as to rates; however, senior citizen discounts are
permissible.
   (C)   Recyclable materials shall be picked up from residential customers
free of charge.
   (D)   Rates for disposal of yard waste shall be volume-based. The licensee
shall charge separately for each 32-gallon can or 33-gallon bag of yard waste.
The customer shall purchase stickers from the licensees and shall affix a
sticker to each can or bag of yard waste. A yard waste sticker shall cost no
less than a sticker for unseparated solid waste.
   (E)   A licensee may change its rates from time to time in its discretion.
The licensee shall provide the Village Administrator with a copy of any rate
change for residential customers at least 30 days in advance of the rate
change, and shall inform each residential customer of the rate change in
writing at least 30 days in advance of its effective date. Notice to customers
may, in the discretion of the licensee, be made by an insert in the monthly
bill. No rate change shall be effective unless these notice provisions are
complied with.
(Ord. 91-26, passed 6-11-91)
§ 53.016 PROCEDURES IN THE EVENT OF UNMARKETABILITY OF RECYCLABLES.
   A licensee may relieve itself of the obligation to pick up and dispose of
any class of recyclable materials by submitting to the Village Administrator
proof of the lack of a reasonable market for such recyclable material. Proof
shall consist of a written statement detailing the efforts the licensee has
made to seek a market for that class of recyclable material and any other
written material the licensee may have in its possession regarding market
trends. Upon receipt of such material, the Village Administrator shall have 15
working days in which to verify the validity of the licensee’s statement and to
seek a market for the class of recyclable materials. If the Village
Administrator finds the licensee’s statement is correct and is unable to find a
market, the licensee may upon 14 calendar days notice to its customers, require
the customers to place the unmarketable class of recyclable material with the
unseparated solid waste for pickup. With any subsequent license application,
the licensee shall submit written information substantiating the continued
unavailability of a market for that class of recyclable materials.

§ 53.017 UNLICENSED WASTE COLLECTION PROHIBITED.
   No person, firm or corporation not licensed hereunder may collect or
transport solid waste within the corporate limits of the village. No person
other than a licensee hereunder may remove recyclable materials from any
premises located within the corporate limits of the village. This section shall
not be a limitation on the right of any bona fide nonprofit, religious,
charitable or educational organization to collect recyclable materials on the
premises of such organization, or on the right of any person to give recyclable
materials to such organizations or to sell or give his own recyclable materials
to a recyclable dealer.

53.999
§ 53.018 COLLECTION OF OVER-SIZED SOLID WASTE.
   A licensee under this chapter shall have no obligation to collect, but may
collect for a fee set forth in the licensee’s rate structure, solid waste
materials, including but not limited to appliances, furniture, carpets, trees,
and the like, which do not fit into a 32-gallon container or 33-gallon bag or
weigh in excess of 60 pounds per item. From time to time, the Village
Administrator shall make arrangements for the pickup, disposal, and where
appropriate, recycling, of such materials. Residents of and commercial and
industrial establishments in the village may themselves remove and dispose of
such materials or contract with non-licensees hereunder for the removal of such
materials.

   (A)   An animal impounded under the provisions of this chapter, except an

an impounding fee of $50 per animal payable to the county animal control center
in the form of cash, cashier’s check, or money order in addition to the fees
set forth in division (B) of this section. Prior to disposition, animals shall
be held for a minimum of three calendar days, if the owner is not known, and
for a minimum of seven calendar days, if the owner is known, in order to give
the owner an opportunity to redeem the animal. Animals which have bitten
persons are subject to an impoundment of at least 10 days in the county pound.
   (B)   Pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement with the village, the
county will remit the impounding fee to the village. Any owner or keeper
desiring to redeem an impounded animal shall, as a condition of release:
      (1)   Show proof of inoculation or pay the requisite deposit as set forth
in division (D); and
      (2)   Pay to the county animal control officer, or reimburse the village,
for all fees charged by the county pound or to be charged by the county pound
for responding to any and all calls with respect to the animal, picking up the
animal, and boarding the animal. The county animal control’s hourly charges and
boarding fees for impounded animals are established by the county and are
outside the village’s control.
   (C)   If the animal is in the county pound, it may be released only upon the
owner’s showing of proof of inoculation, or by payment by the owner of the
county pound’s charges for inoculation. If the owner cannot show proof of
inoculation, then in addition to all other charges, the owner shall pay the
county animal control the amount of money required for inoculation, which fee
is established by the county.
   (D)   The owner of an impounded animal shall pay the county animal control
center directly for all impoundment fees, costs, and services rendered. In the
event that the village is billed for the fees, costs, and services rendered,
the village will be entitled to collect costs from the owner in the amount of
$80 per hour for each call, with a minimum one hour charge and boarding fees
for impounded animals of $10 per day.

§ 90.23 VICIOUS DOG (ANIMALS).
   (A)   In order to have an animal deemed “vicious,” an animal control
officer, Chief of Police, or the Village Attorney, must give notice of the
infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner. The police
department shall conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses,
including the owner, gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical
records, or behavioral evidence, and make a detailed report recommending a
finding that the animal is a vicious animal, and give the report to the State’s
Attorney’s office and the owner. The State’s Attorney, or Village Attorney, or
animal control officer may file a complaint in the circuit court to deem a dog
to be a vicious dog. Testimony of a certified applied behaviorist, a board-
certified veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert may be relevant
to the court’s determination of whether the dog’s behavior was justified. The
petitioner must prove the dog is a vicious dog by clear and convincing
evidence. The county animal control shall determine where the animal shall be
confined during the pendency of the case. The provisions and appeal rights of
this section shall be carried out pursuant to § 15 of the Animal Control Act,
510 ILCS 5/15.
   (B)   If the dog is found to be a vicious dog, the dog shall be spayed or
neutered within 10 days of the finding at the expense of its owner and
microchipped, and subject to enclosure. A dog found to be a vicious dog shall
not be released to the owner until the animal control warden or Chief of Police
approves the enclosure. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give
away the dog without court approval. Whenever an owner of a vicious dog
relocates, he or she shall notify both the administrator of county animal
control where he or she has relocated and the administrator of county animal
control where he or she formerly resided.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which
has been found to be a vicious dog unless the dog is kept in an enclosure. The
only times that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure are (1) if it
is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the dog, (2)
in the case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog’s life is
threatened, or (3) to comply with the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, provided that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a
leash not exceeding six feet in length and that it shall be under the direct
control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dog or muzzled in its
residence.
   (D)   Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not
confined to an enclosure shall be impounded by the administrator, an animal
control warden, or the law enforcement authority having jurisdiction in such
area.
   (E)   If the owner of the dog has not appealed the impoundment order to the
circuit court in the county in which the animal was impounded within 15 working
days, the dog may be euthanized.
   (F)   Upon filing notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be
automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear
the burden of timely notification to animal control in writing.
   (G)   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this section, provided that an attack or injury to a person occurs while the
dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this
section, each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in
accordance with §
90.04 . It shall be the duty of the owner of such exempted dog to notify the
administrator of changes of address. In the case of a sentry or guard dog, the
owner shall keep the administrator advised of the location where such dog will
be stationed. The administrator shall provide police and fire departments with
a categorized list of such exempted dogs and shall promptly notify such
departments of any address changes reported to him or her.

the Chief of Police or animal control officer becoming aware of the alleged
infraction, notifications to the owner of the alleged infractions, the fact of
the initiation of an investigation, and affording the owner an opportunity to
meet with the Chief of Police or animal control officer prior to the making of
a determination; gathering of any medical or veterinary evidence; interviewing
witnesses; and making a detailed written report—an animal control warden or
Chief of Police may ask the administrator of the county animal control, or his
or her designee, to deem a dog to be “dangerous.” No dog shall be deemed a
“dangerous dog” without clear and convincing evidence. The owner shall be sent
immediate notification of the determination by registered or certified mail
that includes a complete description of the appeal process.
   (B)   A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the administrator, his or her
designee, or the director determines the conduct of the dog was justified
because:
      (1)   The threat was sustained by a person who at the time was committing
an offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog;
      (2)   The threatened person was tormenting, abusing, assaulting, or
physically threatening the dog or its offspring;
      (3)   The injured, threatened, or killed companion animal was attacking
or threatening to attack the dog or its offspring; or
      (4)   The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself,
its owner, custodian, or a member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
   (C)   Testimony of a certified applied behaviorist, a board-certified
veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert may be relevant to the
determination of whether the dog’s behavior was justified pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
   (D)   If deemed dangerous, the administrator, or his or her designee, or the
director shall order the dog to be spayed or neutered within 14 days at the
owner’s expense and microchipped, if not already, and one or more of the
following as deemed appropriate under the circumstances and necessary for the
protection of the public:
      (1)   Evaluation of the dog by a certified applied behaviorist, a board-
certified veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert in the field and
completion of training or other treatment as deemed appropriate by the expert.
The owner of the dog shall be responsible for all costs associated with
evaluations and training ordered under this subsection; or
      (2)   Direct supervision by an adult 18 years of age or older whenever
the animal is on public premises.
   (E)   The administrator or Chief of Police may order a dangerous dog to be
muzzled whenever it is on public premises in a manner that will prevent it from
biting any person or animal, but that shall not injure the dog or interfere
with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this section, provided that an attack or injury to a person occurs while the
dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this
section, each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies and
performing duties as expected. It shall be the duty of the owner of the
exempted dog to notify the administrator of changes of address. In the case of
a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the administrator advised of the
location where such dog will be stationed. The administrator shall provide
police and fire departments with a categorized list of the exempted dogs and
shall promptly notify the departments of any address changes reported to him or
her.

employees, equipment and fuel for removal of nuisance vegetation, rubbish and
pests and exceed $100 per hour. The corporate authorities of the village hereby

occupant or lessee shall be the village’s out-of-pocket expenses, plus a $25
service charge for administering the contract, which the corporate authorities

shall constitute a lien upon the real estate, and the Village Clerk or other
designee shall file a notice of lien in the office of the County Recorder of
Deeds, and mail a copy of the lien to the last ascertainable owner of record,

lien.

village or someone working on behalf of the village.

the property owner, his or her agent or legal representative or occupant in
legal possession or control of the premises and, if different, to the person
who received the tax bill for the preceding year.
      (2)   Release of lien.  Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (3)   Foreclosure of lien. Subsequent to the filing of the above-
described lien, the village may cause to be filed a complaint for foreclosure
of the lien, or upon becoming a defendant in a pending lawsuit affecting the
premises or real estate, by answer to the complaint or in the nature of an
intervening petition or cross-complaint, the village may proceed in its
corporate name to foreclose the lien. An action to foreclose a lien under this
section must be commenced within two years after the date of filing notice of
lien. The property subject to a lien arising under this section shall be sold
for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to
pay the monies owing the village.
   (D)   Suit. In addition to any other action authorized by this chapter or by
the Illinois Municipal Code, the village may, to the extent permitted by law,
bring suit to foreclose the lien and to sue the owner or lessee or occupant of
the real estate or their agent, in a civil action to recover the money due for
services rendered, plus all expenses and reasonable attorney fees to be fixed
by the court. Any such judgment shall be enforced in accordance with law. In
addition io the charges due, the village is entitled to collect the costs of
filing a notice of lien, foreclosing the lien and litigation costs, together
with all office and legal expenses incurred in connection with the collection

APPENDIX A: ANIMAL ESCAPE PROCEDURES
Section
   
1.   Animal escape procedures
§ 1. ANIMAL ESCAPE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Prevention of animal escape is an integral component in escape
procedures. Prevention entails the maintenance of the integrity of the
facilities and the practice of appropriate husbandry techniques. Inherent to
the operation, a zoo exhibits animals that are considered an immediate threat
to human life if they were to escape. Certainly, the escape of any animal can
be a very serious matter if not handled in a strategic and timely fashion.
   (B)   The actual response to an animal escape will vary depending upon type
of animal, time of day, and place of escape. The goal of each response is
recapture of the animal without injury to the animal, staff, or public. While
even the most dangerous animals may be successfully returned to their
enclosures if appropriate procedures are followed, all escapes can entail risk
to the animal, personnel, or public.
   (C)   If a potentially dangerous animal escapes:
      (1)   Notify all employees of the escape and calmly evacuate all persons
to the nearest building away from the area of disturbance. Instruct them to
stay until notified by the zoo staff that it is safe to exit. Make certain that
all windows and doors are closed and locked.
      (2)   Close and lock all gates and guard if possible.
      (3)   The Chatham Police Department shall be notified that an animal has
escaped, and supplied with details on what animal has escaped, and the last
known location. Police officers will not take part in the recapture. The police
function will be to provide crowd control and notification of neighboring areas
to remain indoors. They may also assist in communications with other emergency
personnel. If the animal, in the Police Departments judgement, is a direct and
immediate threat to human life, the police force will assist, order or carry
out the destruction of the animal.
      (4)   Zoo personnel should try to keep the animal under surveillance from
a safe distance or a vehicle, never place your safety in danger. Always move
slowly and back out of any situation involving a predatory animal. Keep in mind
that most animals, if not severely panicked after escape, will try to go back
to their exhibits on their own. Never chase an escaped animal, you want the
animal to stay near the exhibit and remain unfrightened. An attempt will be
made to slowly drive the animal towards a corral or exhibit, confine it until
it is immobilized, or otherwise manually regain control over it.
      (5)   Once the animal is recaptured, the zoo director will transmit an
all clear signal to zoo personnel. Zoo staff will inform non-zoo personnel that
the situation is again normal. The senior police officer will account for all
personnel involved in the operation and will designate a squad to check the
area involved for injured persons and damage.

paid by the cable service or video service.

been or will be added to the inventory previously filed pursuant to this
chapter by purchase, acquisition on consignment, or otherwise. The application
for renewal of the license shall be made not more than 14 days prior to the
time of the expiration of the license and shall contain a new inventory of the
goods remaining on hand at the time the application for renewal is made, which

fire, smoke, water, or otherwise, or in the case of an insurance sale or a
salvage sale, the goods to be sold at the sale shall be clearly and distinctly
segregated, marked or identified, and advertised, if at all, so that both on
display and in advertising such goods may be readily distinguished from other
stock and their identity readily ascertained. Any commingling of the goods with
other stocks of the licensee in such a manner to cause the goods to lose their
separate identity, either on display or in advertising, shall be unlawful and
shall void any license issued to conduct the sale pursuant to this chapter, and
the license shall cease to apply to the sale.
   (B)   No person in contemplation of conducting any going out of business,
removal, assignee's, or creditor's sale, or during the continuance of such a
sale, shall order or purchase any goods for the purpose of selling them at the
sale, and any unusual purchase or addition to the stock of the goods within 60
days before the filing of the application for a license to conduct the sale
shall be presumptive evidence that the purchases or additions were made in
contemplation of the sale and for the purpose of selling them at the sale.

the license, or any person violating any of the other provisions of this
chapter shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor as defined in the Unified Code
of Corrections of the State of Illinois the applicable sections of which are
hereby accepted by this chapter. Each false statement of fact in an application

not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction
of the Department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment
of the tax. The retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of the retailer to collect

Department at its discretion.

in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground
systems and the like, SERVICE ADDRESS shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER. A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees, engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by this chapter.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS. In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two- way communications, or any

of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by the provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered “telecommunications”
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this definition,
PREPAID TELEPHONE CALLING ARRANGEMENTS means that term as defined in 35 ILCS
120/2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.
(Ord. 03-42, passed 9-9-03)
§ 116.02 SIMPLIFIED MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAX IMPOSED.
   The tax is hereby imposed upon any and all of the following acts or
privileges:
   (A)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of 6%
of the gross charge for the telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of 6%
of the gross charge for the telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege that
is subject to taxation under this chapter, any taxpayer, upon proof that the
taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on the event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the
extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the other state which
was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in
this state.
   (C)   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on the act or privilege
to the extent the act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes
of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the municipality.

§ 116.03 COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS.
   (A)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by the retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any tax collected by the
retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for the sale at
retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the
manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
(Ord. 03-42, passed 9-9-03)
§ 116.04 RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT.
   Commencing on January 1, 2004, the tax imposed under this chapter on
telecommunication retailers shall be returned with the appropriate forms and
information as required by the Department pursuant to 35 ILCS 636/5-50 of the
Illinois Simplified Tax Act and any accompanying rules and regulations created
by the Department to implement this Act.
(Ord. 03-42, passed 9-9-03)
§ 116.05 RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of telecommunications, the person shall apply to the Department for
a resale number. The applicant shall state facts which will show the Department
why the applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this chapter on any
of the purchases and shall furnish additional information as the Department may
reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive telecommunication tax-free when the actions
in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's
having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to the
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

(Ord. 99-03, passed 1-26-99)
§ 117.24 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Superintendent
of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does
not conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws,
rules, and regulations, the Superintendent of Public Works shall reject such
application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Superintendent of
Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements
of this chapter and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Superintendent of Public Works shall issue a permit therefor
as soon as practicable. The Superintendent of Public Works may consult with the
Village Engineer with respect to any application for a permit.
   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act (220 ILCS 65/4) a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not less than ten10 days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent of Public Works
shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be
placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Superintendent of Public Works fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either:
          (a)   Ten10 days after service of notice to the village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction; or
         (b)   Twenty-five days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
117.23, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.
(Ord. 99-03, passed 1-26-99)
§ 117.25 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations.
(Ord. 99-03, passed 1-26-99)
§ 117.26 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
117.49. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Ord. 99-03, passed 1-26-99) Penalty, see §
117.99
§ 117.27 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
divisions (A)(1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X,” “C,” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Clerk of such intent to cancel or not
to renew.”
   Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event
later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and
furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-
insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division
(A) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self-
insurer” under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility liability. The legal
liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters
that are the subject of the insurance policies or self- insurance required by
this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance
or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
(Ord. 99-03, passed 1-26-99) Penalty, see §
117.99
§ 117.28 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 99-03, passed 1-26-99)
§ 117.29 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)    The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form.   The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village
in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Superintendent of Public Works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of division (C) of this section for any single
phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

revocation. The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend
the time periods provided in division (C) of this section.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of
this section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the village or
its designee may, at the option of the village:
      (1)   Correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   Upon not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   After not less than 30 days notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the village. The
permittee shall be liable in all events to the village for all costs of
removal.

accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the villages right-
of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICCs
rules entitled, “Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines” (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.

armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)    The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled as soon as
practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as designated by
the Superintendent of Public Works.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot-type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            (1)   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair, and
            (2)   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

§ 117.45 VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (B)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Superintendent of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.

Superintendent of Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request
shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Superintendent of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Superintendent of Public
Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Superintendent of Public Works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.

§ 117.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

§ 152.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 07-27, passed 6-12-07)
§ 152.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other chapters adopted by the village to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. However, this
chapter does not repeal the original resolution or chapter adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate or impair
any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other chapter easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 07-27, passed 6-12-07)
§ 152.14 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and
the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of
the remainder.
(Ord. 07-27, passed 6-12-07)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Zoning Board of Appeals
may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify the owner in writing of such
violation.

      (4)   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (B)   (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to issue an order
requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall
be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance and shall order the action,
if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The
stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 TITLE.
   This chapter may be cited as "The 1994 Land Subdivision Ordinance of the
Village of Chatham, Illinois."
(Ord. 94-01, passed 1-25-94)
§ 155.002 JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The subdivision jurisdiction of the village shall include all land

the boundary of the village at any given point on the line.
(Ord. 94-01, passed 1-25-94)
§ 155.003 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote growth and development and to
regulate and control the division of land within the subdivision approval
jurisdiction of the village in order to provide for the legal and orderly
division of land by requiring proper description, monumentation and recording

public health and safety and provides essential public services to existing and
future residents. The goals of this chapter shall be to promote:
   (A)   Conformance with the Chatham Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Provision of adequate public services including public water and

   (H)   Establishment of lots that are of a practical size and shape.
   (I)   Enhancement and preservation of aesthetic qualities.
   (J)   Providing for perpetual maintenance of private drainage works.
(Ord. 94-01, passed 1-25-94; Am. Ord. 10-01, passed 1-12-10)
§ 155.004 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of the ordinance shall not be affected by that decision.
(Ord. 94-01, passed 1-25-94)
§ 155.005 PLAT; WHEN REQUIRED.
   It shall be unlawful for a subdivider of land within the subdivision
jurisdiction of the village to subdivide land into lots, blocks, streets,
alleys, or public open space unless by plat in accordance with the laws of the
state and the provisions of this chapter. It shall be unlawful to divide land
without obtaining tract survey approval, when required.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply, except as noted with
respect to tract surveys, and no plat is required in any of the following
instances (Plats Act, 765 ILCS 205/0.01 et seq.)
      (1)   The division or subdivision of land into parcels or tracts of five
acres or more in size which does not involve any new streets or easements of
access;
      (2)   The division of lots or blocks of less than one acre in any
recorded subdivision which does not involve any new streets or easements of
access, including but not limited to the division of a single lot to form a
zero lot line duplex, as that term is defined in §
158.004 of this code, subject to the following additional requirements:
         (a)   The tract survey shall show that duplex structure is or shall be
bisected by the lot line, and each dwelling unit is or shall be located
exclusively on one lot, except for a party wall which is bisected by the lot
line;
         (b)   A party wall agreement or other appropriate covenant, perpetual
in duration and running with the land, has been recorded with the Recorder of
Deeds of Sangamon County with respect to both lots, or will be recorded
contemporaneously with the tract survey, which provides for the perpetual
maintenance of the party wall and reconstruction of the structure in event of
fire or casualty, and a copy of such party wall agreement or other appropriate
covenant has been provided to and approved by the Plat Officer of the village;
         (c)   The tract survey includes on its face the recording information
for the party wall agreement and other covenants;
         (d)   A lot which has been subdivided into two lots pursuant to this
division (A)(2) shall not be further subdivided;
      (3)   The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining
and contiguous land except where the transfer results in the creation of
another buildable lot;

      (8)   The sale or exchange of parcels or tracts of land following the
division into no more than two parts of a particular parcel or tract of land
existing on July 17, 1959 and not involving any new streets or easements of
access. If a division is made prior to 10-1-73 for which an exemption is
claimed pursuant to this subdivision, and the division results in one part
being greater than five acres and the other part being less than five acres,
then the subsequent division of the part greater than five acres shall qualify
for the exemption set forth in subdivision (A)(9) of this section. If a
division is made on or after 10-1-73 for which an exemption is claimed pursuant
to this subdivision, and the division results in one part being greater than
five acres and the other part being less than five acres then the subsequent
division of the part greater than five acres shall not qualify for the
exemption set forth subdivision (A)(9).
      (9)   The sale of a single lot less than five acres from a tract of five
acres or larger when a survey is made by a registered surveyor; provided,
however, that this exemption shall not apply to the sale of any subsequent lots
from the same larger tract of land, as determined by the dimensions and
configuration of the larger tract on October 1, 1973, and provided that this
exemption does not invalidate any other local requirements applicable to the
subdivision of the land.
      (10)   The division of a lot of record as of August 10, 1993, if the new
lots created by such division, together with any structures existing as of the
date of the division, meet all requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for the
Village of Chatham with respect to the Zoning District in which such new lots
are located, and not involving any new streets or easements of access.
Provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to the further division
of any lots created thereby.
   (B)   A tract survey shall be required for a division or subdivision of land
for which no plat is required under division (A) of this section. All tract
surveys shall be approved and recorded in accordance with §§
155.150 through
155.153 of this chapter.

§ 155.022 SUBDIVISION SITE SUITABILITY.
   (A)   Essential utilities and public services. Land proposed to be
subdivided shall have essential utilities and public services available within
a reasonable distance and time period. Land to which these essential utilities
and services will not be so provided shall be deemed unsuitable for
subdividing. Essential utilities and services and criteria for determining if
they can adequately be provided shall include the following:
      (1)   Sewage disposal:
         (a)   Sanitary sewer service provided by the Springfield Metro
Sanitary District shall be the preferred method of sewage disposal. If sanitary
sewer service is currently available to the land proposed to be subdivided, it
shall be the sewage disposal method used.
         (b)   If sanitary sewer service is not currently available but the
land is within the ultimate service area as identified in the Springfield Metro
Sanitary District's Facility Plan and the Sanitary District determines that
sewer service will be available within a reasonable period, the land may be
deemed suitable for subdividing if:
            1.   Sanitary sewers shall be installed by the subdivider for
future service to each building site; and
            2.   On-site sewage disposal facilities can and will be provided.
         (c)   If the land cannot be served with sanitary trunk sewers within a
reasonable period, or if the land is not within the ultimate service area as
identified in the Springfield Sanitary District's Facility Plan and therefore
shall be unsuitable for subdividing unless it can be shown that adequate
private sewage systems can be provided.
      (2)   Water supply:
         (a)   An Illinois Environmental Protection Agency approved public
water supply shall be the preferred method of water supply.
         (b)   Private wells may be permitted for developments outside the
village if the developer can demonstrate that it is not feasible to extend
water mains to the land proposed to be subdivided. As a minimum guideline, the
extension of 120' +- of water main per lot of the preliminary plan shall be
deemed feasible. This distance shall be measured between the nearest suitable
public water main and the proposed development. Mains within the development
shall not count toward this extension footage.
      (3)   Fire protection: Land proposed to be subdivided shall meet the
following conditions in order to be deemed suitable for subdividing:
         (a)   Land shall be within a fire protection district, if possible;
         (b)   There shall be a public road providing adequate access for
emergency vehicles to the site, in accordance with the criteria outlined in §
155.022(A)(4)(a) below.
         (c)   There shall be a system of water mains or other source of water
adequate for fire fighting purposes. Specific fire flows shall be determined by
the Chatham Fire Protection District using a standard published by the
Insurance Service Office entitled “Guide for Determination of Required Fire
Flow”.
         (d)   A full sprinkler system installed with adequate water available
as determined by the National Fire Protection Association Standards 13 or 13D
depending on the occupancy of the building shall also satisfy this requirement.
      (4)   Streets:
         (a)   The suitability of existing streets for access to the proposed
subdivision and/or for incorporation into the proposed subdivision’s street
system shall also be considered. A street shall be considered suitable if:
            1.   The street is constructed of all weather material (concrete,
asphalt, oil mat);
            2.   For low volume residential development (less than 250 vehicles
per day), the pavement has the strength to carry fire trucks (minimum two-inch
asphalt on six-inch crushed rock or equivalent);
            3.   For higher volume residential developments (greater than 250
vehicles per day) and non-residential developments, a traffic impact study and
pavement evaluation/design may be required to assess the suitability of
adjacent existing streets to support the anticipated traffic volume and loading
for the intended use. Pavements shall be designed for the 10 year traffic
projections for the anticipated future development in the area. The paved area
is at least 20 feet wide with a road bed 24 feet wide;
            4.   There is a minimum vertical clearance of 14 feet, six inches;
            5.   The street has adequate cross slope and roadside ditch or
storm sewer capacity; and
            6.   Access roads and access road intersections that serve the
development must meet safety standards, including sight distance.
         (b)   If only a portion of the criteria set forth in division (A)(4)
is met, the village’s consulting engineer, a representative of the Chatham Fire
Protection District, and a representative of the Planning Commission shall make
the recommendation as to whether the street is suitable for the proposed
development or what improvements must be undertaken to make it suitable.
      (5)   Police protection: In determining the suitability of land for
subdivision purposes, the distance that police would have to travel to respond
to a call for service shall be considered.
   (B)   Other requirements. Land proposed to be subdivided shall meet the
following requirements:
      (1)   Site must be in conformance with the Chatham Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   Development must not be located in a 100 year floodplain or flood
prone area.
      (3)   Development must not be located in any environmentally sensitive
area including sites adjacent to Lake Springfield and its tributaries unless
the subdivider can show that environmental concerns can be mitigated.
      (4)   Site must be of a shape, size and terrain so that usable lots and
streets in conformance with this chapter can and will be created.
      (5)   Development must not have a major conflict with existing use of
adjacent property (waste water treatment plants, power plants, major industrial
plants, landfills, certain agricultural uses, etc.) unless it is shown that
factors which cause the conflict can and will be mitigated.
      (6)   Development must not cause major off-site impacts and problems
relating to, but not limited to, streets, drainage, water supply and
distribution system, sanitary sewer collection system, parks. If it is
determined by the Planning Commission that major off-site impacts will result,
the subdivider must agree to mitigate the portion of the impact caused by the
subdivision. A traffic impact study, water network model, and/or a hydraulic
loading analysis of the sanitary collection system may be required to evaluate
the degree of off-site impacts, and to evaluate improvements that may be
required to mitigate impacts.
      (7)   When soils in the area to be developed have severe limitations for
building site development or sanitary facilities as determined by the USDA Soil
Conservation Service, the subdivider shall submit information indicating how
these limitations will be addressed.

prints to the Village Clerk for review according to the review schedule
established by the Planning Commission in accordance with §§
155.032,
155.033 and
155.034 no later than 35 months after the initial Village Board approval. If
the subdivider has submitted a final plat within said three year period, but it
is not approved during or after said three year period, the subdivider may
avoid expiration of the preliminary plan by making the same preliminary plan
reaffirmation submission described above, provided that if the disapproval of
the final plat occurs during or after the 35th month, the submission required
shall be made within one month of such disapproval. In such event, the review
process in §§
155.032,
155.033 and
155.034 shall be followed.
   (C)   Where reaffirmation of the preliminary plan is sought the Planning
Commission shall recommend, and the Village Board shall require, any changes in
the plan it deems necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. If the
subdivider has not resubmitted the preliminary plan with the required changes
to the Village Board within 30 days after the Village Board meeting requiring
changes, or if the resubmitted plan is disapproved, the plan shall expire at
that time or at the end of any appeal process provided for in this chapter,
whichever is later.
   (D)   A preliminary plan may be reaffirmed one time. If a final plat has not
been submitted to the Planning Commission within three years from the date of
the reaffirmation, or if submitted, is not approved, the plan shall expire.
   (E)   Final plat approval shall extend the validity of the preliminary plan
for three years from the date of final plat approval, provided that the
Planning Commission may require any changes necessary to meet the requirements
of this chapter, and in such an event, the provisions of division (C) of this
section with respect to resubmission shall apply. The preliminary plan may be
reaffirmed one time after each final plat approval. If another final plat has
not been resubmitted within three years from the date of the reaffirmation, the
preliminary plan shall expire. In the event a preliminary plan expires, a
subdivider wishing to proceed with subdivision of the land involved must
resubmit a location and sketch map for review and proceed as in the case of an
original submittal.

subdivider anticipates more than one final plat arising from an approved
preliminary plan, the subdivider shall submit, along with the construction
plans for any final plat, the drainage and detention plans for each watershed
that is affected by the construction of this final plat. If a watershed is
partially affected by any final plat, then the subdivider shall submit drainage
and detention plans for the entire watershed irrespective of whether the
watershed is located partially outside the plat. No final plat shall be
approved until all construction work is completed, or security is given for
construction, of drainage and detention works for all watersheds affected by
the final plat. Until all drainage works for the entire subdivision are built,
provisions shall be made in the construction plans if necessary for temporary
detention works for each plat as each plat is built.

§ 155.055 PARTIAL REDUCTION OF SECURITY.
   (A)   If at the time a final plat is submitted for approval or at any time
thereafter, the subdivider has already constructed a portion of the Subdivision
Improvements therein, the subdivider may request that the security for the
subdivision be based on 110% the estimated cost of the unconstructed portion.
This basis for establishing the amount of the security shall be used only if
the village’s consulting engineer has inspected the completed portion of the
Subdivision Improvements and certified that the improvements have been
constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans.
   (B)   No partial reduction or security shall be construed as final
acceptance by the village of any portion of the Subdivision Improvements; all
Subdivision Improvements constructed by the subdivider are subject to
reinspection and re-evaluation at any time prior to final acceptance thereof in
accordance with §
155.076 of this chapter, and the subdivider has a continuing obligation until
final acceptance to construct all Subdivision Improvements to the standards of
this chapter and the construction plans. In no event prior to final acceptance
shall the security for Subdivision Improvements be reduced to an amount less
than 12.5% of the initial estimated construction costs of all Subdivision
Improvements to be constructed for the final plat, net of any outstanding
separate security for sidewalks.

accepted by the Village Board (§
155.076), at which time the security shall be reduced to a minimum of 5% of the
original security amount. All Subdivision Improvements must be completed within
two years from the date when the security was approved. If Subdivision
Improvements (other than sidewalks subject to separate security) have not been
completed within said two years, the subdivider shall at the village’s option,
to be exercised at any time after expiration of the two-year period, forfeit
the security in the amount necessary for the village to carry out the
construction or repairs so that the Subdivision Improvements meet the standards
of this chapter, plus administrative costs involved.

   Local Street            27 feet minimum
      (2)   The minimum pavement width shall be 27 feet from the edge of
pavement to edge of pavement, not including the curb and gutter. Different
widths may be used depending on the anticipated traffic volumes and parking
demand. These widths of pavement shall be determined by the Planning Commission
and the village’s consulting engineer in consultation with the engineer for the
subdivider. If a pavement width narrower than the above stated minimum results
from this consultation, the subdivider shall install "No Parking" signs at his
expense.
   (E)   Curb and gutter.
      (1)   The standard curb and gutter required adjacent to flexible pavement
shall be a valley gutter type constructed of Portland cement concrete with the
following dimensions: 24" wide, 8" thick on the front face (pavement side), 10"
thick on the back face, 7" thick at center line (flow line), and a 10" radius
in the flow line, in accordance with Appendix A-12. The curb and gutter
adjacent to concrete pavement, if poured monolithically, may be limited to the
thickness of the pavement.
      (2)   All arterial roadways shall be constructed with a barrier type curb
and gutter similar to Type B6.18 as described in the State of Illinois,
Department of Transportation Highways Standards. Other locations where a
barrier type curb and gutter are required shall be determined by the engineer
for the subdivision and the village's consulting engineer.
      (3)   Expansion and contraction joints shall be constructed at the
intervals identified and in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois DOT
standard specifications.
   (F)   Pavement crown. The minimum crown used on all pavements shall be one
quarter inch per foot measured from the edge of the pavement to the centerline
of the street.
   (G)   Cul-de-sac streets. Local streets that are also cul-de-sac streets
shall be no more than 600 feet long unless necessitated by topography in which
case they shall be no longer than 1,000 feet unless provision is made for an
interim turnaround with a radius sufficient to accommodate emergency vehicles
and/or a median entrance (See division (J) of this section). A turnaround shall
be provided at the closed end having an outside roadway diameter of at least 86
feet edge to edge of pavement and a street right-of-way diameter of 110 feet.
No obstructions shall be permitted in the cul-de-sac turnaround.
   (H)   Corner "Knuckles". Widened areas or "knuckles" constructed at the
corners of local streets shall have a minimum edge of pavement radius of 45
feet.
   (I)   Stub streets. Access shall be provided to adjoining property not yet
subdivided. Proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of
such unsubdivided property. At the end of all temporary stub streets, a
barricade meeting the provisions of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices shall be installed by the subdivider. Stub streets in excess of
250 feet shall be provided with a temporary cul-de-sac with an outside roadway
diameter of at least 90 feet. The type of construction shall be determined by
the village's consulting engineer. The subdivider shall dedicate a temporary
easement to the appropriate street authority in the amount needed in excess of
the normally required right-of-way for the temporary turnaround. When the
street is extended in the future, the extra turnaround pavement shall be
removed and curb and gutters and sidewalks constructed by the subdivider who
constructed the temporary pavement or by the subsequent lot owner.
   (J)   Multiple access. Any area of development containing 70 or more single
family lots (or equivalent population) shall be served by two functioning
points of access. Where higher densities of development are proposed, a divided
type entrance roadway may suffice with a median of adequate width to ensure
continued emergency access lanes on one side. Depending on location and height
of nearby poles or trees, the required median width shall range between 12 and
30 feet. This type of roadway construction is intended to accommodate higher
density developments and not to lengthen the overall length of a cul-de-sac.
   (K)   Restriction of access. When a subdivision or a portion of it adjoins a
major or minor arterial, no lot shall have direct access to the arterial. The
lot shall have adequate depth for screen planting on the portion of the lot
contiguous to the major or minor arterial.
   (L)   Street names and street signs.
      (1)   A proposed street that is in alignment with and/or joins an
existing named street shall bear the name of the existing street. In no case
shall the proposed name of a street duplicate the name of an existing street
within the plat jurisdiction of this chapter. The use of the suffix "street",
"avenue", "boulevard", "driveway", "place", "court" or similar description
shall not be a distinction sufficient to constitute compliance with this
requirement.
      (2)   Street names signs shall be erected at all intersections within the
village's jurisdiction at the expense of the subdivider and shall be subject to
the specifications of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
The actual costs to install the street sign assemblies will be collected from
the developer at the time the developer requests village acceptance of the
streets.
   (M)   Private streets. There shall be no private streets platted in any
subdivision. Every subdivision lot shall be served from a publicly dedicated
street.
   (N)   Alleys. Alleys are not recommended in residential subdivisions unless
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission.
   (O)   Ramps. Where sidewalks cross a barrier type curb and gutter as
described in division (G) of this section, ramps shall be constructed to
accommodate the handicapped. These ramps shall be constructed to the lines and
grades shown on the standard sidewalk ramp example as shown in
Appendix A-5. Inlets for storm drainage shall not be located so that a
pedestrian way will be interrupted by the inlet grates.
   (P)   Typical street section. Refer to
Appendix A-5 for typical residential street section. For non-residential
streets, a pavement design shall be provided based on the anticipated loads
based on the projected average annual traffic volume.
   (Q)   Medians and islands.
      (1)   Where medians or islands are proposed they shall be constructed
with barrier curbing. All medians and islands shall be the responsibility of
the subdivider and/or a subdivision association to maintain. No sign may be
installed in the median which blocks the sight distance at the intersection. If
such a sign is to be installed, detailed plans for the sign shall be submitted
with the construction plans for approval. In no case shall an island or median
contain any other sign or structure except as may be placed for traffic control
under the direction of the village's consulting engineer.
      (2)   The subdivider or subdivision association may landscape medians or
islands. Ground cover may not exceed a maximum height of 12". Any additional
living plant material must be maintained to allow visibility across, over or
through medians and islands at a height of 3-10 feet above the adjacent roadway
pavements.

variation of 20 degrees to the southwest or 20 degrees to the southeast.
      (2)   Each lot shall front upon a public street.
      (3)   Flag lots shall be permitted only if the Planning Commission
determines that no public health and safety problems or additional costs or
difficulties providing municipal services will result.
      (4)   Through lots shall be permitted only when access is prohibited to
one street as described in §
155.092(J).
      (5)   All lots must contain sufficient buildable area.
      (6)   A minimum lot frontage requirement of 50 feet on all cul-de-sac and
corner “elbow” lots will be applied at the property line. The typical lot
layouts for cul-de-sacs and corner elbows are shown in Appendix 8 and Appendix
9 respectively.
   (C)   Sizes of blocks. Blocks shall not be less than 250 feet, nor more than
1,200 feet, in length measured along the greatest dimension of the enclosed
block area. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the Planning Commission may
require one or more public crosswalks with a right-of-way of not less than ten
feet in width to extend entirely across the block at locations deemed necessary
at intervals not closer than 400 feet.
   (D)   Survey monuments. All survey monuments shall be located and be made of
the appropriate material as required by state law.
   (E)   Lot grading.
      (1)   Trees that cannot be saved, stumps, boulders, and similar items

of the surrounding area. All street embankments shall be raised at least one
and one-half feet above the high water elevation.
      (3)   All building lots shall be graded or have natural slopes that will
properly allow surface drainage to flow away from the principal structures to
be located on the lot.
      (4)   Grading in the subdivision shall provide alternate drainage ways
for the purpose of carrying water away from homes and preventing damage during
periods of heavy rainfall.

§ 155.094 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   (A)   During construction of public improvements, measures shall be taken to
control erosion and sedimentation to insure that sediment will not be
transported from the site by a storm event of two- year frequency or less. The
erosion and sediment control plan shall include measures to stabilize and
protect disturbed areas, keep runoff velocities low, retain sediment on site
and protect disturbed areas from runoff. The location, type and configuration
of controls such as swales, berms, dams, sediment basins and release mechanisms
shall be included with the construction plans,
   (B)   Temporary or permanent soil stabilization measures, whichever is
applicable, shall be applied within 15 days after final grading to all areas
where the soil has been disturbed or the vegetative cover removed. Seeding
mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seed bed preparation, expected
seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer application and kind and
quantity of mulch for temporary or permanent vegetative control measures shall
be included with the construction plans.

§ 155.095 UTILITY EASEMENTS: LOCATION OF UTILITIES.
   (A)   Utility easements.
      (1)   Utility easements shall be provided along front, rear or side lot
lines for the purpose of erecting and maintaining one or more of the following
facilities: storm sewers, sanitary sewers, surface drainage, gas mains,
underground electric lines, telephone lines, cable TV and such other utilities
reasonably required for an urban structure.
      (2)   Easements shall be a minimum of ten feet in width. A utility may be
located in the street right-of-way if the respective company so desires and
appropriate permits have been obtained.
      (3)   Alternate locations for various utilities shall be decided upon by
the appropriate utility companies, subject to the approval of the village's
consulting engineer. In no case shall streets, permanent buildings, or other
man-made improvements that obstruct surface drainage be placed on rear or side
lot easements.
      (4)   It is the responsibility of the subdivider to notify all utility
companies in writing when the land to be developed has been graded in
accordance with the construction plans and is ready for installation of a given
utility.
   (B)   Location of utilities
      (1)   Utilities (sewers, electric, water and gas), whenever possible,
shall be located in the public right-of-way or front lot easement in the
following manner: water and electric lines shall be located on the south and
east sides; sanitary sewer and gas lines shall be located on the north and west
sides. In some cases, however, electric lines may also be located on the north
and west sides. Sanitary sewers shall be located in the front easement to allow
the placement of sanitary manholes as shown in
Appendix 10. In the event that a storm sewer manhole needs to be located in the
front easement, it will also be located as shown in
Appendix 10.
   FRONT YARD EASEMENT SOUTH OR EAST SIDE

   FRONT YARD EASEMENT NORTH OR WEST SIDE
      (2)   The placement of storm sewers or electric lines in the rear of a
lot is not acceptable unless circumstances determined by the village's
consulting engineer require their placement in the rear, in which case the
following easement diagrams indicate placement:
         (a)   Ten-foot easements. When an easement will not include sanitary
sewer or surface drainage systems, a ten foot easement width shall be
sufficient and the utilities shall be located as follows:

§ 155.096 SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE.
   (A)   All subdivisions shall be developed with adequate surface drainage.
Surface water drainage improvements shall consist of storm sewers and/or open
channels, inlets, catch basins, and manholes designed and constructed to
conform with standards established by the village’s consulting engineer and
shall adequately drain the area being developed, including drainage from other
areas which naturally drain through the areas being developed. Inlets and/or
catch basins shall be spaced so that water will not flow overland more than 500
feet and shall be located so that in no case will water be required to flow
across a street. Water shall not be retained outside the center ten feet of
drainage -- utility easement. Inlets covered by a metal grate shall have a
grate of a type that will not be hazardous to a bicyclist. All concrete end
sections for pipes less than 36 inches shall employ a grated cover to keep
animals and/or children from entering the pipe.
   (B)   If, as the result of subdivision development, surface water is
deposited in existing roadside ditches in quantities exceeding their capacity,
the developer shall improve the ditches and replace culverts as needed to
handle the flow.
   (C)   Unless engineering evidence is presented to the village's consulting
engineer warranting exceptions, storm sewers which will drain 20 acres or less
for residential development shall be designed and constructed to meet the
following criteria:
      Major and minor arterials - 10 year storm frequency
      All other areas - 5 year storm frequency
Storm sewer and pipe culvert materials shall be Class A reinforced concrete per
IDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, latest edition.
Exceptions may be allowed only in instances where the storm sewer is located
beneath a paved ditch and not subject to damage by utility installation, fence
posts or other anticipated construction activities on private properties.
Exceptions must be approved by the village's consulting engineer.
   (D)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide grade
control for rear lot drainage to each lot owner. At locations where back yards
abut other back yards or potential future back yards, a concrete swale shall be
constructed in an easement along the rear property line to provide grade
control and accommodate discharge from sump pumps. At locations where back
yards abut public roads, underdrains will be installed in an easement along the
rear or side property line to accommodate the discharge from sump pumps. At all
locations, the swales and the underdrains required by this section are will
rain into the storm sewer system constructed by the developer for the
subdivision. These swales and underdrains are not public works and they will
not be dedicated to an accepted by the village. Nevertheless, no construction
surety shall be fully released until the village’s consulting engineer has
approved the underdrains and/or the swales in the subdivision. Upon approval by
the village’s consulting engineer, it shall be the responsibility of each
adjoining lot owner to maintain the underdrains and swales to keep them free
from features that restrict natural drainage. All swales in residential
subdivisions shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete, five inches
thick, as indicated on the drawing entitled "paved ditch detail", Appendix
A-6. Exceptions may be made only when rear yard swales have longitudinal slopes
of 1% or greater. Swales in commercial subdivisions shall be approved by the
village engineer on a case-by-case basis based upon the characteristics of the
site. The underdrains installed will be six- inch to eight-inch pipe as
indicated on the drawing entitled “underdrain detail”, Appendix
A-6a.
   (E)   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff shall
be required in combination for all of the areas indicated on the preliminary
plan.
      (1)   The controlled release of storm water runoff shall not exceed the
release or discharge rate which existed at the site prior to development. This
rate shall be known as the predeveloped discharge rate. In the case of multiple
discharge locations, no location shall discharge at a rate higher than the pre-
developed discharge rate for that location under any set of conditions. The
controlled release rate in any case shall not exceed the rated capacity of the
existing natural downstream outlet channel or storm sewer system as determined
by the village's consulting engineer. The rate at which storm water runoff is
transported into a designated storage area may be as determined by the design
engineer and is unrestricted.
      (2)   A natural or surface channel system shall be designed with adequate
capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all tributary upstream areas
through the development. This by- pass channel shall be designed to carry the
peak rate of runoff from a 50-year storm assuming all storm sewers are blocked
and that the upstream areas are fully developed and have been saturated with
antecedent rainfall. No habitable structures shall be constructed within this
channel, however, streets and parking or playground areas and utility easements
shall be considered compatible primary uses.
      (3)   Storm water runoff capacity of detention facilities and discharge
rates from such facilities shall be calculated by analyzing volume and rate of
runoff during pre- and post-development conditions for the 10-year and the 100-
year recurrence intervals.
      (4)   Storage capacity and discharge rates shall be based on the maximum
calculated volume and peak flow of storm waters, respectively.
      (5)   Storage facilities shall be designed using the Soil Conservation
Service (SCS) method of calculating runoff discharge rate and total volume of
storage. The rational method of calculating runoff may be used for subdivisions
less than 20 acres.
      (6)   The storage volume shall be provided for the fully developed
watershed that is tributary to the area designated for detention purposes. The
control structure for discharge shall maintain the release rate at or below the
rate established in subdivision (1) for all rainfall events of 100-year or less
frequency.
      (7)   Detention reservoirs or bottom storm water storage areas shall be
designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types
of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent
flooding. A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains, and both shall be provided with a
positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or other storm sewer facility with
adequate capacity. The combination of storage of the water from a 100-year
storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in
excess of 72 hours. Maximum depths of planned storm-water storage shall not
exceed four feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other
conditions lend themselves to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by
the village's consulting engineer. Minimum grades for turf areas shall be 0.6%
and maximum slopes shall be ten percent. Storage area side slopes shall be kept
as close to the natural land contours as practical and a ten percent slope or
less shall be used whenever possible. If slopes greater than ten percent are
necessary to meet storage requirements or area restrictions, approval shall be
obtained from the village's consulting engineer, and suitable erosion control
shall be provided in addition to the protection required to insure public
health and safety.
      (8)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible
and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper
operation. Each storm water storage area shall be provided with a method of
emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year return
frequency storm occurs. The emergency overflow facility shall be designed to
function without maintenance and/or attention and shall become part of the
natural or surface channel system described in a preceding paragraph. Hydraulic
calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features. Both
outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities shall be designed
and constructed to fully protect the public health and safety. Storm water
runoff velocities shall be kept to a minimum and turbulent conditions at an
outfall control structure will not be permitted without complete protection for
the public safety. The use of restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and
shall be used only as a last resort when no other method is feasible.
      (9)   Retention reservoir or wet bottom storm water storage areas shall
be designed with all of the items required for detention reservoir storage
areas except that a low flow conduit and a system of drains with a positive
gravity outlet shall not be required. However, the following additional
conditions shall be complied with:
         (a)   Water surface area shall not exceed one-tenth of the tributary
drainage area.
         (b)   Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from
wave action.
         (c)   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to be
used to keep the pond clean, a minimum of one-fourth of the pond area shall be
a minimum of ten feet deep.
         (d)   Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond
level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline
maintenance.
         (e)   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed to
operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface water
level. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design
features.
         (f)   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be
provided, if necessary. Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness
of these aeration facilities shall be submitted with construction plans.
Agreement for the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities
shall be prepared to the satisfaction of the village's consulting engineer and
Planning Commission.
      (10) Where developments form only a portion of the watershed or contain
portions of several watersheds, the requirements for providing storage shall be
based upon that proportion of the area being developed as compared to the total
watershed tributary to the storage area. Compensating storage will be
acceptable whenever it is justified and feasible. As a watershed is developed
with a series of storm water storage facilities, due consideration will be
given for calculations of the allowable release rate and capacity of the
natural or surface channel system as described in §
155.096(E)(2).
      (11) Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash flood runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm
water runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earthmoving or drainage
construction on the project site.
      (12) The construction of the storm water control systems shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide certain benefits to the surrounding
properties, negotiations for public participation in the cost of such
development may be feasible.
      (13) The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge
capacity of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the storm water
runoff control system as provided in §
155.096(E)(7) shall give due consideration to providing ground water recharge
to compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground
surface is paved and/or roofed over. The use of natural gravel deposits for the
lower portions of storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes
and the retention of existing topography are samples of possible recharge
methods.
      (14) During the construction phase of land development, facilities shall
be provided by appropriate stock-pile design, to prevent the erosion and
washing away of the earth. Silting of downstream areas shall be prevented
through the strategic use of silting basins, sodding of runoff channels, and by
limiting the period of time during which the earth is stripped of vegetation.
      (15) Final engineering plans shall show complete details for all items
covered in this Section. Plans, specifications and all calculations for storm
water runoff control and storm sewers shall be submitted for review and
approval as part of the construction plan submittal or as part of the site plan
submittal for large scale developments.

one-half feet from and at least nine inches above the back of the curbs.
Sidewalks shall be located one foot inside the street right-of-way. Sidewalks
shall also be constructed along the side adjacent to the subdivision on all
streets bordering the subdivision. Along arterials and minor arterials, five-
foot wide sidewalks or ten-foot wide asphalt bike trails shall be required. The
determination to construct either sidewalks or bike trails along arterials and
minor arterials will be at the village’s sole discretion based, among other
things, upon anticipated vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic, planned
future bike trails and safety considerations. All walks at corner lots shall be
extended out to gutter(s) as per IDOT latest edition of the Illinois Department
of Transportation Highway Standards. The developer shall construct the ADA
sidewalk ramps as per IDOT latest edition of the Illinois Department of
Transportation Highway Standards on all corners at the time of street and curb
and gutter construction. If allowed and approved, the developer shall also
construct all mid-block and cul-de-sac sidewalk connections (running
perpendicular to the street and/or between two properties) at the time of
street and curb and gutter construction.

located and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or
neighborhood use as well as public service areas.
   (B)   When a proposed school, neighborhood park, electric substation, water
storage tank, recreation area, or public access to water frontage shown in the
Official Plan, is located in whole or part in a proposed subdivision, the
Village Board may require, as a condition of final plat approval, that such
space within the subdivision be reserved and not developed for a period not to
exceed one year from the date of such final plat approval. Within the one year
period, the appropriate public agency may acquire the reserved property in the
manner provided by law. If the reserved site is not acquired and no legal
action is filed within the one year period, the reservation shall become void
and the site previously reserved may then be used for other purposes.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 158.040 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPER. The person, firm or corporation proposing to develop the Planned
Unit Development. If such person is different from the owner of record, the
owner of record shall join in all submissions required by this chapter.
   NET DEVELOPMENT AREA. An arithmetic value determined for the purpose of
calculating the allowable number of dwelling units. The net development area
shall be determined by subtracting from the total planned unit development area
the area set aside for:
      (1)   Right of way;
      (2)   Churches;
      (3)   Schools;
      (4)   Commercial, offices, and other non-residential uses; or
      (5)   Water bodies except where the shoreline has been incorporated in
the common open space plan; provided that in no case shall the submerged land
constitute more than 10% of the net development area.
   OPEN SPACE. Land or water that is not built upon or used for parking and is
used for creation, conservation, or aesthetic purposes. To qualify as open
space under this chapter, the land:
      (1)   Must be owned in perpetuity by a homeowner or property owners'
association;
      (2)   Cannot be required side, rear or front yards;
      (3)   Cannot be a right-of-way or easement; and
      (4)   Must have guaranteed access.
   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. A subdivision or development having a PUD zoning
district classification that allows the development of ten or more acres of
land with variations of some of the restrictions of standard zoning and
subdivision regulations.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.041 PURPOSE.
   Traditional land development through subdivision is in general designed to
apply to individual lots, sometimes making innovative, creative, and efficient
land development more difficult than necessary. It is the purpose of a planned
unit development to provide innovation, creativity and efficiency by:
   (A)   Producing a development which would be as good as or better than
traditional development;
   (B)   Permitting developments which will provide a desirable and stable
environment in harmony with the surrounding area and in accord with adopted
plans for the village.
   (C)   Permitting flexibility that will encourage a more creative approach in
the development of land, which will result in a more efficient, aesthetic and
desirable integration of open space with housing and other land uses.
   (D)   Protecting and preserving scenic and natural features such as streams,
trees and topographic features.
   (E)   Permitting development of more energy efficient living areas by
encouraging bicycle and pedestrian circulation facilities which will reduce
reliance on automobiles, allowing for the proper orientation of streets, lots,
and buildings to facilitate current and future solar energy application, and in
general promoting a way of life that will lessen the consumption of scare
energy resources.
   (F)   Encouraging a more stable neighborhood by permitting a mixture of
housing types.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.042 PERMITTED USES.
   The planned unit development district allows all permitted uses and
conditional permitted uses in all districts of the Chatham Zoning Ordinance
except for the RM4, I-1 and I-2 Districts. The uses may be mixed if arranged in
such a way as to ensure compatibility among users.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.043 MINIMUM SIZE.
   The planned unit development must be at least ten acres in area and of
reasonable dimensions to allow a practical arrangement of improvements, open
spaces, and land uses.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.044 VARIANCE.
   The provisions or requirements of this chapter may be varied by the Village
Board upon application to the Planning Commission at the time of the
preliminary PUD application submission. The Planning Commission shall make
whatever recommendations it deems in the best interest of the village with
respect to the requested variance and the Village Board shall either approve or
reject such recommendation as a part of its approval of the planned unit
development zoning classification.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.045 MAXIMUM DENSITY.
   (A)   The aggregate residential densities within a planned unit development
shall not exceed 35 persons per acre of the net development area. Computation
of the net development area shall include public parks and open space.
Computation of the net development area shall not include non-residential areas
or rights-of-way. Water bodies will be included in the computation of the net
development area when the shorelines are incorporated in the common open space
plan; provided that in no case shall the submerged land constitute more than
10% of the net development area.
   (B)   To calculate the persons per acre of the net development area for
compliance with this density requirement, the following schedule of persons per
unit in single, duplex, and multiple family dwellings shall be used:
 
Bedrooms per dwellings unit in duplex and multiple family Persons per unit
dwellings
0 Bedroom                                                 1.0
1 Bedroom                                                 1.5
2 Bedrooms                                                2.4

exception. When a PUD classification has been granted, the approved site plans
and supporting documentation shall control use of land, regulate the spacing
and height structures, control use of signs, and outline any deviations from
the zoning and subdivision regulations of the village. Where no indication or
exception is given to the zoning or subdivision regulations of the village, the
requirements of the appropriate section of the zoning or subdivision
regulations shall apply.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.047 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   To assist developers in the preparation of a planned unit development, a
pre-application conference with the Zoning Administrator may be requested by
the developer. The purpose of the meeting will be to ensure that the developer
fully understands the procedures and required submissions necessary for
obtaining a PUD zoning classification as well as to make an initial assessment
as to the suitability of the site for a PUD. The Zoning Administrator shall
point out any potential problems that might be anticipated and make suggestions
for their resolution, if resolution is possible. Within ten days following the
conference, the Zoning Administrator shall inform the developer in writing to
proceed with the Conceptual PUD submission. If the Zoning Administrator has
ascertained that there are problems with the site, he shall so inform the
developer in his letter and make clear that the problem or problems must be
addressed before approval of the PUD submission and resolved prior to
Preliminary Plan approval by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.048 CONCEPTUAL PUD SUBMISSION.
   (A)   The first stage of the PUD process is submission of a conceptual
submission consisting of the location map, along with a narrative describing
the developer's plans for the planned unit development including, but not
limited to:
      (1)   A general description of the proposed site;
      (2)   The overall concept for development, including the type of land
uses to be included, their approximate location, and the approximate percentage
of the development that the land uses will occupy;
      (3)   A preliminary sketch of automobile and pedestrian circulation
systems; and
      (4)   The availability and adequacy of utilities to serve the
development.
   (B)   The purposes of the conceptual PUD submission is:
      (1)   To enable the technical personnel of the village to formally
address the adequacy of utilities to serve the site;
      (2)   To make a preliminary assessment of the impact of the planned unit
development of the vicinity and the village as a whole;
      (3)   Insure that the proposal is in accord with the official village
plan; and
      (4)   To determine if the proposed planned unit development is in accord
with the purposes of the PUD District.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.049 REVIEW OF CONCEPTUAL PUD SUBMISSION.
   (A)   The owner/developer shall submit to the Zoning Administrator 12 copies
of the location map and other required submissions. The Planning Commission

§ 158.059 MINIMUM DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   The uniqueness of each proposal for a planned unit development allows
that the requirements for the public improvements serving the development and
for the location of the building in the development are subject to modification
from the requirements of the prevailing land subdivision regulations.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may, therefore, recommend waivers or
modifications of such requirements if it finds that the requirements are not
necessary for the best interest of the residents of the development and that
such action is not inconsistent with the interest of the entire village. No
such modification shall be less than the standards indicated below. Where no
indication or exception is given in the PUD zoning district classification, the
requirements shall be as stated in the appropriate portion of the land
subdivision regulations except that for private ways the requirements for the
ways shall be only as noted below:
      (1)   Off street parking.
         (a)   A minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided
as follows:

street shall have a dedicated additional right-of-way, if needed, to meet the
minimum street width requirements called for on the official street and
thoroughfare plan of the village. The entire additional right-of-way shall be
provided where the PUD is on both sides of the existing street. When the PUD is
located on one side of the street, one-half of the right-of-way shall be
provided. However, in no case shall the resulting right-of-way be less than 50
feet.
         (c)   When a PUD or portion thereof adjoins a major thoroughfare, as
indicated on the official street and thoroughfare plan, access shall be
reasonably restricted so that ingress or egress to the major thoroughfares
shall occur at 400 foot intervals or longer. Residential lots and business and

subdivision with the approval of the village engineer.
      (5)   Sidewalks shall be provided to permit easy pedestrian movement
throughout the development. Sidewalks need not be located adjacent and parallel
to the public streets but shall be provided to meet pedestrian desires or
needs. Sidewalks located along public streets, and within or leading to
dedicated open spaces from public streets, shall be considered as public
sidewalks, provided they are located on dedicated right-of-way or easements and
constructed in accordance with the subdivision ordinance.
      (6)   Public sanitary sewers shall be provided to serve all platted
building lots and be located on public street right-of-way or dedicated utility
easement a in accordance with the subdivision ordinance.

NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND,
NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES AND
NON-CONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE
§ 158.090 INTENT.
   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter and amendments that
may later be adopted there exist: lots; structures; uses of land and
structures; and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed,
damaged in excess of 50% of the value of the structure, or changed to a
conforming use, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent
of this chapter that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expended or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
   (B)   Non-conforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a
structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non- conforming use of structure
and a land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of
this chapter by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved.
   (C)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal
of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
(Ord. 96-54, passed 3-26-96)
§ 158.091 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a
single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Board of Appeals.
   (B)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in this chapter.

provided:
   (A)   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (B)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.

§ 158.093 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendments of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (A)   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its non-conformity.
   (B)   Should such existing non-conforming business or industrial non-
conforming structure or non-conforming portion of structure be destroyed by any
means to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. (Residential structures or the residential portion
of a business or industrial structures are excepted from the 50% portion of a
business or industrial structures are excepted from the 50% provision).

COMBINATION.
   If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
$3,000 or more, or of structure and premises in combinations, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be
allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be

based upon the division of the village into districts, within any one of which
the use of land, buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings or
structures, as related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized,
however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique character,
cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those use. upon neighboring lands
and upon public need for the particular use of the particular location. Such
special uses fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly-regulated utilities,
or uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation. A written petition for a special use may be made by any
person, firm, or corporation who is the owner of real estate for which such
special use is sought, requesting or intending to request application for a
special use.

more newspapers in general circulation within the village not more than 30 days
nor less than 15 days prior to the hearing, and (c) by mailing a written notice
before the hearing to the owners of the properties located adjacent to the
location for which the special use is requested. Failure to comply with (a) and
(c) shall not void the special use.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall make a finding on the request and
shall submit a recommendation to the Village Board for decision.
   (D)   Findings. Before any special use shall be recommended to the Village
Board, the Planning Commission shall make written findings certifying that the
special use:
      (1)   Is proposed to be operated, designed, and located so that the
public health, safety and welfare will be protected; and
      (2)   Will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in
the vicinity in which it is located.
   (E)   Decisions. The Village Board, after receiving the finding and
recommendation and minutes of the Planning Commission and without further
public hearing, may grant or deny by majority vote the proposed special use or

governing the district in which it is located;
         (b)   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
         (c)   That the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals, in making the foregoing determination
may take into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable
to the applicant, have been established by the evidence:
         (a)   That the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved would bring a
particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of regulation were to be carried out;

based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same
zoning classification;

desire to make more money out of the property;
         (d)   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property;

public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
         (f)   That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (3)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may require such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the
injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood, and
to implement the general purpose and intent of this chapter.

prohibited solely because of insufficient area of the lot.

spaces for two or more uses, provided that the maximum use of such facility by
each user does not take place during the same hours of the same days of the
week.

requirements.
      (7)   To authorize a use of land where an amendment to the village zoning
district classification causes practical difficulties or hardships.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 159.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this
chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas;
   (B)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas;
   (C)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
   (D)   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a
primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
   (E)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
   (F)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful
design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
   (G)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently;
   (H)   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and
   (I)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of
these goals, the village shall give due consideration to its comprehensive
plan, zoning map, existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
(Ord. 99-14, passed 3-23-99)
§ 159.02 RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING ORDINANCE.
   This chapter is closely related to and shall be interpreted together with
the Zoning Chapter,
Chapter 158. All terms contained in this chapter shall have the same meanings
as when used in
Chapter 158, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. However, in the
event of any conflict between this chapter and
Chapter 158, this chapter shall control.

(Ord. 99-14, passed 3-23-99; Am. Ord. 18-40, passed 7-10-18)
§ 159.05 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses under the zoning chapter. A different
existing use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the
installation of an antenna or tower on such lot.
   (B)   Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zoning district regulations, including but not
limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
   (C)   Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing
towers, antennas or sites approved for towers or antennas that are either
within the jurisdiction of the village or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design
of each tower. The Zoning Administrator may share such information with other
applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under
this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the
jurisdiction of the village, provided, however, that the Zoning Administrator
is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that
such sites are available or suitable.
   (D)   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
      (2)   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and
landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
      (3)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   (E)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
   (F)   State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state
or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If
such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this chapter shall bring the towers and antennas into
compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.
   (G)   Building codes: safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
village concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards
and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the
tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
   (H)   Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this chapter and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities or private utilities.
   (I)   Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify, that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the village have been obtained
and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Zoning Administrator.
   (J)   Public notice. For purposes of this chapter, any special use request,
variance request, or appeal of an administratively approved use or special use
shall require public notice to all abutting property owners and all property
owners of properties that are located within the corresponding separation
distance listed in §
159.17(B)(5)(b), Table 2, in addition to any notice otherwise required by the
Zoning Ordinance.
   (K)   Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.
   (L)   Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of §
159.17.
   (M)   Multiple antenna/tower plan. The village encourages the users of
towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of multiple
towers and/or antenna sites. Applications for approval of multiple sites shall
be given priority in the review process.
(Ord. 99-14, passed 3-23-99)
USES
§ 159.15 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted
uses and shall not require administrative approval or a special use permit.
   (B)   Permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted:
      (1)   Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise
controlled by the village, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna
or tower has been approved by the village.
(Ord. 99-14, passed 3-23-99)
§ 159.16 ADMINISTRATIVELY APPROVED USES.
   (A)   General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
administrative approvals for towers and antennas.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator may administratively approve the uses
listed in this section.
      (2)   Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the
Zoning Administrator providing the information set forth in §
159.17(B)(1) and (3) and a non-refundable fee of $250 to reimburse the village
for the costs of reviewing the application.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the application for
administrative approval and determine if the proposed use complies with §§
159.05,
159.17(B)(4) and (B)(5).
      (4)   The Zoning Administrator shall respond to each such application
within 60 days after receiving it by either approving or denying the
application. If the Zoning Administrator fails to respond to the applicant
within the 60 days, then the application shall be deemed to be approved.
      (5)   In connection with any such administrative approval, the Zoning
Administrator may, in a case involving shared use, administratively waive any
zoning district setback requirements in §
159.17(B)(4) or separation distances between towers in §
159.17(B)(5) by up to 50%.
      (6)   In connection with any such administrative approval, the Zoning
Administrator may, in order to encourage the use of monopoles, administratively
allow the reconstruction of an existing tower to monopole construction.
      (7)   If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant's
administrative remedy shall be limited to filing an application for a special
use permit pursuant to §
159.17.
   (B)   List of administratively approved uses. The following uses may be
approved by the Zoning Administrator after conducting an administrative review.
      (1)   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or
antenna, in any industrial zoning district.
      (2)   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with
the terms of (a) and (b) below.
         (a)   Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the Zoning Administrator as an accessory
use to any commercial, industrial, professional, institutional, or multi-family
structure of eight or more dwelling units, provided:
            1.   The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the
highest point of the structure;
            2.   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations; and
            3.   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
         (b)   Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to an
existing tower may be approved by the Zoning Administrator and, to minimize
adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers
shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such
collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
            1.   A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Zoning Administrator allows reconstruction as a
monopole.
            2.   Height.
               a.   An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller
height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height, to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna.
               b.   The height change referred to in division (B)(2)(b)2.a.
above may only occur one time per communication tower.
               c.   The additional height referred to in division (B)(2)(b)2.a.
above shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in §
159.17. The tower's premodification height shall be used to calculate such
distance separations.
            3.   Onsite location.
               a.   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite within 50 feet of its
existing location.
               b.    After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation,
only one tower may remain on the site.
               c.   A relocated onsite tower shall continue to be measured from
the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances
between towers pursuant to §
159.17(B)(5). The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to
cause a violation of § 159.017(B)(5).
               d.   The onsite relocation of a tower which comes within the
separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as
established in §
159.17(B)(5) shall only be permitted when approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   New towers in non-residential zoning districts. Locating any new
tower in a non- residential zoning district other than industrial provided a
licensed professional engineer certifies the tower can structurally accommodate
the number of shared users proposed by the applicant; the Zoning Administrator
concludes the tower is in conformity with the goals set forth in §
159.01 and the requirements of §
159.05; the tower meets the setback requirements in §
159.17(B)(4) and separation distances in §
159.17(B)(5); and the tower meets the following height and usage criteria:
         (a)   For a single user, up to 90 feet in height;
         (b)   For two users, up to 120 feet in height; and
         (c)   For three or more users, up to 150 feet in height.
      (4)   Installing a cable microcell network through the use of multiple
low powered transmitters/receivers attached to existing wireline systems, such
as conventional cable or telephone wires, or similar technology that does not
require the use of towers.
(Ord. 99-14, passed 3-23-99)
§ 159.17 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special
use permits for towers or antennas by the Planning Commission:
      (1)   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under §
159.15 or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to §
159.16, then a special use permit shall be required for the construction of a
tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
      (2)   Applications for special use permits under this section shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, except as
modified in this section.
      (3)   In recommending the grant of a special use permit, the Planning
Commission may suggest conditions to the extent the Planning Commission
concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the
proposed tower on adjoining properties.
      (4)   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant
submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a
licensed professional engineer.
      (5)   An applicant for a special use permit shall submit the information
described in this section and a non-refundable fee of $250 plus a commitment to
reimburse the village its out-of-pocket costs for a review by a licensed
engineer.

proposed new tower.
         (k)   A description of the feasible location(s) of future towers or
antennas within the village based upon existing physical, engineering,
technological or geographical limitations in the event the proposed tower is
erected.
      (2)   Factors considered in granting special use permits for towers. In
addition to the standards for consideration of special use permit applications
pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to recommend issuance of a special use
permit, although the Planning Commission may recommend waiver or reduction of
the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the Planning
Commission concludes that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby:
         (a)   Height of the proposed tower;
         (b)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
         (c)   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         (d)   Surrounding topography;
         (e)   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         (f)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         (g)   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         (h)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in §
159.17(B)(3).
      (3)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be recommended unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Planning Commission
related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
         (a)   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         (b)   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         (c)   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
         (d)   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
         (e)   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
         (f)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
         (g)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
      (4)   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the
Planning Commission may recommend reduction of the standard setback
requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby.
         (a)   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75% of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
         (b)   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
      (5)   Separation.   The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Planning Commission may reduce the standard separation
requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby.
         (a)   Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
            1.   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in
Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1.
            2.   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 1.

§ 163.03 REGULATION OF SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES.
   (A)   Permitted use. Small wireless facilities shall be classified as
permitted uses and subject to administrative review, except as provided in
division (B)(9) below regarding height exceptions or variances, but not subject
to zoning review or approval if they are collocated (i) in rights-of-way in any
zoning district, or (ii) outside rights-of-way in property zoned exclusively
for commercial or industrial use.
   (B)   Permit required. An applicant shall obtain one or more permits from
the village to collocate a small wireless facility. An application shall be
received and processed, and permits issued shall be subject to the following
conditions and requirements:
      (1)   Application requirements. A wireless provider shall provide the
following information to the village, together with the village's small cell
facilities permit application, as a condition of any permit application to
collocate small wireless facilities on a utility pole or wireless support
structure:
         (a)   Site specific structural integrity and, for a municipal utility
pole, make-ready analysis prepared by a structural engineer, as that term is
defined in Section 4 of the Structural Engineering Practice Act of 1989;
         (b)   The location where each proposed small wireless facility or
utility pole would be installed and photographs of the location and its
immediate surroundings depicting the utility poles or structures on which each
proposed small wireless facility would be mounted or location where utility
poles or structures would be installed. This should include a depiction of the
completed facility;
         (c)   Specifications and drawings prepared by a structural engineer,
as that term is defined in Section 4 of the Structural Engineering Practice Act
of 1989, for each proposed small wireless facility covered by the application
as it is proposed to be installed;
         (d)   The equipment type and model numbers for the antennas and all
other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility;
         (e)   A proposed schedule for the installation and completion of each
small wireless facility covered by the application, if approved; and
         (f)   Certification that the collocation complies with the collocation
requirements and conditions contained herein, to the best of the applicant's
knowledge.
         (g)   In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be
attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the village, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application process. The village shall process applications as
follows:
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the
village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no
sooner than 75 days after the submission of a completed application. The permit
shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th day after submission of the
complete application or the tenth day after the receipt of the deemed approved
notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not
preclude the village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as
provided under this chapter.
         (c)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or
deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed
application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
105 days after the submission of a completed application. The permit shall be
deemed approved on the latter of the one hundred twentieth day after submission
of the complete application or the tenth day after the receipt of the deemed
approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall
not preclude the village's denial of the permit request within the time limits
as provided under this chapter.
         (d)   The village shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this chapter. If the village determines that applicable codes,
ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation
requirements and conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or
wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation,
approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or
wireless support structure at the cost of the provider. The village shall
document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or
application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the documentation
to the applicant on or before the day the village denies an application. The
applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the village and resubmit the
revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the
applicant without paying an additional application fee. The village shall
approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the applicant
resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the
revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the application to
submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the
village's review period. The applicant must notify the village in writing of
its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved
basis, which may be submitted with the revised application.
            Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the
village and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement,
provided by the village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole
by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant
shall enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an
application, the village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in
the village's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the
village. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
village; or
         (b)   A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the
collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless
facility and substantially the same type of structure. If an application
includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may remove small
wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small
wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been
provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied.
The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in
a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter. If
the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits
shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      (7)   Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the village by personal
delivery at the village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
   (C)   Collocation requirements and conditions.
      (1)   Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970
through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The village may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations
cited above in this division (C)(3). Failure to remedy the interference as
required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole. However, the antenna and support
equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications
space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise
unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work
involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this division (C)(4), the terms
COMMUNICATIONS SPACE, COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY
ZONE have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety
Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (6)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable
stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village
ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other
written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (7)   Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions division (C), a wireless provider shall not be
required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole,
or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna
systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for
the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility
pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on
an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet
of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the
right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and
the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or
additional material costs as determined by the applicant. If the applicant
refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide
written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or
material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in
this division (C)(7).
      (8)   Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or
replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
         (b)   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with and utilizing the same
procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the village's Development
Ordinance.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and
a private property owner that concern design or construction standards
applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-
of-way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application
to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless facility addressed
in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless
facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures.
      (2)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of
a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The village shall not require an application, approval or permit,
or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with §
163.03(B)(1)(d); or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      (3)   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section l8c-7201

other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in
Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/16-102), without the
consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility.
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an electric or gas public
utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used,
developed and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of
Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/16-1805(i)). For the
purposes of this division (E)(3), PUBLIC UTILITY has the meaning given to that
term in Section 3-105 of the  Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/3-105). Nothing
in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement
(a) to obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable
service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install,
place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small
wireless facilities subject to this chapter.
   (F)   Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities

village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, for all small wireless
facilities collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination
provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall
comply with this chapter. A wireless provider that has an existing agreement
with the village on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees
and terms that the village makes available under this chapter for the
collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility
poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of
an application submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act
by notifying the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The
existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination
provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has
collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to
the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its
option under this division (F).
   (G)   Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (i) $200 per year or (ii)
the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use
of space on the village utility pole. If the village has not billed the
wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be $200 payable on the
first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or
notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   (H)   Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the
facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt
of written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery. A wireless provider shall provide
written notice to the village if it sells or transfers small wireless
facilities within the jurisdiction of the village. Such notice shall include
the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.
(Ord. 18-40, passed 7-10-18)
§ 163.04 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Sangamon County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than $200 per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to
be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 18-40, passed 7-10-18)
§ 163.05 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the village harmless against
any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
(Ord 18-40, passed 7-10-18)
§ 163.06 INSURANCE.
   (A)   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      (1)   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      (2)   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
   (B)   The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. A wireless provider
may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit
requirement required by the village. A wireless provider that self-insures is
not required, to the extent of the self insurance, to comply with the
requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section.
   (C)   A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage limits required by the village.
(Ord. 18-40, passed 7-10-18)
§ 163.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be
given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid
provision or invalid application of this chapter is severable.
