No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance

ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party affected, applied to
any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as abating any action now
pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the City herein repealed
and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code shall be
deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same
provision; nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,

City under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this City Code. (1992 Code)
Neither the adoption of this Code nor the repeal hereby of any ordinance of
this City shall in any manner be construed as a waiver of any license at the

affecting any of the provisions of such ordinance relating to the collection of
any such license or the penal provisions applicable to any violation thereof
nor to affect the validity of any bond or cash deposit in lieu thereof required

hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the
fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs,

it shall be stated by the presiding officer before debate, and every motion in
the Council, except motions of procedure, shall be reduced to writing, if
required by a member, and the member who proposed the motion shall be entitled
to the floor.

the motion, he may do so. The seconder of the motion may renew the motion as
its maker and seek a new seconder. If the seconder of a motion wishes to
withdraw his second, he may do so. The maker of the motion may seek an
additional seconder before the motion is ruled out of order for lack of a
second. Neither the maker nor seconder of a motion may withdraw the motion,
except with the consent of a majority of the Council, once discussion on the
motion has ceased.

be deemed concluded, and during the taking of the vote, a member shall be
permitted briefly to explain his vote and shall respond to the calling of his
name by the Clerk by answering "yea" or "nay" or "abstain", as the case may be.
      2.   Announcement and Changes of Votes: The result of all votes by "yeas"
and "nays" shall not be announced by the Clerk but shall be handed by him to

   R.   Precedence of Motions: The following chart sets out commonly used
motions in the order of their precedence as determined by "Robert's Rules of
Order Revised". The main or principal motion is at the bottom in rank. The
other motions may be made while the main motion is pending and must be dealt
with before the main motion. They are arranged according to rank, the highest
at the top of the list. Incidental motions, however, have no rank among
themselves, yet take precedence over subsidiary motions. When any one motion is
immediately pending, the motions above it on the list are in order and those
below are out of order.

      5.   Motion to Refer: A motion to refer to a standing committee shall
take a precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.
      6.   Motion to Amend:
         a.   A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to
amend an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained.
         b.   An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in
order, but an amendment relating to a different subject shall not be in order.
         c.   On an amendment to "strike out and insert" the paragraph to be
amended shall first be read as it stands, then the word proposed to be stricken
out, then those to be inserted and finally, the paragraph as it will stand if

      1.   A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same

reconsideration, once having been made and decided in the negative, shall not
be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered. No motion to
reconsider the approval or denial of the recommendation of an advisory body
required to hold public hearings shall be entertained except at the same
meeting at which the original action was taken or after the matter has been
referred to the advisory body for a further hearing and recommendation. Where a
motion to reconsider such a motion is made at the same meeting as the passage
of the original motion, it may be tabled to a later date certain.
      2.   A motion to reconsider must be made by a member who voted on the
prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless otherwise provided
by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received a majority vote in
the affirmative but is declared lost solely on the ground that a greater number
of affirmative votes are required by statute for the passage or adoption of
such motion, then, in such case, a motion to reconsider may be made only by
those who voted in the affirmative on such question. A motion to reconsider
need not be seconded. (Ord. O-09-91, 4-15-91)

1-9H-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this policy is as follows:
   A.   To provide all employees with notice of the provisions of the City of
Northlake Drug Testing Program.
   B.   To provide and maintain a safe, healthy working environment for all
City employees.
   C.   To safeguard the reputation of the City and its employees as good,
responsible citizens worthy of the trust of the people, businesses and agencies
for whom they provide services.
   D.   To reduce the incidence of accidental injury to person or property.
   E.   To reduce absenteeism, tardiness and poor job performance. (Ord. 0-17-
94, 6-6-94)
1-9H-2: POLICY:
   A.   It is the policy of the City that our mission of service to the
citizens of the City justifies maintenance of a drug-free work environment
through the use of a reasonable employee drug testing program. The public has a
right to expect that those who are employed to serve them are at all times both
physically and mentally prepared to assume these duties. There is sufficient
evidence to conclude that the use of controlled substances, and other forms of
drug abuse will seriously impair an employee's physical and mental health, and
thus, their job performance.
   B.   Where City employees participate in illegal drug use and drug activity,
the integrity of the City and public confidence in them are destroyed. This
confidence is further eroded by the potential for corruption created by drug
use.
   C.   Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the City and to preserve
public trust and confidence in a fit and drug-free work environment, the City
shall implement a drug testing program to detect prohibited drug use by City
employees. (Ord. 0-17-94, 6-6-94)

perception, pain level or judgment of the individual consuming it.
ILLEGAL DRUG: Any drug or controlled substance, the sale or consumption of
which is illegal.
PRESCRIBED DRUG: Any substance prescribed for the individual consuming it by a
licensed medical practitioner.
REASONABLE SUSPICION: An articulable belief based on specific objective facts
and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts.
UNDER THE INFLUENCE: Having the presence of an illegal drug or alcohol at or
above the level of a positive test result, or having the presence of a
prescribed or over-the-counter drug in an amount contrary to the instructions

underlying the determination of reasonable suspicion shall be disclosed to the
employee at the time the demand for a test is made.
   D.   All noncontractual City employees shall be subject to mandatory random

1-9H-8: SUPERVISOR/DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR TRAINING:
The City shall develop a program of training to assist supervisory personnel in
identifying drug and alcohol use among employees. Such training will be
directed toward helping supervisors to recognize the conduct and behavior
giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use, to identify

enclosure so that employees and applicants may not be viewed while providing
the sample. Bags, briefcases, purses and other containers may not be carried

protect against dilution of test samples. (Ord. 0-17-94, 6-6-94)
1-9H-10: CONSENT:

   A.   Upon the first confirmed determination that an employee has been under
the influence of drugs or alcohol, the City shall refer the employee to an
Employee Assistance Program for assessment, counseling and rehabilitation
unless the employee's drug or alcohol use has resulted in an accident serious
enough to warrant dismissal. Participation in an EAP is voluntary and no
disciplinary action may be taken against an employee for failure to begin or
complete an EAP program. Disciplinary action based on a violation of the City's
drug and alcohol policy is not automatically suspended by an employee's
participation in an EAP and may be imposed when warranted.

result is encouraged. No disciplinary action will be brought as a result of
volunteering to participate in such a program. Employees who, prior to a

can be disciplined for any incidents resulting from their violation of the
City's policy on drug and alcohol abuse. (Ord. 0-17-94, 6-6-94)

Against An Elected Official By An Elected Official
1-9J-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Northlake, Illinois to prohibit
harassment of any person by any Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal
employee or Municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All
Municipal officials, Municipal agents, Municipal employees and Municipal
agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person,
regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. O-22-2018, 11-
5-2018)
1-9J-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct
of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment,
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      1.   Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      2. Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   C.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person". (Ord. O-22-2018, 11-5-2018)
1-9J-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following:
   A.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing behavior
in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express
her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending
behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are
needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
   B.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
Director of Human Resources, an Ethics Officer, the City Manager or
Administrator, or the Chief Executive Officer of the Municipality.
   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment
must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no
witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible
officer, the Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
   C.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all Municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the Municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. O-22-2018, 11-5-2018)
1-9J-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or Municipal
agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any Municipal
employee due to a Municipal employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy,
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   B.   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a Municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act1 provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.    Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2, an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other
proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation3.
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4, it is a civil rights
violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate
against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in
good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act. An
employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a
promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation
charge - due within three hundred (300) days (IDHR) or three hundred (300) days
(EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. O-22-2018, 11-5-2018)
1-9J-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute' a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an Ethics Commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a State or Federal agency. (Ord. O-22-2018, 11-5-2018)
1-9J-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an Ethics Commission, an Inspector General, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. O-22-2018, 11-5-2018)

AGAINST AN ELECTED OFFICIAL BY AN ELECTED OFFICIAL:
   A.   Pursuant to Section 70-5 of the Act, elected City officials are
encouraged to promptly report claims of sexual harassment by another elected
official. Every effort should be made to file such complaints as soon as

the elected official feels comfortable doing so, he or she should directly
inform the harassing individual that the individual's conduct or communication
is offensive and must stop.   
   B.   Elected officials should report claims of sexual harassment against an
alderman to the Mayor or the City Clerk. If the report is made to the Mayor,
the Mayor shall promptly notify the City Clerk. If the Mayor is the subject of
the complaint, the City Clerk shall notify the most senior alderman. If the
report is made to the City Clerk, the City Clerk shall promptly notify the
Mayor. If the City Clerk is the subject of the complaint, the Mayor shall
notify the most senior alderman. Reports of sexual harassment will be
confidential to the greatest extent possible.    
   C.   When a complaint of sexual harassment is made against an elected
official, the Mayor shall appoint a qualified law firm that has experience in
workplace investigations to conduct an independent review of the allegations.
If the allegations concern the Mayor, or the Mayor is a witness or otherwise
conflicted, the City Clerk shall make the appointment. If the allegations
concern both the Mayor and the City Clerk and/or they are both witnesses or
otherwise conflicted, the senior most alderman shall make the appointment. The
investigator shall prepare a written report and submit it to the Mayor and the
City Council.   
   D.   If the investigator finds that the elected official that is the subject
of the investigation has engaged in sexual harassment, the finding shall be

   A.   Authority Of Local Liquor Control Commissioner: The local liquor

suspend any license issued under the provisions of this chapter, if he
determines that the licensee has violated any of the provisions of the liquor
control act, this chapter or any other ordinance or resolution enacted by the
corporate authorities of the city, or any applicable rules or regulations
established by the local liquor control commissioner or the Illinois liquor
control commission or any state and/or federal statute which is not
inconsistent with the law. In lieu of suspension or revocation, the local
liquor control commissioner may instead levy a fine on the licensee for such
violations. The fine imposed shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
for each violation; each day on which a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. Not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in fines
under this section may be imposed against any licensee during the period of his
license. However, no such license shall be revoked or suspended nor shall any
licensee be fined except after a public hearing by the local liquor control
commissioner after a three (3) day written notice to the licensee, and, if the
licensee leases the premises, to the lessor under the lease at the address for
notice provided in the lease, affording the licensee and lessor an opportunity
to appear and defend the charges contained in such notice.
If the local liquor control commissioner has reason to believe that any
continued operation of a particular licensed premises will immediately threaten
the welfare of the community, he may, upon the issuance of a written order
stating the reason for such conclusion and without notice or hearing, order the
licensed premises closed for not more than seven (7) days, giving the licensee
and the lessor, if any, an opportunity to be heard during that period; except
that if the licensee is also engaged in another business on the licensed
premises, such order shall not be applicable to such other business.
The local liquor control commissioner shall, within five (5) days after such
hearing, if he determines after such hearing that the license should be revoked
or suspended, or that the licensee should be fined, state the reason for such
determination in a written order of revocation, suspension or fine and serve a
copy of such order within five (5) days upon the licensee and lessor, if any.
235 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/7-7, 5/7-9, 5/7-12 and 5/7-13 of the liquor
control act are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
chapter.
All review or any appeal of the actions or orders of the local liquor control
commissioner shall be made to the Illinois liquor control commission on the
official record made before the local liquor control commissioner as provided
for in 235 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/7-9 of the liquor control act.
   B.   Revocation Upon Conviction Of Violation: Whenever any licensee shall
have been convicted by any court of a violation of any of the provisions of the
liquor control act, or of this chapter or any other ordinance of the city
controlling or regulating the sale of alcoholic liquor, the licensee may, in
addition to all other penalties for such offense, incur a forfeiture of any

that may have been paid therefor.

and license holder shall have the burden of providing the local liquor control
commissioner with satisfactory evidence that said insurance is in full force
and effect at any particular time during the term of any such license. Failure

3-4D-5: Registration

3-4D-7: License Required; Fees
3-4D-1: FINDINGS:
The Mayor and City Council make the following findings:
   A.   It is uncontested that the City may regulate, through its zoning power,
the location of sexually explicit businesses;
   B.   Zoning, when used to preserve the character of the residential and
commercial areas of the City, is perhaps the most essential function performed
by the City;
   C.   The City is predominately a single-family residential community with
approximately seventy percent (70%) of the total land area of the City zoned
and used for residential, school, park, cemetery and governmental purposes;
   D.   The Board of Appeals-Plan Commission held a public hearing, reviewed
the experiences of other municipalities, counties and units of local government
relative to adult uses;
   E.   The City is only about three (3) square miles in size and there are
many locations available for adult uses in the larger, immediately surrounding
communities, such as the City of Chicago, unincorporated Cook County and in
other municipalities;
   F.   The proposed regulation of adult uses serves a substantial governmental
interest, while allowing for reasonable alternative avenues of communication;
   G.   The Illinois Supreme Court has judicially confirmed that the regulation
of adult uses serves a valid governmental interest;
   H.   The proposed regulations are not aimed at the content of adult
entertainment, but at the secondary effects associated with it including, but
not limited to:
      1.   An increase in crime rates, particularly those that are sex-related;
      2.   A negative impact on the real estate market where adult
entertainment is offered; and
      3.   Urban blight as a result of the decrease in property values.
In particular, the Mayor and City Council have taken notice of the blighted,
dangerous and crime-producing conditions which have existed on nearby Mannheim
Road, on which a number of adult-oriented businesses have located.
In attempting to curb these secondary effects, the regulations serve the City's
substantial interest in the health, safety and welfare of the people of the
City; and
   I.   The detailed findings summarized in the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925 (1986),
the Illinois Supreme Court opinion in County of Cook v. Renaissance Arcade and
Bookstore, 122 III.2d 123 (1988), and the United States District Court, Eastern
Division of Michigan opinion in S&G News, Inc. v. City of Southgate, 638
F.Supp. 1060 (E.D. Mich. 1986) aff'd 819 F.2d 1142 (6th Cir. 1987), were before
the Board of Appeals- Plan Commission when it recommended the adoption of these
regulations. (Ord. O-11-98, 2-9-1998)
3-4D-2: PURPOSE OF REGULATIONS:
These regulations are aimed at the secondary effects of adult uses, and not at
the content of the activities performed at such uses. In addition, these
regulations are based on the City's substantial interest in preventing crime,
protecting retail trade, maintaining property values, and generally to protect
and preserve the quality of the City's neighborhoods, commercial districts, and
the quality of urban life. Furthermore, it is not the purpose of these
regulations to deny anyone a reasonable opportunity to open and operate adult
uses within the City. The predominate purpose of these regulations is the
amelioration of socially adverse secondary effects of adult uses. Finally, the
Illinois Supreme Court has judicially confirmed that the purpose of these
regulations as hereinafter provided serves a valid governmental interest. (Ord.
O-11-98, 2-9-1998)

(30) days after commencing such business or thirty (30) days after the
effective date of the ordinance imposing the push tax, whichever occurs later.
The application shall be submitted to the city on forms provided by the city
and shall contain such information as reasonably required by the city to
impose, collect, and audit all amounts related to the push tax. (O-16-2021, 10-
31-2021)
3-4H-12: COLLECTION, PAYMENT, AND ACCOUNTING:
   A.   It shall be the joint and several duty of every terminal operator of a
video gaming terminal to secure from each person participating in the play of a
video gaming terminal the push tax imposed by this chapter. For purposes of
this chapter, it shall be presumed that the amount of the push tax imposed on
each person, unless the taxpayer or tax collector proves otherwise with books,
records, or other documentary evidence, has been collected from the person by
the terminal operator. Push tax payments accompanied by tax returns prescribed
by the city shall be remitted to the city on or before the 20th day of the
month following the month in which payment of the push tax is made.
   B.   Every terminal operator of a video gaming terminal who is required to
collect the push tax by this chapter shall be considered a tax collector for
the city. All push tax amounts collected shall be held by the terminal operator
as trustee for and on behalf of the city. The failure of the terminal operator
to collect the tax shall not excuse or release the person from the obligation
to pay the tax. The ultimate incidence of the push tax shall remain on the
person and shall never be shifted to the terminal operator.
   C.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in order to permit
sound fiscal planning and budgeting by the city, no person shall be entitled to
a refund of, or credit for, the push tax imposed by this chapter unless the
person files a claim for a refund or credit within one (1) year after the date
on which the push tax was remitted to the city.
   D.   The terminal operator of any video gaming terminal shall be subject to
the audit, inspection, and record keeping provisions of this code. It shall be
unlawful for any terminal operator and/or person to prevent, hinder, or
interfere with the city's officials, employees, and/or agents designated to
discharge their respective duties in the performance of their duties and the
enforcement of this chapter. (O-16-2021, 10-31-2021)
3-4H-13: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
   A.   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a terminal operator to fail
to file a tax return described in Section
3-4H-12 within the time prescribed in this chapter.
   B.   A terminal operator who falsely reports or fails to report the amount
of push tax due required by this chapter shall be in violation of chapter and
is subject to suspension and/or revocation of their terminal operator license.
All payments not remitted when due shall be paid together with a penalty
assessment on the unpaid balance at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%)
per month.
   C.   Suspension Or Revocation of License: The Mayor or his or her designee
shall have the power to suspend for not more than thirty (30) days or revoke
any video gaming license issued under the provisions of this chapter, or if he/
she determines that a terminal operator shall have violated any of the
provisions of this chapter, any of the statutes of the State or any other valid
ordinance or resolution enacted by the city. However, no such license shall be
revoked or suspended except after the holding of a hearing by the Mayor or his
or her designee. Ten (10) days' notice of the hearing shall be given to the
terminal operator. Alternatively, the terminal operator shall have the
opportunity to engage in a prehearing conference and agree to negotiated
penalties rather than proceed to a hearing. (O-16-2021, 10-31-2021)
3-4H-99: PENALTY:
Whoever violates any provision of this article shall be punished by a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each day any violation
continues shall constitute a separate offense. This monetary penalty shall be
in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to the City.

      2.   In determining whether public convenience and necessity require the
licensing of such taxicabs for which application may be made, the City Council
shall take into consideration:
         a.   Whether the demands of public convenience and necessity require
such proposed or such additional taxicab service within the City;
         b.   The financial responsibility of the applicant;
         c.   The number, kind and type of equipment;
         d.   The schedule of maximum rates proposed to be charged;
         e.   The color scheme to be used by the applicant;

spaces on the streets of the City which may result;
         g.   Whether the safe use of the streets by the public, both vehicular
and pedestrian, will be preserved by the granting of such additional license;
and
         h.   Such other relevant facts as the City Council may deem advisable
or necessary.
      3.   If the City Council finds from the investigation and hearing that
the public convenience and necessity justify the operation of the taxicab for
which license is desired, it shall notify the applicant of its finding. Within
sixty (60) days thereafter, the applicant shall furnish to the City Council any
and all additional information which may be required, and if the City Council
then finds that the applicant is the owner and bona fide operator of the
vehicle for which the license is desired and that such vehicle complies with
all of the provisions of this Code and other ordinances of the City, the
license shall thereupon be issued to the applicant upon the payment of the
proper license fee. 2
If the City Council finds from such investigation and hearing that the public
convenience and necessity do not justify the operation of the vehicle for which
the license is desired, it shall forthwith notify the applicant of such
finding.
   D.   Bond or Insurance Required: No owner shall be licensed to operate a
taxicab until he has complied with the State law pertaining to a surety bond or

insurance with the City Clerk.

subsection B of this Section shall be issued quarterly decals which shall
contain a number assigned to the taxicab, together with the date of the most
recent inspection. Such decal shall contain a space upon which an entry shall
be made of the date of inspection of the taxicab by the Director of Health and
Inspectional Services or an inspector appointed by him. Certification decals
shall be of a distinctly different color each quarter and shall be affixed to
the lower right-hand corner of the windshield of each taxicab.
   F.   Register of Licenses: The City Clerk shall keep a register of the name
and address of each person owning or operating a taxicab licensed under this
Chapter, together with the decal number and the description, make and necessary
dimensions of such taxicab, with the date and complete record of inspections
made of it. Such records shall be open to the inspection of the public at all
reasonable times, and shall be public records, extracts of which may be
certified for use as evidence by the City Clerk.
   G.   Revocation or Suspension of License: Any taxicab license shall be
subject to suspension or revocation upon conviction of the holder thereof for
any violation of this Chapter. The City Council may, at its discretion, suspend
or revoke a license granted upon any provision of this Chapter pending or in
advance of the criminal prosecution of the licensee, after notice and hearing.

a taxicab, it shall be the duty of the Director of Health and Inspectional
Services to examine and inspect the taximeter attached thereto and report its
condition to the City Clerk. At least once, annually, said Director of Health
and Inspectional Services shall in like manner examine, inspect and seal all
taximeters used in vehicles licensed in the City; provided, however, that in
the event complaint is made to the Director of Health and Inspectional Services
that any taximeter registers improperly or inaccurately, then it shall be the

such taximeter does not comply with the requirements of subsection C of this
Section then, and in that event, it shall be unlawful for the owner or person
in charge of such taxicab to permit its use until such taxicab is equipped with
a taximeter approved by the Director.
      3.   Tests:
         a.   Every taximeter shall be tested by running the taxicab to which

test to prove the accuracy of the register thereof. Either of the foregoing
tests may be made in the discretion of the Director of Health and Inspectional
Services.
         b.   In order to determine whether such taximeter correctly registers
"waiting time", it shall be the duty of the Director of Health and Inspectional

fare computed on the dial thereof with the standard time.
         c.   It shall be the duty of any person owning, controlling or
operating a taxicab to deliver either the taxicab, together with the taximeter,
or the taximeter detached therefrom, to the Director of Health and Inspectional
Services or any of his deputies for the purpose of making the aforesaid test

the date of the inspection thereof in the books of his office.
      5.   Inspection Fees: The fee to be charged for the annual inspection of
each taximeter is hereby fixed at the sum of five dollars ($5.00). No charge

dollars ($5.00) shall be charged.

by two inches (3" x 2") in size, either painted red or bearing thereon in
letters at least one inch (1") in height, the word "Vacant" or the words "For
Hire". The flag post of such flag shall be kept up or towards a vertical
position when the taxicab is for hire, and when such taxicab is engaged in the
service of a passenger or passengers, such flag post shall be kept down or in a
horizontal position.
      3.   Each taxicab shall, during the period between sunset and sunrise, be
equipped with a light which shall be so reflected upon the dial of the
taximeter as to enable the passenger engaging and using such taxicab to read
the figures indicated thereon.
      4.   Every taximeter placed on a taxicab shall be so arranged that the
dial thereof is in plain view of the passenger while riding in such taxicab or
upon alighting from the same.
   D.   Transferring Taximeters: No person shall detach any certified or
inspected taximeter from any taxicab and attach the same to any other taxicab,
the front wheels of which are of different diameter from those with reference
to which the taximeter was originally tested unless a new inspection or
certification is had on such taximeter.
   E.   False Signals: No driver of a taxicab equipped with a taximeter, while
carrying a passenger or under employment, shall display the signal affixed to
such taximeter or other similar device in such a position as to denote that he
is employed at a rate of fare different from that to which he is entitled under
the provisions of this Chapter. (Ord. 0-61-89, 12-18-89)

curbside in front of the dwelling unit. All such containers, when properly
marked or tagged with official yard material identification, shall be collected
and removed according to the pickup schedule established by the Department of
Public Works. Landscape waste containers may only be used for landscape waste
as defined herein. The City or its authorized representative may reject any
landscape waste container that is not limited to landscape waste, that is not
marked or tagged with an official yard material identification tag or sticker
or any nonbiodegradable container but shall tag the container with a note
explaining why the City or its authorized representative refused collection of
the container. Landscape waste containers may not be placed in front of the
dwelling unit prior to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on the day prior to the
scheduled pickup date.
      2.   Brush and branches three inches (3") or less in diameter, securely
tied in bundles not exceeding three feet (3') in length and two feet (2') in

   A.   No landscape waste shall be deposited in any street, gutter or upon any
curb.
   B.   It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, attempt to remove,
deface or alter any official yard material identification tag or sticker that
has been placed upon a bag or other container which is intended by the property
owner or occupant to be removed by the City or its authorized agent pursuant to
this Article, which tag or sticker indicates that such bag or container
contains landscape waste, unless authorized by the property owner or occupant.
(Ord. 0-30-90, 6-4-90)

but merely to call the police about any and all suspicious happenings in the
community. (Ord. O-15-87, 11-10-1987)
5-4-3: ORGANIZATION:
   A.   Supervision: The Northlake chief of police will oversee the functioning
of the neighborhood watch program. The chief of police will appoint a Northlake
police officer to perform the functions of the crime prevention officer. (Ord.

      2.   These positions will be filled by mayoral appointment, for one year
terms, subject to city council approval. Individuals may serve more than one
term who, in turn, will appoint, by wards, block captains, recruited to be the
program representatives on each block. Blocks will be considered operative and
entitled to street signs upon fifty percent (50%) registration of a block.

on the day to day running of the program.
         b.   Review crime reports on a daily basis and notify ward

overall responsibility for operation of the neighborhood watch program in his/
her ward. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

general duties will help to promote the complete neighborhood watch program in
Northlake:

         b.   Initiate an ongoing public relations program with the local media
to increase the public awareness concerning neighborhood watch, crime

93, 10-4-1993; Ord. O-06-2014, 3-3-2014)
5-4-4: PROGRAMS OFFERED:
The key to any neighborhood watch program is what the program has to offer the
residents. In the case of Northlake, the key element is education. The program
needs to offer education concerning the neighborhood watch concept but can also
go further into related subjects. The following are programs the original
writers of Northlake's program believed could and should be offered whenever
needed or requested. This is by no means a limit on what information we can
offer but just a brief beginning:
   A.   Children:
      1.   Fingerprinting, which is often offered by other sources, but
neighborhood watch should be ready to participate.
      2.   Support of "helping hand" program offered through area schools by
alerting neighborhood watch participants of school walking routes and times.
      3.   A program (like Officer Friendly) for parents and children which
allows for parental input and follow up after programs rather than just
literature sent home with the child.
      4.   "Stranger danger" alerts could be handled on a trickle down theory
from school principals/police department to the ward coordinators for
transmission to the block captains and residents. This would allow all
neighbors near the school to be on an extra lookout for the offending stranger
and give children and parents a safer feeling.
      5.   Promotion of the I-Search program through presentation of the
various I-Search materials available.
   B.   Senior Citizens:
      1.   Vial of life/medicalert bracelets.
      2.   Senior citizen check - disabled or seniors alone, notify block
captain or ward coordinator. In turn, neighbors are recruited to check
periodically to see that the senior is ok and offer whatever assistance
possible.
      3.   Transportation assistance.
      4.   Whistle stop.
      5.   Youth escort service.
   C.   General Population:
      1.   Rape prevention and self protection.
      2.   Home security checks.
      3.   Gang prevention and awareness.
      4.   Operation identification.
As stated earlier, these are only suggestions. The only limitation is
imagination. (Ord. O-15-87, 11-10-1987; amd. Ord. O-30-93, 10-4-1993; Ord. O-
06-2014, 3-3-2014)
5-4-5: PUBLICITY:
It has been proven that publicity is essential to any neighborhood watch
program. The more visibility, the better. To reach this goal, the city
coordinator and ward coordinators should strive to develop a working
relationship with the local media. In the past, the local media has been very
cooperative in relation to neighborhood watch.
All avenues of publicity should be utilized including: newspapers, cable
television, radio, "What's New In Northlake", newsletters, announcements in
local community group meetings and in local churches and the use of Northlake
Bank sign for community messages. (Ord. O-15-87, 11-10-1987)
5-4-6: PROGRAM REVIEW:
The neighborhood watch program will undergo a constant process of effectiveness
review. Whenever there is need for changes, the CPO and the coordinators will
discuss the changes and make proposals to the chief of police who will then
present the changes to the city council if necessary. The program is always
open to comments and suggestions from any citizen of Northlake as this program
is for the people of Northlake. (Ord. O-15-87, 11-10-1987; amd. Ord. O-30-93,
10-4-1993; Ord. O-06-2014, 3-3-2014)

not apply at any such hearing. Such hearings shall be recorded, and the person
conducting the hearing on behalf of the administrator shall be empowered to
administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of
witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at
such a hearing may be represented by counsel at their own expense.
   G.   A final determination of automated traffic law violation liability
shall occur following failure to pay the fine or penalty after a hearing

mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited
vehicle as recorded with the secretary or, if any notice to that address is
returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United
States post office approved database or, under section 11-1306 of the code, to
the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the
cited vehicle at the time of the lease or, if any notice to that address is
returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United
States post office database. Service of the determination notice shall be
deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail.
   I.   A person owing an unpaid fine or penalty for automated traffic law
violation penalty may file a petition to set aside a final determination of
such liability within ten (10) days after service by the city of a
determination notice. Such a petition shall be filed by sending the same,
together with any documentation in support thereof, to the administrator by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery to the
administrator. The grounds for such a petition shall be limited to: 1) the
person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the
violation notice was issued, 2) the person having already paid the fine, or
penalty for the violation in question, and 3) excusable failure to appear at or
request a new date for a hearing. A hearing on such a petition shall be held
within thirty (30) days after the filing of same. In the event that such a
petition is granted upon a showing of just cause, and the subject determination
of automated traffic law violation liability is thereby set aside, the
registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that
violation.
   J.   A suspension notice, the contents of which shall comply with the
requirements of sections 6-306.5 and 11-208.3 of the code, as amended, shall be
sent to the person liable for any fine or penalty that remains due and owing on
five (5) or more unpaid automated traffic law violations. The suspension notice
shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the
address recorded with the secretary or, if any notice to that address is
returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United
States post office approved database. Service of a suspension notice shall be
deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail.
   K.   If the administrator provides a suspension notice to a vehicle owner
and subsequently makes a certified report to the secretary, the subject vehicle
owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report in writing. To do so,
the vehicle owner must submit to the administrator a written statement under
oath, together with any supporting documentation, establishing one of the
following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the certified report: 1) that
the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle or vehicles
receiving five (5) or more automated traffic law violations on the date or
dates such violation notices were issued, or 2) that the person already paid
the fines or penalties for the five (5) or more automated traffic law
violations indicated on the certified report. Such statement and supporting
documentation must be sent to the administrator by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or hand delivered to the administrator within five (5) days
after the person receives notice from the secretary that the person's driver's
license will be suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the
secretary is presented with a notice from the city certifying that the fines or
penalties due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's
name on the certified report was in error.
   L.   Nonresidents of the city who receive violation notices may contest the
merits of the alleged automated traffic law violation without attending a
hearing by sending a signed statement, under oath, together with any supporting
documentation, to the administrator via certified mail, return receipt
requested, within ten (10) days after service of the violation notice. Such a
statement shall set forth the reasons why a finding of liability should not be
entered. The administrator shall rule on such a statement within ten (10) days
after receipt of same, and shall inform the nonresident of his decision within
ten (10) days thereafter. (Ord. O-19-2007, 8-6-2007)

law violation received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer at the
time of the violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a penalty
of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation. In the event that such penalty
is not paid within twenty one (21) days after service of a violation notice, a
person will have ten (10) days to respond. If no response is received within
ten (10) days, the penalty shall increase to two hundred dollars ($200.00).

impounded until the owner pays the administrative fee to the city, plus fees to
the tower for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If the owner of record
fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order
in favor of the city. If the hearing officer finds no such violation occurred,
the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or
cash payment without fees. (Ord. O-08-2006, 3-6-2006; amd. Ord. O-11-2011, 4-
18-2011)
   I.   Administrative Fee: If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to
this section, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing the city. If a
cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section the bond shall be applied to
the fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when an administrative fee is imposed,
the city may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment
against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the fee is paid to the
city and any applicable towing fees are paid to the tower, in which case
possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled
to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to
satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative
fee and other applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after an
administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by
failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and other
applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the expiration of
time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may
be sought, or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking administrative
review has been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is applicable, the
vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois
vehicle code. (Ord. O-08-2006, 3-6-2006)

      1.   These provisions shall provide a system of administrative
adjudication as required by section 11-208.3 of the Illinois vehicle code to

more city standing and/or parking violations.
      2.   These provisions shall not preclude the city from adopting
procedures pursuant to 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/6-306.5 providing for
the authority to file a certified report to the Illinois secretary of state
upon a person's failure to satisfy any fine or penalty imposed by a final
judgment from a court of law for ten (10) or more standing and/or parking
violations.
In addition, notwithstanding any provision of this section, the city may
continue to prosecute in a court of law any person receiving less than ten (10)
standing and/or parking violations. (Ord. O-15A-90, 3-19-1990)
      3.   An individual, appointed by the mayor, shall serve as parking
administrator under the direction of the chief of police and shall be
authorized to adopt, distribute and process parking violation notices required,
collect money paid as fines and penalties for violation of parking ordinances
and shall operate the administrative adjudication system. The parking
administrator also may make a certified report to the secretary of state.
      4.   The city prosecutor or some other individual designated by the
mayor, shall serve as hearing officer and shall perform such duties as defined
within this Section. (Ord. 0-15A-90, 3-19-90; 1992 Code)
   B.   Authority to Issue:

standing citations and who detects a violation of any section of this Code
restricting or prohibiting parking or standing of motor vehicles shall issue a
hang-on parking violation notice by either affixing it to an unlawfully parked
vehicle or handing it to the operator of such vehicle if he or she is present.
      2.   Police officers, auxiliary police officers, City inspectors and Code
enforcement officers shall be authorized, in the course of their specific
duties, to issue hang-on parking violation notices in accordance with the
provisions set forth herein.
   C.   Action by Recipient of Citation: A person receiving a citation for a
parking violation may make an appearance in one of the following manners:
      1.   Payment of the fine indicated on the citation. Such payment shall be
made by the deadline stated on the citation and shall operate as the final
disposition of the violation; or
      2.   Requesting a hearing on the merits of the parking violation in the
time and manner specified on the hang-on notice and attendance at the hearing
at the time, date and place specified by the Parking Administrator. The hearing
shall be conducted in accordance with procedures set forth herein.
   D.   Failure to Appear; Service of Additional Notices:
      1.   Failure to make an appearance shall result in additional notices of
violation, as indicated in this subsection, being sent by first class mail to
the registered owner of the cited vehicle at his or her address as recorded
with the Secretary of State or to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last
address known to the lessor of said vehicle at the time of the lease. Service
of additional notices shall be complete as of the date of deposit in the United
State mail.
      2.   A second notice of violation shall be sent to the responsible party,
as defined in subsection D1 above upon the failure of the recipient of a hang-
on parking violation to make an appearance as prescribed in subsection C of
this Section. The recipient may appear by either paying the indicated fine and
assessed penalty for late charges or by requesting a hearing on the merits of
the citation in the time and manner specified on the second notice and
attending such hearing at the time, date and place specified by the Parking
Administrator. Failure to appear as herein prescribed shall result in a final
determination of parking violation liability for the cited violation.
      3.   A notice of final determination of parking violation liability shall
be sent to the responsible party, as defined in subsection D1 above, upon the
failure to appear pursuant to the second notice of violation and after a final
determination of parking violation liability has been rendered in accordance
with subsection D2 hereof. The recipient may appear by paying the fine and
penalty within the time specified on the notice and shall be advised that
failure to do so pay may result in the City's filing of a petition in the
Circuit Court to have the unpaid fine or penalty rendered a judgment as
provided by section 11-208.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, and that proceedings
to suspend his driver's license will be initiated pursuant to chapter 951/2,
section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code for failure to pay fines or
penalties for ten (10) or more parking violations.
      4.   A notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent to
the person for whom a final determination of liability was rendered, in
accordance with this subsection, on each of ten (10) or more unpaid parking
violations. Failure to pay the fines and/or penalties owing within forty five
(45) days of the notice's date shall result in notification to the Secretary of
State of said person's eligibility for initiation of driver's license
suspension proceedings.
   E.   Final Determination of Parking Liability; Petition to Set Aside:
      1.   A final determination of parking ticket violation liability shall
occur following failure to pay the fine or penalty after a hearing officer's
determination of parking violation liability and the Parking Administrator's
denial of a petition to set aside the determination or expiration of the period
for filing such petition without a filing having been made.
      2.   A determination of parking ticket violation liability may be set
aside by filing a petition with the Parking Administrator within ten (10)
working days after the hearing officer's determination. Petitions shall specify
the grounds on which a challenge may be based, including the following:
         a.   The person owing the unpaid fine and/or penalty was neither the
owner nor lessee of the cited vehicle(s) on the date or dates the parking
violation notice was issued;
         b.   The fine and/or penalty were paid for the parking violation in
question;
         c.   Excusable failure to request a hearing, appear at the hearing or
request a new date for hearing.
      3.   The Parking Administrator shall render a decision within fourteen
(14) days of the petition's receipt and shall immediately notify the hearing
officer and petitioner of such decision. If the petitioner has shown just
cause, the Parking Administrator shall set aside the parking ticket violation
liability determination.
      4.   If the petition is granted, and the determination of parking
violation liability set aside, the registered owner or lessee shall be provided
a hearing on the merits of the violation and shall be given notice of the time
and manner in which it will take place.
   F.   Administrative Adjudication Of Parking Violations: The hang on parking
violation citation and the second notice of liability shall provide the alleged
violator with the time and manner in which a hearing contesting the merits of
the alleged violation shall be held. Neither formal nor technical rules of
evidence shall apply. Such hearing shall be recorded, and the person conducting
the hearing, on behalf of the parking administrator, shall be empowered to
administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of
witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at
such hearing may be represented by counsel at their own expense.
   G.   Certified Report; Contesting Certified Report:

the exhaustion of administrative procedures set forth herein for ten (10) or
more parking violations, the parking administrator shall make a certified
report to the secretary of state stating that the owner of a registered vehicle
has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of ten (10) or
more violations of the city's vehicular parking regulations and thereby cause
the suspension of that person's driver's license. A copy of the certified
report shall be sent to the registered owner.
      2.   The parking administrator shall take no further action unless and
until the fines and penalties due and owing are paid or upon determination that
the inclusion of the person's name on the certified report was in error. At
such time, the parking administrator shall submit to the secretary of state a
notification which shall result in the halting of a driver's license suspension
proceedings. The person named therein shall receive a certified copy of such
notification upon request and at no charge.
      3.   Persons may challenge the accuracy of the certified report by
completing a form provided by the office of the parking administrator within
ten (10) days after the date of the certified report and which specifies
grounds on which such challenge is based. Grounds for challenge shall be

more violations indicated on the certified report.
      4.   The parking administrator shall render a determination within ten
(10) business days of receipt of the objection form and shall notify the
objector thereof.
   H.   Procedure For Nonresidents:
      1.   Persons who are not residents of the city may contest the merits of
the alleged violation without attending a hearing as provided herein by

vehicles being towed. The tow truck license plate must cover the operating
empty weight of the tow truck only. The weight of each vehicle being towed
shall be covered by a valid license plate issued to the owner or operator of
the vehicle being towed and displayed on that vehicle. If no valid plate issued
to the owner or operator of that vehicle is displayed on that vehicle, or the
plate displayed on that vehicle does not cover the weight of the vehicle, the
weight of the vehicle shall be covered by the third tow truck plate issued to
the owner or operator of the tow truck and temporarily affixed to the vehicle
being towed.
In addition, the following conditions must be met:
      1.   The towing vehicle must be:
         a.   Specifically designed as a tow truck having a gross vehicle
weight rating of at least eighteen thousand (18,000) pounds and equipped with
air brakes, provided that air brakes shall be required only if the towing
vehicle is towing a vehicle, semitrailer, or tractor-trailer combination that
is equipped with airbrakes;
         b.   Equipped with flashing, rotating or oscillating amber lights,
visible for a least five hundred feet (500') in all directions; and
         c.   Capable of utilizing the lighting and braking systems of the
disabled vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      2.   The towing of such vehicles on the highways and streets of the City
shall not exceed fifteen (15) miles from the initial point of wreck or
disablement. Any additional movement of such vehicles shall only occur upon
issuance of authorization for the movement pursuant to the applicable
provisions of this Chapter.
Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit a tow truck under instruction of a
police officer from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that may be in
violation of weight limitations of this Chapter, from the roadway to the berm
or shoulder of the highway or street.
For the purpose of subsection E2 of this Section, gross vehicle weight rating,
or GVWR, shall mean the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded
weight of the tow truck.
   D.   No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with pneumatic tires
shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon the highways or streets of the
City in violation of the provision of any permit issued under the provisions of
Sections
6-8-20 through
6-8-32 of this Chapter.
   E.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Chapter, except for those
special provisions relating to emergency operations of public utilities and tow
trucks while actually engaged in the towing of a disabled vehicle, those
vehicles exempted by subsection C of this Section, and those vehicles for which
the City issues an overweight permit, the weight limitations contained in this
subsection shall apply to the National System of Interstate and Defense
Highways and other highways in the system of State highways that have been
designated by the Illinois Department of Transportation and all streets and
highways in the City. No vehicle shall be operated on said streets and highways
with a weight in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) pounds carried on any one
axle or with a tandem axle weight in excess of thirty four thousand (34,000)
pounds, or a gross weight in excess of eighty thousand (80,000) pounds for
vehicle combinations of five (5) axles or more, or a gross weight on a group of
two (2) or more consecutive axles in excess of that weight produced by the
application of the following formula:
W = 500 times the sum of (LN divided by N-1) + 12N + 36
Where "W" equals overall gross weight on any group of two (2) or more
consecutive axles to the nearest five hundred (500) pounds; "L" equals the
distance measured to the nearest foot between extremes of any group of two (2)
or more consecutive axles; and "N" equals the number of axles in the group
under consideration, except that two (2) consecutive sets of tandem axles may
carry a gross load of thirty four thousand (34,000) pounds each, provided the
overall distance between the first and last axles of the consecutive sets of
tandem axles is thirty six feet (36') or more. Provided also that a three (3)
axle vehicle registered as a special hauling vehicle manufactured prior to or
in the model year of 2004, and first registered in Illinois prior to January 1,
2005, with a distance greater than seventy two inches (72") but not more than
ninety six inches (96") between the two (2) rear axles may transmit to the road
surface a maximum weight of eighteen thousand (18,000) pounds on each of the
two (2) rear axles with a gross weight not to exceed thirty six thousand
(36,000) pounds. Any vehicle registered as a special hauling vehicle
manufactured in the model year of 2004 or thereafter or first registered in
Illinois after December 31, 2004, may transmit to the road surface a maximum of
thirty four thousand (34,000) pounds through the two (2) rear axles and neither
of the rear axles shall exceed twenty thousand (20,000) pounds. For purposes of
this subsection, "tandem axles" shall be defined as any two (2) or more single
axles whose centers are more than forty inches (40") and not more than ninety
six inches (96") apart, measured to the nearest inch between extreme axles in
the series.
The above formula when expressed in tabular form results in allowable loads as
follows:
Distance Measured To The
Nearest Foot Between The Maximum Loads In Pounds Carried On Any Group Of 2 Or
Extremes Of Any Group Of More Consecutive Axles
2 Or
More Consecutive Axles   2 Axles 3 Axles 4 Axles 5 Axles 6 Axles

   F.   In applying the above formula to a vehicle having more than four (4)
axles which is not a combination, only four (4) axles shall be considered in
determining the maximum gross weight, and for a combination of vehicle having
more than six (6) axles, only six (6) axles shall be considered in determining
the maximum gross weight.
Notwithstanding the above table, two (2) consecutive sets of tandem axles may
carry a gross weight of thirty four thousand (34,000) pounds each if the
overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of
tandem axles is thirty six feet (36') or more.
Combinations of vehicles, registered as special hauling vehicles that include a
semitrailer manufactured prior to or in the model year of 2004, and first
registered in Illinois prior to January 1, 2005, having five (5) axles with a
distance of forty two feet (42') or less between extreme axles shall be limited
to the weights prescribed in subsections A and B of this Section and not
subject to the bridge formula on the National System of Interstate and Defense
Highways and other highways in the system of State highways designated by the
Department. For all those combinations of vehicles, that include a semitrailer
manufactured after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1986, the
overall distance between the first and last axles of the two (2) sets of
tandems must be eighteen feet six inches (18'6") or more. All combinations of
vehicles registered as special hauling vehicles that include a semitrailer
manufactured prior to or in the model year of 2004 or thereafter or first
registered in Illinois after December 31, 2004, or that has had its cargo
container replaced in its entirety after December 31, 2004, are limited to the
gross weight allowed by the above formula.
Vehicles operating under this subsection shall have access for a distance of
one highway mile to or from a Class I highway on any street or highway, unless
there is a sign prohibiting the access, or five (5) highway miles to or from
either a Class I, II, or III highway on a street or highway included in the
system of State highways and upon any street or highway designated by local
authorities or road district commissioners to points of loading and unloading
and to facilities for food, fuel, repairs and rest.
   G.   No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over a
bridge or other elevated structure constituting part of a highway or street
with a gross weight which is greater than the maximum weight permitted by the
Illinois Department of Transportation or the City, when such structure is
signposted as provided in this Section.
   H.   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of subsection F
of this Section, proof of the determination of the maximum allowable weight by
the Illinois Department of Transportation or the City and the existence of the
signs, constitutes conclusive evidence of the maximum weight which can be
maintained with safety to such bridge or structure. (Ord. O-01-98, 1-5-1998)
6-8-12: OFFICERS TO WEIGH VEHICLES AND REQUIRE REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOADS:
   A.   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and load is unlawful shall require the driver to stop and submit to a
weighing of the same either by means of a portable or stationary scales. If
such scales are not available at the place where such vehicle is stopped, the
police officer shall require that such vehicle be driven to the nearest
available scale that has been tested and approved by the Illinois Department of
Agriculture. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Weights and Measures Act or
the United States Department of Commerce NIST handbook 44, multi or single
draft weighing is an acceptable method of weighing by law enforcement for
determining a violation of this Chapter. Law enforcement is exempt from the
requirements of commercial weighing established in NIST handbook 44.
   B.   Whenever a police officer, upon weighing a vehicle and the load,
determines that the weight is unlawful, such officer shall require the driver
to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until such portion
of the load is removed as may be necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle
to the limit permitted under this Chapter, or to the limit permitted under the
terms of a permit, issued pursuant to this Chapter and shall forthwith arrest
the driver or owner. All material so unloaded shall be cared for by the owner
or operator of the vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator; however,
whenever a three (3) or four (4) axle vehicle with a tandem axle dimension
greater than seventy two inches (72"), but less than ninety six inches (96")
and registered as a special hauling vehicle is transporting asphalt, or
concrete in the plastic state that exceeds axle weight or gross weight limits
by less than four thousand (4,000) pounds, the owner or operator of the vehicle
shall accept the arrest ticket or tickets for the alleged violations under this
Section and proceed without shifting or reducing the load being transported or
may shift or reduce the load under the provisions of subsection D or E of this
Section, when applicable. Any fine imposed following an overweight violation by
a vehicle registered as a special hauling vehicle transporting asphalt or
concrete in the plastic state shall be paid as provided in this Chapter.
   C.   Whenever any axle load of a vehicle exceeds the axle or tandem axle
weight limits permitted by subsection
6-8-11A or
 6-8-11E of this Chapter by two thousand (2,000) pounds or less, the owner or
operator of the vehicle must shift or remove the excess so as to comply with
subsection
 6-8-11A or
6-8-11E of this Chapter. No overweight arrest ticket shall be issued to the
owner or operator of the vehicle by any officer if the gross weight is shifted
or removed as required by this subsection.
   D.   Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a registered gross weight
of seventy three thousand two hundred eighty (73,280) pounds or less exceeds
the weight limits of subsection
 6-8-11B or
6-8-11E of this Chapter by two thousand (2,000) pounds or less, the owner or
operator of the vehicle must remove the excess. Whenever the gross weight of a
vehicle with a registered gross weight of seventy three thousand two hundred
eighty one (73,281) pounds or more exceeds the weight limits of subsection
6-8-11B or
6-8-11E of this Chapter by one thousand (1,000) pounds or less, the owner or
operator of the vehicle must remove the excess. In either case no arrest ticket
for any overweight violation of this Chapter shall be issued to the owner or
operator of the vehicle by any officer if the excess weight is removed as
required by this subsection.
   E.   Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle exceeds the registration weight
limits established under 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-401, by two
thousand one (2,001) pounds or more, the driver or owner, in addition to any
other violation or penalty, shall be fined in accordance to the schedule
enumerated in Section
6-8-13 of this Chapter.
   F.   Whenever any axle load of a vehicle exceeds axle weight limits
allowable by the provisions of a permit, an arrest ticket shall be issued, but
the owner or operator of such vehicle may shift the load so as to comply with
the provisions of the permit. Where such shifting of a load to comply with the
permit is accomplished, the owner or operator of the vehicle may then proceed.
   G.   Any driver of a vehicle who refused to stop and submit his vehicle and
load to weighing after being directed to do so by an officer or removes or
causes the removal of the load or part of it prior to weighing is guilty of a
business offense and shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). (Ord. O-01-98, 1-5-
1998)
6-8-13: VIOLATIONS, PENALTIES:

person, within a period of one year after the date of the first offense, not
less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than two thousand dollars
($2,000.00). (Ord. O-01-98, 1-5-1998)
6-8-14: VIOLATIONS, SENTENCE OF PERMIT MOVES:
Whenever any vehicle is operated in violation of the provisions of a permit
issued under the provisions of Sections
6-8-20 through
6-8-32 of this Chapter by operating under a fraudulent permit or under a permit
not specifically covering the move, the owner or driver of such vehicle shall
be deemed guilty of a business offense and either the owner or the driver of
such vehicle may be prosecuted for such violation. When any person is convicted
of such violation, the permit shall be null and void and such person, shall be
fined in an amount not less than ten cents ($0.10) per pound for each pound the
gross weight of the vehicle exceeds the gross weight of such vehicles allowable
under Section
6-8-11 of this Chapter. (Ord. O-01-98, 1-5-1998)
6-8-15: VIOLATIONS, SENTENCE OF PERMIT MOVES EXCEEDING AXLE WEIGHTS:
Whenever any vehicle is operated in violation of the provisions of a permit
issued under the provisions of Sections
6-8-20 through

police officer, or authorized agent of the City to remove the permit from the
possession of the permittee. However, upon arrest for a violation of permit,
the permittee, or his agent, must produce the permit at any court hearing
concerning the alleged violation of permit.

account of any work done thereunder, and further conditioned that the grantee
shall restore at his own cost, to a condition satisfactory to the City, any
pavement, subway, tunnel, sewer, pipe, conduit, or other public utility that

days when tested by standard methods.
   F.   Subgrade:
      1.   During excavation, all unsuitable material such as black dirt,
broken concrete, spoil or any other material deemed unsatisfactory by the
Director of Health and Inspectional Services shall be removed from the sidewalk
area and a satisfactory subgrade established. Fill under sidewalks shall
consist of tamped or rolled sand, gravel or crushed stone, satisfactory to the
Director of Health and Inspectional Services.
      2.   The subgrade shall be tamped or rolled until thoroughly compacted,
shall be constructed true to line, grade and cross-section for the bottom of
the sidewalk or sidewalk apron and shall be prepared sufficiently wide to
accommodate the forms.
   G.   Embankments: Embankments prepared for walk construction shall be not
less than six inches (6") wider on each side than the width of the walk to be
installed.
   H.   Forms:
      1.   Side forms shall be lumber with a nominal thickness of two inches
(2") or of steel of equal rigidity. They shall be held securely in place by
stakes or braces, with the top edges true to line and grade. The forms for
street sidewalks shall be so set that the slab will have a fall of one inch
(1") vertical to four feet (4') horizontal from the edge nearest the property
line toward the edge farthest from the property line.
      2.   Forms for the sidewalk aprons shall be so set that the slab will
have a uniform fall between the sidewalk proper and the curb grade. Forms shall
be of a depth equivalent to or greater than the thickness of the walk;
   I.   Laying Concrete: The subgrade or subbase shall be adequately moistened
just before the concrete is placed. The concrete shall be placed in successive
bate for the entire width of the slab, tamped until all voids are removed and
free mortar appears on the surface thoroughly spaded along the edges, struck
off to the true grade and finished to a true and even surface with suitable
trowels and floats. The surface shall be divided by grooves constructed at
right angles to the center line of the sidewalk. These grooves shall extend to
one-fourth (1/4) the depth of the sidewalk, shall be not less than one-eighth
inch (1/8") or more than one-fourth inch (1/4") in width and shall have the
edge rounded one-fourth inch (1/4"). No slab shall be longer than six feet (6')
or less than four feet (4') unless otherwise approved by the Director of Health
and Inspectional Services. The side edges of the walk shall also be edged with
an edging tool, having a one-fourth inch (1/4") radius. The finished sidewalk
shall be finally dragged across its width with a brush or the surface otherwise
roughened by approved methods to give a nonskid finish.
   J.   Expansion Joints:

between the sidewalk and all structures, such as light standards, traffic light
standards, traffic poles, etc., which extend through the sidewalk.
      2.   Expansion joints, one inch (1") thick, shall be placed wherever
sidewalks abut against concrete driveways, concrete pavements, concrete curb
and/or concrete walks.
   K.   Curing:
      1.   The concrete shall be cured by protecting it against loss of
moisture, rapid temperature change and from rain, flowing water and mechanical
injury for a period of not less than three (3) days from the beginning of the
curing operation. Moist curing, waterproof paper, white polyethylene sheeting,
liquid membrane compound or a combination thereof may be used for curing.
Immediately after finishing operations have been completed, the entire surface
of the newly laid concrete shall be covered by the curing medium which is
applicable to local conditions and approved by the City Engineer. The edge of
concrete slabs exposed by the removal of forms shall be protected immediately
to provide these surfaces with continuous curing treatment equal to the method
selected for curing the slab surface and to prevent injury to pavement edges;
      2.   The use of a covering material which contains or becomes
contaminated with sugar in any form, tannic acid or any other substances
considered detrimental to Portland cement will not be permitted. The initial
curing medium shall be effective and shall be applied so as to prevent
checking, crackling and the appearance of dry spots in the surface of the
concrete. The contractor shall have the equipment needed for adequate curing at
hand and ready to install before actual concrete placement begins. In all cases
in which the curing medium requires the use of water, the curing shall have
prior right to all water supply. Failure to provide sufficient cover material
of the type selected, failure to maintain saturation for the entire curing
period in the moist-curing methods, lack of water to adequately care for both
curing and other requirements or other failures to comply with curing
requirements shall be cause for immediate suspension of concreting operations.
      3.   Moist curing shall be accomplished by covering of burlap, cotton
mats or other approved fabric mat, used singly or in combination. Curing mats
shall be thoroughly wet when applied and kept continuously wet and in intimate
contact with the pavement surface for the duration of the moist-curing period.
Other fabric mats shall conform in design and shall provide a curing medium at
least equal to cotton mats. Cotton mats, other fabric mats and burlap strips
shall be furnished in the widths or lengths, after shrinkage, required to cover
the entire width and edges of the pavement lane. Mats or burlap shall be lapped
at joints between adjacent sheets to prevent drying of this location. Moist-
curing, when used as initial curing, shall be continued for not less than
twenty four (24) hours.
      4.   The surface of the concrete shall be wetted with a fine spray of
water and then covered with the waterproof paper. The paper shall be in pieces
large enough to cover the entire width and edges of the slab and shall be
lapped not less than twelve inches (12"). Paper shall be adequately weighted to
prevent displacement or billowing due to wind. Paper folded down over the side
of the pavement edges shall be secured by continuous bank of earth. Tears or
holes appearing in the paper during the curing period shall be immediately
repaired. Waterproof paper for curing concrete shall conform to the current
ASTM or AASHO Specification for Waterproof Paper for Curing Concrete (C-171 and
M-139, respectively).
      5.   White polyethylene sheeting shall consist of a single sheet having a
thickness of not less than four (4) mills (0.004"). Moisture retention shall
conform to the requirements of ASTM Specifications - Designation C156; except,
that air-entraining Portland cement shall be used in the mortar. The material
shall be tested for tensile strength and elongation as prescribed in the
current ASTM Specifications Designation D-882-Method A.
      6.   Membrane curing compounds shall be the white pigmented type or
approved equal and conform to the requirements for the current AASHO Standard
Specifications for Liquid Membrane-Forming Compounds for Curing Concrete
(designation: M-148). The curing compound must be applied to cover the surface
completely and uniformly at a rate which will achieve the performance
requirements specified in AASHO Specifications M-148. This method of curing
shall be applied immediately behind the final finishing operation or after the
initial curing when a combination of methods are used. Failure to provide
complete and uniform coverage at the required rate will be cause for
discontinuance of this method of curing and the substitution of one of the
other approved methods. The compound shall be kept agitated to prevent the
pigment from settling. Special care shall be taken to apply the curing compound
to the pavement edges immediately after the forms have been removed.
   L.   Barricades and Lights: Sidewalks shall be properly barricaded and
lighted after finishing.
   M.   Space Adjacent to Sidewalks: After removal of forms, the space
alongside the sidewalk shall be filled with topsoil and leveled to prevent a
finished appearance.
   N.   Longitudinal and Transverse Joints: Longitudinal and transverse joints
shall be constructed as shown on the plans. (Ord. 0-23-79, 11-20-79)

         a.   Removal of dead branches, seriously damaged branches and
unbalanced branches and limbs.
         b.   Gradual removal of lower branches to provide a minimum overhead
clearance of eighteen feet (18') over sidewalks and twenty five feet (25') over
streets.
         c.   Removal of one leader or branch when forking of the main trunk
occurs at a height greater than fifteen feet (15') if the structural strength
or typically normal habit and beauty of the tree will be impaired by such
forking.
         d.   Lessen the height and width (drop crotching) of certain trees to
safeguard life and property and the tree from structural damage. This is due to
the tree's development and/or species where visual evidence has shown it to be
highly susceptible to damage from high winds and ice storms.
         e.   Shaping of young trees so that they will develop a single tall
straight trunk, a strong central framework or branch structure and a
symmetrical balanced crown.
         f.   Restore physiological balance between the root system and leaf
surface area at the time of planting.
         g.   Reasonable removal of limbs that seriously interfere with or
hinder proper development of adjacent parkway and/or private trees.
      3.   Pruning Tools:
         a.   All contractors, utilities or contractors employed by utilities
shall sterilize all pruning tools used on and between all trees on the City
parkways, rights of way and public places within the City to minimize the
spread of debilitating, deforming and fatal diseases on same.
         b.   All contractors, utilities or contractors working for utilities
shall not use climbing irons in trees on the City parkway or right of way for
any purpose other than removal of that tree or in an emergency.
         c.   All contractors, utilities or contractors working for utilities
shall not use climbing irons on any private property tree for any purpose other
than removal or for an emergency, due to the spread of disease that may occur
from this practice, not to mention the wounding of the bark on the tree.
      4.   Removal of Dangerous, Undesirable Trees and Limbs: Any tree or limb
of a tree which has become dead or decaying or broken and/or likely to fall on
or across any public way, on adjoining property or has been discarded as an
undesirable or deformed tree as applicable through subsection
7-3-4C of this Chapter shall be removed by the owner of the property on which
such tree stands or grows. Where the owner of the property has been properly
notified of such hazard or undesirable or deformed tree and fails to remove
same within thirty (30) days of such notification, the Director of Public Works
or authorized representative shall cause said tree or limb to be removed, and
the owner of the property shall be billed the City's cost for removing such
hazard or undesirable or deformed tree. (Ord. 0-28-90, 6-4-90; 1992 Code)
7-3-9: CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES AROUND TREES ON CITY PROPERTY:
   A.   During digging operations, no excavation or trench shall occur closer
than a distance of three (3) trunk diameters (measured at 41/2' above ground
level) to any tree. In no case shall an excavation be dug at the above-
specified minimum distance or less on more than one side of the parkway tree.
   B.   Tunneling must leave the top two feet (2') of soil undisturbed.
   C.   The Department of Public Works must first inspect and approve any
digging or trenching near a tree or trees according to specifications in
subsections A and B above. Such trenching can only be permitted for the repair
of existing utilities or installation of same with construction requirements
providing no other location alternatives or due to the nature of the materials
and/or installation procedures necessary. A diligent effort shall be made
during operation of construction equipment (end loader, trencher, back hoe,
etc.) to minimize root and trunk damage to trees and splitting of roots back
into the soil beyond the excavation.
   D.   Backfilling shall follow the criteria specified as follows:
      1.   Except as indicated in subsection D2 herein, soil removed in
tunneling or trenching must be used to backfill same and an attempt made to
return the backfill to its original compactness.
      2.   The Department of Public Works must inspect and approve sites where
gravel or similar material must be used in lieu of original soil backfill in a
trench or excavation within the mature tree's drip line. In cases where the
tree is a species intolerant to an alkaline soil, washed river gravel or
similar neutral material must be used in place of limestone gravel. Also, if
the intolerant tree species is immature, neutral gravel shall be used when the
excavation is located in the area that would eventually be covered by the
mature tree's crown. Finally, the top two feet (2') of the trench or excavation
must be filled with the same soil removed or its equivalent.
   E.   Soils and/or materials must not be stockpiled beneath the crowns of
parkway trees for a period longer than one week. Such aforementioned soil and
material shall not be placed around or against tree trunks.
   F.   Where fill must be added near trees, the finished grade (including sod)
shall be no more than six inches (6") above the original grade. The fill shall
be a good topsoil, loamy in texture and high in organic matter such as peat
moss, etc.
   G.   Care must be taken during construction activities not to damage trees
with any of the materials or machinery used on the job. Planking of tree trunks
with lumber of an adequate height and thickness and secured by wire, strapping
or rope shall be used to protect trees where damage is possible. All damage
must be immediately reported to the Department of Public Works. Low hanging
limbs interfering excessively with construction activities shall be reported to
the Department of Public Works for pruning or removal prior to the start of
construction.
   H.   Equipment or vehicles must not be repeatedly driven or parked beneath
the crowns of trees on City property.
   I.   The City reserves the right to stop a job and prevent further progress
where the above specifications are being violated. Where repeated and flagrant
violations occur, the contractor will forfeit his permit and be billed for
labor and material costs incurred in repairing any damage. (Ord. 0-28-90, 6-4-

thirty feet (30') of the nearest right-of-way line of any intersecting street,
they shall be maintained at a maximum height of two feet (2'), and they shall
be kept trimmed to the right-of- way line.
      2.   No person shall maintain any hedge, shrub or tree anywhere upon his
premises which interferes with the clear view of traffic by drivers approaching
an intersection.
      3.   No person shall allow a hedge or shrub on his premises to grow out
and interfere with pedestrian traffic in the public sidewalk (where one exists)
abutting his or her premises. (Ord. 0-28-90, 6-4-90)
7-3-11: PENALTIES:

more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense. Each day during
which a violation of this Chapter continues shall be considered a separate and
distinct violation. Imposition of any penalty for a violation of this Chapter
shall not be construed as a waiver of the right of the City to collect the
costs of removal of such nuisances in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter where it is necessary for the City to remove such nuisances as
hereinabove provided. (Ord. 0-28-90, 6-4-90; 1992 Code)

7-5-1: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The City has heretofore provided for the placement of public benches by
companies that acquire permits and otherwise conform with the provisions of
City ordinances; and
   B.   Upon the recommendation of the Northlake Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and the Director of Health and Inspectional Services of the City, a
survey and study was performed in order to evaluate the number, condition and
compliance of the public benches that had been placed throughout the City upon
the public right of way; and
   C.   As a result of that survey, it was noted that the number of benches and
the average number of violations of ordinances of the City and the condition of
the benches and their placement was generally of such a nature so as to create
a potentially hazardous and unsafe condition to the motoring and pedestrian
public utilizing the public right of way; and
   D.   The City Council is in receipt of a recommendation from the Northlake
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the City Director of Health and
Inspectional Services that the proliferation and activities related to the
placement of the public benches, frequently referred to as "ad benche", should
be discontinued, and that the City may provide sufficient public benches so as
to accommodate the transportation needs of the public; and
   E.   Based upon the information received, it is the findings and
determination of the City Council that the current provisions and procedures
relative to public benches have not been complied with and, given such
noncompliance, have resulted in potential danger to members of the public
utilizing the public right of way, both as to the safety and general condition
of the benches themselves and the location and the failure to procure necessary
insurance and permits, all of which necessitates that the City initiate action
by usurping the function of placing such public benches at places of
accommodation upon the public right of way within the City. (Ord. 0-01-87, 1-

prohibition shall apply to all benches, including those displaying advertising
matter, but shall not apply where the placement is with the prior written
direction or authorization of the corporate authorities of the City. (Ord. 0-
01-87, 1-19-87)
7-5-4: INJURY TO BENCHES PROHIBITED:
It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly damage, deface or otherwise
cause a public bench lawfully placed upon the public right of way to be
rendered unusable or unsafe for use by the general public. (Ord. 0-01-87, 1-19-
87)
7-5-5: EXISTING BENCHES:
Notwithstanding the effective date hereof, any permittee holding a validly
issued and authorized permit from the City for the placement of a public bench
within the right of way, upon a showing of the validity of such permit, shall
be allowed to leave such bench at its location for the duration of the term of
the permit; provided, said location conforms in all respects with the
ordinances of the City under which said permit was issued, until the earliest
occurrence of the expiration of such permit or April 30, 1987. (Ord. 0-01-87,
1-19-87)
7-5-6: PENALTIES:
Any person found to be in violation of the provisions of this Chapter shall be
fined in an amount not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each of
such violations. Each day that a violation is in existence shall constitute and
be deemed as a separate violation subject to the penalties provided herein.

   C.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this Article shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
where pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. (Ord. O-34-90, 6-18-90)

this Section.
   B.   Every telecommunications provider who has registered with the City
pursuant to subsection A of this Section has an affirmative duty to submit an

addresses within the City for telecommunications originating or received in the
City.
   B.   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this Chapter, the City infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all public
rights of way within the City by telecommunications retailers. Imposition of
the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this Chapter does not,
however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or imposition of any
fees otherwise authorized by law.
   C.   The City telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
by this Section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as set forth in
Section
7-9-4 of this Chapter. (Ord. O-44-97, 10-20-1997)

maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service address.
   B.   Unless otherwise approved by the City Council, the infrastructure
maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the
City not later than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in which
a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that the
telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed two percent (2%)
of the City infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse itself
for expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
   C.   Remittance of the Municipal infrastructure fee to the City shall be
accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the City, which shall
contain such information as the City may reasonably require.
   D.   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant to
this Chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the City. The charge imposed under subsection A
of this Section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this Chapter
shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for such services.
   E.   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee has
been paid that was not due under the provisions of this Chapter, whether as a
result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this Chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the City may request, and telecommunications
retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such credit. However, no
claim for such credit may be made more than three (3) years after the date of
the erroneous payment unless: 1) the credit is used only to offset a claim of
underpayment made by the City within the applicable statutory period of
limitations, and 2) the credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.
   F.   Amounts paid under this Chapter by telecommunications retailers shall
not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described
immediately below:

public utilities prescribed in section 2-202 of the Public Utilities Act.
   G.   The City shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books
and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this Chapter to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
City for the City infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the
amount of the City infrastructure maintenance fee due to the City by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the City plus five percent (5%) of
the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs
incurred by the City in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed five
percent (5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit.
Said sum shall be paid to the City within twenty one (21) days after the date
of issuance of an invoice for same.
   H.   The City Council or its designee may promulgate such further or
additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of this
Chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to time
and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered pursuant

for their stated terms except for any fees, charges or other compensation to
the extent waived. (Ord. O-44-97, 10-20-1997)

Any telecommunications provider who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or
refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be subject
to fine in accordance with the general penalty provisions of this Code. (Ord.
O-44-97, 10-20-1997)

further remedies that the City may have for enforcement of this Chapter. (Ord.
O-44-97, 10-20-1997)

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Chapter

provided for in this Chapter is subject to being lawfully imposed on the
telecommunications retailer and collected by the telecommunications retailer
from the customer.

location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a) ten (10) days
after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work not involving excavation for new construction or b) twenty five
(25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications
retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a permit
is required for work pursuant to section
7-10-4 of this chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection A of this

7-10-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights of way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights of way.
   B.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the city
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
city and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)
7-10-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
7-10-21 of this chapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)
7-10-8: INSURANCE:

      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the city.

(Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)
7-10-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city may, in the exercise of
sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which
shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The
amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
subsection C for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may
withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not
reimbursed the city for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period.
Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to the
security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the city may have. (Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)

foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right of way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right of way.
      6.   Minimum Cover Of Underground Facilities: Cover shall be provided and
maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for minimum
cover for the type of facility:

7-10-17: VEGETATION CONTROL:
   A.   Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   B.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
   C.   Chemical Use: Spraying of any type of brush killing chemicals will not
be permitted on rights of way unless the utility demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the city that such spraying is the only practicable method of
vegetation control. (Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)

a utility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the
rights of way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such
removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any city improvement in
or upon, or the operations of the city in or upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights of way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   C.   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The city retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights of

permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior
to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights of way of the city, the utility shall notify the city within
ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the city may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the city determines
that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and
welfare. In the event that the city does not direct the utility that abandoned
the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the
abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of
all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person. (Ord. O-27-
2007, 8-20-2007)
7-10-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the utility
shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain in a timely
manner and to the satisfaction of the city. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the city. Such cleanup and repair may be
required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any
other requirement to restore the right of way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project.
(Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)

with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
city of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken
for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the city of a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty eight
(48) hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)

of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this
chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The city shall decide whether a variance
is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance
request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city may authorize a variance
only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city may require the utility requesting the
variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)
7-10-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility who
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. O-27-2007, 8-20-2007)

before the requested collocation, approval shall be conditioned on the
replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of
the provider.
The City shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code
provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the
documentation to the applicant on or before the day the City denies an
application.
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the City and resubmit the
revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is sent
to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The City shall
approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial shall
require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the City's review period.
The applicant must notify the City in writing of its intention to proceed with
the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with
the revised application.
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited
in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the cure
requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the

      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the City shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the City must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the City fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the City's permit application form are submitted by the applicant
to the City.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the City sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the City;
or
         b.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      5.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the City shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the City may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The City may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the City makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or
the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable City codes

shall be subject to the applicable City Code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the City by personal
delivery at the City's designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked
on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including electronic mail.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The City may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City's electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such interference,
and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by
the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall
remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and
resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established
by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672
through 47 CFR 90.675.
The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Location: The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on City utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the City utility pole and on the top
of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies
with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable
codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a City ordinance, written policy adopted by the City, a comprehensive plan
or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-
way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this chapter, a wireless
provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the City, provided the City may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in the City's zoning ordinance.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
the City's provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the City grants an extension in writing to the applicant. (Ord. O-16-
2018, 7-23-2018)

dangerous, unsafe or unsanitary.
   C.   Application of Other Provisions:

therein, which may be caused, directly or indirectly, by the enforcement of
this Section shall be done in accordance with applicable sections of the
Building Code of the City 1 .

establishment or conversion of a multi-family dwelling in any zone except where
permitted by the zoning law 2 , nor the continuation of such nonconforming use

   D.   Conflict with Other Ordinances:
      1.   Except as provided in subsection B2 of this Section
8-1F-3-3, in any case where a provision of this Section is found to be in
conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety or health
ordinance or code of this City existing on the effective date hereof, the
provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and
protection of the safety and health of the people shall prevail.
      2.   In any case where a provision of this Section
8-1F-3 is found to be in conflict with a provision of any other ordinance or
code of this City existing on the effective date hereof which established a
lower standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and health of the
people, the provisions of this Section shall prevail, and such other ordinances
or codes are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent that they may be
found in conflict with this Section. (Ord. O-52-89, 11-6-89)

8-9-4: INSPECTION BY CITY:
   A.   Each multi-family rental building, and each dwelling unit within the
building shall be subject to inspection for compliance with all applicable
regulations. A license shall be denied if the property has been inspected and
is not in compliance with this code. In such a case, the licensee may apply for
a conditional license.
   B.   Initial and subsequent annual licensing inspections shall include the
building exterior, common areas, basement and of the individual dwelling units.
   C.   The owner as designated agent will be given at least thirty (30) days'
notice by regular mail prior to any inspection being conducted. Upon receipt of
the notice of inspection, the owner shall notify the tenant, on a form provided
by the city, of the date and time of the inspection by either placing the
completed form under or on the door of the dwelling unit at least seventy two
(72) hours prior to the inspection. The form shall contain a certification that
the owner has served the notice as set forth in this subsection. Each notice
shall inform the owner and occupant of their right to refuse to consent to the
inspection and to require the city to obtain an administrative search warrant.
   D.   If any owner, manager, tenant or other person in control of a multi-
family rental residential structure or dwelling unit fails or refuses to
consent to free access and entry to the property or dwelling unit for any
inspection pursuant to this chapter, the building official may apply to the
circuit court for an administrative warrant or other appropriate court order
authorizing such inspection. Such an application shall not be a waiver of the
city's right to seek other remedies pursuant to this chapter.
   E.   When a licensing inspection reveals any violation, a time period for
compliance shall be set by the building official in accordance with city
property maintenance code. The code official shall send notice of the
violations and the compliance period to the property owner or the listed
property agent by regular U.S. mail at the address provided on the most recent
license application. The notice shall include the following:
      1.   Identification of the property.
      2.   A statement listing the violations and applicable codes sections.
      3.   The time period for compliance.
      4.   An explanation that if all violations have not been corrected within
the compliance time period the license is subject to revocation and nonrenewal.
   F.   A licensing reinspection will be conducted at the request of the owner
or the owners.
   G.   The building official shall, prior to entering an occupied apartment,
give the owner or manager a reasonable opportunity to be present during the
inspection. Unless otherwise specified in a court order or warrant, the
building official will not inspect or search any personal property of the
occupant. The building official, while performing the duties of office, will
otherwise fully consider the privacy and dignity of the occupant and will not
enter or open closets, medicine cabinets or the other closed cabinets or
lockers unless the inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that to do so
would establish evidence of code violations. If a resident desires to be
present for an inspection and it would result in an unusual hardship for that
resident to be present during regular city business hours, the building
official shall attempt to conduct the inspection at a time reasonably
convenient to the resident. (Ord. O-19-98, 4-20-1998)
8-9-5: CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for the owner or landlord of any multi-family
building to lease a dwelling unit contained therein without having first
tendered to the lessee a valid license for the dwelling. (Ord. O-19-98, 4-20-
1998)
   B.   (Rep. by Ord. O-46-98, 9-21-1998)
   C.   Where no consent has been given to enter or inspect any property, no
entry or inspection shall be made without the procurement of a warrant from the
circuit court of Cook County. The court may consider any of the following
factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as
to whether a warrant shall issue:
      1.   Eyewitness account of violation.
      2.   Citizen complaints.
      3.   Tenant complaints.

      10.   Documented violations of similar properties in the area.
      11.   Passage of time since last inspection.
      12.   Previous violation on the property.
Cause of issuance of a warrant shall be deemed to exist in light of reasonable
legislative and administrative standards which show that there is reason to
believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to a particular
property in violation of a city ordinance.
   D.   The city does not guarantee the condition of any property which is the
subject matter of this chapter, and the city is not responsible for any claims
arising out of the subject property or the condition thereof. (Ord. O-19-98, 4-
20-1998)
8-9-6: REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
   A.   Whenever, upon inspection of a multi-family dwelling for an initial
license or renewal of a license under the provisions of this section, the
building official finds that conditions or practices exist which are in
violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any applicable provisions of
this code, or of any applicable rules or regulations pursuant thereto, the
building official shall serve the owner or operator with notice of such
violation or violations. Such notice shall state that unless the violations
cited are corrected within a reasonable time of not less than seven (7) days,
except for emergency situations, the license may be suspended.
   B.   At the end of the time the building official has allowed for correction
of any violation cited, the building official shall reinspect the multi-family
dwelling and if he determines that such conditions have not been corrected, he
may issue an order suspending the license to take effect five (5) days
following service upon the landlord unless, in the interim, the owner or
manager requests, in writing, a hearing.
   C.   Any person whose license for a multi-family dwelling is subject to
suspension pursuant to a suspension order shall be entitled to a hearing on the
suspension action by filing with the city clerk, a written request for a
hearing by the mayor within five (5) business days following the receipt of the
suspension order. Upon receipt of said request, a hearing shall be scheduled to
be held by the mayor at a date not more than ten (10) business days thereafter.
Upon completion of the hearing, the mayor may either:
      1.   Confirm the suspension; or
      2.   Suspend the suspension and allow additional compliance time; or
      3.   Rescind the suspension.
   D.   If no petition for reconsideration of a suspension order is filed as
provided in subsection C of this section, then the suspension order is filed as
provided in this section, then the suspension order shall remain in effect
until the violations in question have been corrected, as determined by the
building official upon inspection of the structure.
   E.   In the event a license is suspended, and such suspension is affirmed
after hearing, if any, during the period of suspension:
      1.   No existing rental agreement shall be renewed and no new rental
agreement shall be entered into with respect to any unit located within the
dwelling.
      2.   The city shall have the right to seek enforcement of any other
applicable law. (Ord. O-19-98, 4-20-1998)

structure or a commercial or industrial unit or structure complies with the

determines that there exists unsafe or life threatening conditions or that the
unit or structure of occupancy, the buyer(s) must execute a checklist of
required repairs, indicating that he/they understand what is required of them,

The city will then issue the inspection and transfer stamp and a temporary
occupancy permit.
   B.   The city may extend a temporary certificate of occupancy for an
additional period of up to six (6) months provided that this new owner, agent
or person in charge of such unit or structure has completed or corrected fifty
percent (50%) or more of all repairs required by the city.

shall not be responsible for any claims arising out of the property or the
condition thereof. The city does not warrant that all deficiencies are listed
in the inspection report and does not warrant anything as to the condition of
the property or the liability thereof.

agent under the provisions of this section shall be deemed to consent to the
continuation of the agent's designation for the purposes of this section until

ABATEMENT PROCEEDINGS:
   A.   The following buildings and structures are hereby declared to be public
nuisances subject to abatement proceedings under this section:
      1.   A building or structure found to be vacant and open after the
effective date of an order to secure and enclose issued by the circuit court of
Cook County or the administrative hearing officer within the previous twelve
(12) months, unless stayed by the circuit court of Cook County;
      2.   A building or structure that contains any violation of a health,
fire, electrical, plumbing, building or zoning provision of this code which is
imminently dangerous and hazardous;
      3.   A building or structure for which the costs of the repairs necessary
to bring the building or structure into compliance with applicable laws would
exceed the market value of the building or structure after the repairs have
been made, or when the owner cannot show that it has readily available and
sufficient assets to make such repairs or where such repairs otherwise are
economically infeasible; or
      4.   A building or structure where an owner or mortgagee has failed to
correct the code violation(s) that form the basis of an adverse order or
judgment involving that building or structure, issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction or the administrative hearing officer, within sixty (60) days of
entry, unless such adverse order or judgment has been stayed by the circuit
court of Cook County. For the purposes of this section "vacant" shall be
defined as provided in subsection
8-15-16H of this chapter for a mortgagee, for the purposes of this chapter
"vacant" shall be defined as provided in section
8-15-2 of this chapter for owners; and "open" refers to a building that has any
door, window or wall missing or unsecured, or has any other opening so as to
allow entry by a human being.
   B.   The city attorney is authorized to bring an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction to abate a public nuisance described in this section. If
the court finds that the county or the city has established by a preponderance
of the evidence that the building or structure identified in the notice is a
public nuisance as described in this section, the court shall enter an order of
abatement which requires the owner or owners of record, including beneficial
owners of any Illinois land trust, within the time frame specified in the
order, to take all reasonable measures necessary to abate the public nuisance.
The court's order of abatement may include, but is not limited to: correcting
all code violations; altering, repairing or improving the building or
structure, rendering the building or structure unfit for human use or
habitation; vacating or enclosing the building or structure; removing or
demolishing the building or structure. If requested by the city and reasonable
in light of the magnitude of the harm caused or which can reasonably be
expected to be caused by the nuisance, the market value of the property in its
current condition and the extent to which the defendant has failed to take
effective measures to abate the nuisance, the court may enter an order which
provides for:
      1.   Forfeiture to the city of all of the defendant's rights, title and
interest in the real estate; or
      2.   Authorization to the first or senior mortgagee, as a receiver, to
take possession of the property and bring the property into compliance with
this code.
   C.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the issuance of an order
of forfeiture of all of the defendant's rights, title and interest in the real
estate or the issuance of an order authorizing the first or senior mortgagee to
take possession of the property and to bring the property into compliance with
this code shall be appropriate for any property that is determined to be a
nuisance under this section. Whenever such an order of forfeiture authorization
is issued under this section with respect to a vacant building or a building
containing four (4) or fewer residential units, the holder of the first or
senior mortgage or lien on the property, disregarding any more senior mortgages
or liens held by a unit of government, shall, beginning sixty (60) days after
the date the order is issued, be liable for any code violations on the property
on and after that date, unless the holder has waived its rights under the
mortgage or lien; provided that the sixty (60) day period after which liability
attaches may be extended by an administrative hearing officer or court upon a
showing that the mortgage or lienholder has exercised reasonable diligence in
abating the nuisance and that additional time is needed to complete the
abatement. The holder of such a mortgage or lien shall have the right to take
possession of the property in order to effect necessary repairs beginning on
the date that an order of forfeiture issues. In any case in which an order of
forfeiture is sought for property involving a vacant building or a building
containing four (4) or fewer residential units, the holder of any first or
senior mortgage or lien, disregarding any more senior mortgage or lien held by
a unit of government, shall be given notice and an opportunity to intervene as
a party.
   D.   For any building or structure that is a public nuisance subject to
abatement proceedings under this section, the owner, the owner's agent for
purpose of managing or controlling rents on the building or structure, the
holder of a mortgage or lien with a right to possession of the building or
structure and any other person or mortgagee managing or controlling the
building or structure shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each day the
nuisance has existed until the nuisance is abated. The amount of any fine
imposed in any proceeding involving a building or structure that is a public
nuisance under this section, the cost of the repairs, alterations, improvements
or vacating and enclosing, or removal and demolition by the city, and the costs
of bringing the abatement proceeding under this section into compliance,
including inspector's and attorney fees, shall be recoverable from the owner or
owners and shall be a lien on the property upon which the building or structure
is or was located and shall also be enforceable against any person or mortgagee
against whom the order issues as provided by law. Any lien created under this
chapter may, upon showing of good cause, be waived by the city. The lien for
the costs of repairs, alterations, improvements, demolition, receivership,
vacating or enclosing shall be a first lien upon the real estate and the rents
and issues thereof, and shall be superior to all prior assignments of rents and
all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes, and shall be enforced
pursuant to applicable law. No license shall be issued relating to the property
subject to such lien until the lien is satisfied or, upon a showing of good
cause, the lien is waived by the city. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent
the city from seeking other remedies for code violations through the use of any
other administrative procedure or court proceeding.
   E.   Any property forfeited to the city under this section may be disposed
of as authorized by the city.
   F.   All fees and fines laid out in this section are in addition to any fees
and fines in this code. (Ord. O-25-2011, 12-19-2011)

less than two feet by two feet (2' x 2') in size on the front of the building.
The notice shall be dated as of the date of the posting and shall state that
unless the building is demolished, repaired or enclosed and unless any garbage,
debris and other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials are
removed so that an immediate and continuing hazard to the city no longer
exists, then the building may be demolished, repaired or enclosed or any
garbage, debris and other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials may be removed by the city. Not later than thirty (30) days following
the posting of the notice, the city shall do the following:
      1.   Cause to be sent, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a
notice to all owners of record of the property, the beneficial owners of any
Illinois land trust having title to the property and all lienholders of record

building or remove any garbage, debris and other hazardous, noxious or
unhealthy substances or materials if that action is not taken by the owner or
owners or lienholders of record.

notice setting forth:
         a.   The address of the building or description of the real estate
sufficient for its identification;
         b.   A statement that the property is open and vacant and constitutes
an immediate and continuing hazard to the city; and
         c.   A statement that the city intends to demolish, repair or enclose
the building or remove any garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or
unhealthy substances or materials if the owner or owners or lienholders of
record fail to do so. This notice shall be published for three (3) consecutive
days.
      3.   Cause to be filed in the office of the recorder of deeds, a notice
setting forth: a) the address of the building or a description of the real
estate sufficient for its identification; and b) a statement that the city has
initiated an action under this section to cause the demolition, repair or
enclosure of the building or the removal of garbage, debris or other hazardous,
noxious or unhealthy substances or materials located on the property if the
owner or owners or lienholders of record fail to do so. If the building is not
demolished, repaired or enclosed or the garbage, debris or other hazardous,
noxious or unhealthy substances or materials are not removed, within thirty
(30) days of mailing the notice described in subsection A1 of this section or
within thirty (30) days of the last day of publication of the notice, whichever
is later, the city shall cause to be sent, by mail, a final determination to
the owners of record, the beneficial owners of any Illinois land trust having
title to the property, and all lienholders of record in the property, which
provides notice that the city has determined that the necessary demolition,
repair, enclosure or removal action has not been taken and that the building
remains open and vacant and an immediate and continuing hazard to the city. The
final determination shall include a statement that, unless a hearing is sought
under this section before the circuit court of Cook County to object to the
proposed actions of the city and a copy of the complaint served on the city
clerk within ten (10) days of the mailing of the final determination, the city
intends to exercise its power to demolish, repair or enclose the buildings or
to remove any garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy
substances or materials.
The city may proceed to demolish, repair or enclose a building or remove any
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials under this subsection within a one hundred twenty (120) day period
following the date of the mailing of the notice described in subsection A1 of
this section if the city determines that the demolition, repair, enclosure or
removal of any garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy
substances or materials is necessary to remedy the immediate and continuing
hazard. If, however, before the city proceeds with any of the actions
authorized by this section, any person or mortgagee who has sought a hearing
under this section before a court and has served a copy of the complaint on the
city clerk, then the city shall not proceed with demolition, repair, enclosure
or removal of garbage, debris or other substances until the court determines
that action is necessary to remedy the hazard and issues an order authorizing
the city to do so.
Following the demolition, repair or enclosure of a building or removal of
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials under this section the city may file a notice of lien against the
real estate for the cost of the demolition, repair, enclosure or removal within
one hundred eighty (180) days after the repair, demolition, enclosure or
removal occurred, for the cost and expense incurred, in the office of the
recorder of deeds. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement
setting forth: a) a description of the real estate, such as address or other
description of the property, sufficient for its identification; b) the expenses
incurred by the city in undertaking the remedial actions authorized by this
section; c) the date or dates that the expenses were incurred by the city or
its designee; d) a statement by the city that the building was open and vacant

notice was sent by certified mail to the owners of record, and that notice was
published in accordance with this subsection; and f) a statement as to when and

8-18-4: RENTAL AGREEMENTS:
   A.   
      1.   A rental agreement complying with the requirements of this chapter
shall be executed for the rental of all dwelling units within the City
regardless of the duration of the tenancy herein. The tenant and landlord may
include in a rental agreement terms and conditions not prohibited by this
chapter and other rules of law including rent, term of the agreement and other
provisions governing the rights and obligations of the parties.
      2.   All rental agreements for leases of dwelling units subject to this
chapter shall contain the full names of all occupants of the dwelling unit
leased or to be leased under the rental agreement. The individual occupancy of
the dwelling unit shall in no case exceed the maximum occupancy permitted
elsewhere in applicable building codes for that size unit.
      3.   Rent is to be payable at the time and place agreed upon by the
parties. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the dwelling unit at the
beginning of any term of one month or less and otherwise in equal monthly
installments at the beginning of each month. Unless otherwise agreed, rent
shall be uniformly apportionable from day to day.
      4.   Unless otherwise agreed, the tenancy shall be week to week in the
case of a tenant who pays weekly rent and, in all other cases, month to month.
   B.   
      1.   If the landlord does not sign and deliver a written rental
agreement, acceptance of rent without reservation by the landlord gives the
rental agreement the same effect as if it has been signed and delivered by the
landlord.
      2.   If the tenant does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement,
acceptance of possession and payment of rent without reservation gives the
rental agreement the same effect as if it had been signed and delivered by the
tenant.
      3.   If a rental agreement given effect by the operation of this section
provides for a term longer than one year, it is effective for only one year.
   C.   Prohibited Provisions. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, no
rental agreement may provide that the tenant or the landlord:
      1.   Agrees to waive or to forego rights or remedies under this chapter,
Illinois state law, or federal law;
      2.   Authorizes a confession of judgment, or any entry of a judgment by a
court without notice or a trial for any claim including but not limited to
debts, liabilities, damages, and obligations, on a claim arising out of the
rental agreement;
      3.   Agrees to a waiver of: service, summons, copy of complaint,
petition, right to notice, motion or entry of appearance;
      4.   Agrees to non-disparagement clause that limits any written or oral

indirectly, made by tenants regarding the landlord, property, management,
staff, officers, directors, representatives, investors, shareholders,
administrators, affiliates, employees, affiliated corporations, divisions, or
subsidiaries;
      5.   Agrees to the limitation of any liability of the tenant or landlord
arising under law or to indemnify the tenant or landlord for that liability or
the costs connected therewith;
      6.   Agrees to waive any written termination of tenancy notice or manner
of service thereof provided under state law or this chapter;
      7.   Agrees to waive the right of any party to a trial by jury;

rules, statute or ordinance;
      9.   Agrees that either party may cancel or terminate a rental agreement
at a different time or within a shorter time period than the other party,
unless such provision is disclosed in a separate written notice;
      10.   Agrees that a tenant shall pay a charge, fee or penalty in excess
of $10.00 per month for the first $1,500.00 in monthly rent plus five percent
(5%) per month for any amount in excess of $1500.00 in monthly rent for the
late payment of rent;
      11.   Agrees that, if a tenant pays rent before a specified date or
within a specified time period in the month, the tenant shall not receive a
discount or reduction in the rental amount in excess of $10.00 per month for
the first $1500.00 in monthly rent plus five percent (5%) per month for any
amount in excess of $1500.00 in monthly rent.
      A provision prohibited by this section included in a rental agreement is
unenforceable. If a landlord deliberately uses a rental agreement containing
any provision known by them to be prohibited, the tenant may recover actual
damages sustained by them or two (2) months' rent, whichever is greater.
   D.   Disclosure of Costs. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, no
rental agreement may provide that the landlord:
      1.   Impose fees in excess of reasonable expenses incurred by the
landlord in connection with the dwelling unit;
      2.   Pay the cost of a utility for a dwelling unit in which the utility
service is individually metered to the dwelling unity and the tenant is

damages sustained by them or two (2) months' rent, whichever is greater. (Ord.
O-20-2020, 12-7-2020)
8-18-5: TENANT RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS:

bearing requirements of the City Code;

sound repair;
         q.   Failure to maintain the basement or cellar in a safe and sanitary
condition;
         r.   Failure to maintain facilities, equipment or chimneys in safe and
sound working condition;
         s.   Failure to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water;
         t.   Failure to exterminate insects, rodents or other pests;
         u.   Failure to supply or maintain facilities for refuse disposal;
         v.   Failure to prevent the accumulation of garbage, trash, refuse or

appurtenances and appliances in good operating condition and repair;
         y.   Failure to provide or maintain electrical systems, circuits,
receptacles and devices as required by the City Code;
         z.   Failure to maintain and repair any equipment which the landlord
supplies or is required to supply by the City Code;
         aa.   Failure to maintain the dwelling unit and common areas in a fit
and habitable condition in compliance with the City Code and all applicable,
state statutes, federal laws and state and federal regulations.    
      If there is material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental
agreement or with this section which renders the premises not reasonably fit
and habitable, the tenant may deliver, at any time of month, a written notice
to the landlord specifying the breach and that the rental agreement will
terminate on a date not less than fourteen (14) days after receipt of notice
unless the breach is remedied by the landlord prior to the expiration of the
notice. During that fourteen (14) day period, the tenant may withhold some or
all of the rent until the breach is remedied. If the breach is not remedied
prior to the expiration of the notice, the rental agreement shall terminate as
provided in the notice. The tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by
the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of the
tenant's family, or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent. If
possession shall not be so delivered, then the tenant's notice shall be deemed
withdrawn and the lease shall remain in full force and effect. If the rental
agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return security.
      Except as provided in this chapter, the tenant may recover damages and
obtain injunctive relief for any material noncompliance by the landlord with
the rental agreement or with this section.
   B.   Failure to Provide Essential Services.
      1.   If, contrary to the rental agreement, the landlord fails to supply
heat, running water, hot water, electricity, gas or plumbing, the tenant shall
deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the service to be restored.
If the landlord fails to correct the condition within 24 hours after being
notified by the tenant, the tenant may:
         a.   Withhold from the monthly rent an amount that reasonably reflects
the reduced value of the premises due to the material noncompliance or failure;
         b.   Procure reasonable amounts of heat, running water, hot water,
electricity, gas or plumbing service and, upon presentation to the landlord of
paid receipts, deduct the cost from their rent;    
         c.   Recover damages based upon the diminution in the fair rental
value of the dwelling unit and reasonable attorney fees;
         d.   Procure substitute housing, in which case the tenant is excused
from paying rent for the period of noncompliance. The tenant may recover the
cost of reasonable value of the substitute housing up to an amount equal to the
monthly rent and reasonable fees.
         e.   In addition, the tenant may:
         i.   Terminate the rental agreement by written notice to the landlord
if the material noncompliance or failure persists for more than 72 hours after
the tenant has notified the landlord; provided, however, that no termination
shall be allowed if the failure is due to the inability of the utility provider
to provide service. If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall
return all security deposits thereon and tenant shall deliver possession of the
dwelling unit to the landlord within 30 days after the expiration of the 72
hour time period specified in the notice. If possession shall not be so
delivered, the tenant's notice shall be deemed withdrawn and the lease shall
remain in full force and effect.
      2.   Tenants may not exercise their rights under this section if the
condition was caused by the inability of a utility supplier to provider service
or by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of
the tenant's family, or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent.
   C.   Fire or Casualty.
      1.   If the dwelling unit or premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or
casualty to an extent that enjoyment of the dwelling unit is substantially
impaired, the tenant may:
      2.   Immediately vacate the premises and notify the landlord in writing
within fourteen (14) days thereafter of the tenant's intention to terminate the
rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the date
of fire or casualty;
      3.   If continued occupancy is lawful, vacate any part of the dwelling
unit rendered unusable by the fire or casualty, in which case the tenant's
liability for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the fair
rental value of the dwelling unit;
      4.   If the tenant desires to continue the tenancy and if the landlord
has promised or begun work to repair the damage or destruction but fails to
carry out the work to restore the dwelling unit or common area diligently and
within a reasonable time, the tenant may notify the landlord in writing within
14 days after the tenant becomes aware that work is not being carried out
diligently or within a reasonable time of the tenant's intention to terminate
the rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the
date of the fire or casualty.
      5.   If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all
security deposit. Accounting for rent in the event of a termination,
apportionment shall be made of the date of the fire or casualty.
      6.   A tenant may not exercise remedies in this section if the fire or
casualty damage was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of
the tenant, a member of the tenant's family or a person on the premises with
the tenant's consent.
   D.   Minor and Other Repairs.
      1.   If the landlord fails to comply with the rental agreement or with
the requirements of this section and the reasonable cost of compliance does not
exceed $500.00 or one-half month's rent, whichever amount is greater, the
tenant may recover damages for the breach or may notify the landlord in writing
of their intention to correct the condition at the landlord's expense. If the
landlord fails to comply within fourteen (14) days after being notified by the
tenant in writing or as promptly as conditions require in case of emergency,
the tenant may have work done in a workmanlike manner and, after submitting to
the landlord a paid bill from an appropriate tradesman or supplier, deduct from
their rent the amount therefore, not exceeding the limits specified in this
section.
      2.   A tenant shall not repair at the landlord's expense if the condition
was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a
member of the tenant's family, or other person on the premises with the
tenant's consent.
      3.   Before correcting a condition affecting facilities shared by more
than one dwelling unit, the tenant shall notify all other affected tenants of
their plans and so arrange the work as to create the least practicable
inconvenience to the other tenants.
      4.   For the purposes of mechanics' lien laws, repairs performed or
materials furnished pursuant to this subsection shall be construed as having
been performed or furnished pursuant to authority of or written permission of
the landlord.
      5.   If the landlord fails to comply with the rental agreement or with
the requirements of this section, the tenant may, where the condition has been
cited as a code violation by the City, notify the landlord in writing of the
tenant's intention to withhold from the monthly rent an amount which reasonably
reflects the reduced value of the premises. If the landlord fails to correct
the condition within fourteen (14) days after being notified by the tenant in
writing, the tenant may, during the time such failure continues, deduct from
the rent the stated amount. A tenant shall not withhold rent under this
subsection if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or
omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or other person on the
premises with the tenant's consent.
   E.   Rights of Possession and Entry.
      1.   If the landlord fails to deliver possession of the dwelling unit to
the tenant in compliance with the rental agreement, rent abates until
possession is delivered and the tenant may:
      2.   Upon written notice to the landlord, terminate rental agreement and,
upon termination, the landlord shall immediately return all security deposits;
      3.   Demand performance of the rental agreement and, if the tenant
elects, maintain an action for possession of the dwelling unit against the
landlord or any person wrongfully in possession and recover the damages
sustained by them.
      4.   An aggrieved person may recover from the person withholding
possession an amount not more than two (2) months' rent or twice the actual
damages sustained by them, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney fees.
      5.   If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an
unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful, but
which have the effect of harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive
relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental
agreement. In each case, the tenant may recover an amount equal to not more
than two (2) months' rent or twice the damages sustained by them, whichever is
greater, and reasonable attorney fees.
   F.   Tenant Obligations. The tenant shall:
      1.   Comply with all obligations imposed upon tenants by provisions of
the codes applicable to the dwelling unit;
      2.   Keep that part of the premises that they occupy and use as safe as
the condition of the premises permits;
      3.   Dispose from their dwelling unit all ashes, rubbish, garbage and
other waste in a clean and safe manner;
      4.   Keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or used by the
tenant as clean as their condition permits;
      5.   Use, in a reasonable manner, all electrical, plumbing, sanitary,
heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other facilities and appliances,
including elevators, in the premises;
      6.   Not deliberately destroy, deface, damage, impair or remove any part
of the premises or knowingly permit any person to do so;
      7.   Conduct themselves and require other persons on the premises with
their consent to conduct themselves in a manner that will not disturb their
neighbors' peaceful enjoyment of premises;    
      8.   Unless otherwise agreed, only occupy their dwelling unit as a
dwelling unit. (Ord. O-20-2020, 12-7-2020)
8-18-6: LANDLORD RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS:
In addition to any remedies provided under state and federal law, a landlord
shall have the remedies specified in this section under the circumstances
herein set forth.
   A.   Landlord Rights and Remedies.
      1.   Rights of Entry. A tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to
the landlord to enter the dwelling unit:
         a.   To inspect the premises or conduct inspections authorized or
required by any government agency;
         b.   To make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or
improvements, including where such work elsewhere in the building requires such
access;
         c.   To supply necessary or agreed services;   
         d.   To exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers,
mortgagees, workmen or contractors;
         e.   To exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective tenants 60 days or
less prior to the expiration of the existing rental agreement;
         f.   To determine a tenants' compliance with provisions in the rental
agreement.
         The landlord may only enter at reasonable times, except in case of
emergency. An entry between 8:00am and 8:00pm or at any other time expressly
requested by the tenant shall be presumed reasonable.
         A landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant
in case of emergency.
         The landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass
the tenant. Except in cases of emergency the landlord shall give the tenant at
least two (2) days' notice of their intent to enter. Such notice shall be
provided directly to each dwelling unit by mail, telephone, written notice to
the dwelling unit or by other reasonable means designed in good faith to
provide notice to the tenant. If access is required because of repair work for
common facilities or multiple apartments, a general notice may be given by the
landlord to all potentially affected tenants that entry may be required. In
cases where access is authorized due to emergency the landlord shall give the
tenant notice of entry within two (2) days after such entry.
         If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain
injunctive relief to compel access or terminate the rental agreement. In either
case, the landlord may recover damages and reasonable attorney fees.
         If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or entry in an unreasonable
manner or repeated unreasonable demands for entry, which have the effect of
harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the
recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental agreement. In each case, the
tenant may recover an amount equal to one month's rent or twice the damage
sustained, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney fees.
      2.   Rules and Regulations. The landlord may adopt general rules or
regulations concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of the premises. They
enforceable only if in writing and:
         a.   Their purpose is to promote the convenience, safety and welfare
of the tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord's property from abusive
use or make a fair distribution of services and facilities among tenants;
         b.   They are reasonably related to the purpose for which they are
adopted;
         c.   They apply to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;
         d.   They are sufficiently explicit to fairly inform the tenant of
what they must or must not do to comply;
         e.   They are not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the
landlord;
         f.   They are not for the purpose of preventing tenants to assemble or
otherwise communicate amongst each other about the premises;
         g.   The tenant has written notice of them at the time they enter into
the rental agreement.
         A rule or regulation adopted after the tenant enters into the rental
agreement that substantially modifies their bargain is not enforceable unless
the tenant consents in writing.
   B.   Landlord Remedies: Every landlord shall have the remedies specified in
this section for the following circumstances:
      1.   Failure to Pay Rent: If all or any portion of rent is unpaid when
due and the tenant fails to pay the unpaid rent within five days after written
notice by the landlord of the landlord's intention to terminate the rental
agreement if rent is not so paid, the landlord may terminate the rental
agreement. Provided. however, that at any time prior to the issuance of any
order of possession or an eviction order made pursuant to Article IX of the
Illinois Code of Civil Procedure. 735 ILCS 5/9-101 et seq. the tenant has a
one-time right to cure the non-payment of rent by paying the landlord unpaid
rent, duly owed from the date of the notice of termination to the date of
payment, together with all filing fees and costs paid by the landlord and all
fees and costs expended by the landlord for service of process, but not
including attorney fees. If the tenant so cures, then the order of possession
or eviction order shall be vacated, and the case dismissed upon motion by
either the landlord or the tenant. If a landlord does not provide a total
amount due, the tenant shall be obligated to provide only the amount of rent
due from the notice to the date of judgment. Nothing in this subsection shall
affect a landlord's obligation to provide notice of termination of tenancy in
subsidized housing as required under federal law or regulations. A landlord may
also maintain an action for rent and/or damages without terminating the rental
agreement.
      2.   Material Noncompliance: If there is material noncompliance by a
tenant with a rental agreement, the landlord may deliver written notice to the
tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the
rental agreement will terminate upon a date no less than thirty (30) days after
receipt of the notice, unless the breach is remedied by the tenant prior to the
expiration of the notice. If the breach is not remedied prior to the expiration
of the notice, the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice.
The landlord may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any material
noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement.
      3.   Abandonment: Abandonment of the dwelling unit shall have occurred
when:
         a.   Actual notice has been provided to the landlord by the tenant
indicating the tenant's intention not to return to the dwelling unit;
         b.   All persons entitled under a rental agreement have been absent
from the unit for a period of 32 days or for one rental period when the rental
agreement is for less than a month and such persons have removed their personal
property from the premises and rent for that period is unpaid.
         Abandonment of the dwelling unit shall not be deemed to have occurred
if any person entitled to occupancy has provided the landlord with written
notice indicating that they still intend to occupy the unit and make full
payments of all amounts due to the landlord.
         If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make a
good faith effort to rent it at a fair rental value. This shall include the
acceptance of reasonable subleases. If the landlord succeeds in renting the
dwelling unit at a fair rental, the tenant shall only be liable for the amount
by which the rent due from the date of abandonment to the termination of the
initial rental agreement exceeds the fair rental subsequently received by the
landlord from the date of abandonment to the termination of the initial rental
agreement. If the landlord makes a good faith effort to rent the dwelling unit
at a fair rental and is unsuccessful, the tenant shall be liable for the rent
due for the period of the rental agreement. The tenant shall also be liable for
reasonable advertising and redecoration costs incurred by the landlord in re-
renting the dwelling unit.
         Unless otherwise agreed, if, upon termination of a tenancy including,
but not limited to, a termination after expiration of a lease or by surrender
or abandonment of the premises, a tenant has left personal property on the
premises, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has abandoned
such personal property, the landlord may notify the tenant in writing of their
demand that such property be removed within dates set forth in the notice, but
no less than 14 days after delivery of the notice;
         If such property is not removed within the time specified, the
property may be sold at a public sale or at a commercially reasonable private
sale. The proceeds, less reasonable costs incurred by such sale or storage,
shall be held by the landlord for the tenant for one year. If the tenant does
not claim the proceeds within one year, the proceeds shall be the property of
the landlord. Any public sale, authorized under the provisions of this section,
shall be conducted pursuant to law in such instances made and provided;
         If the tenant has left personal property which is reasonably
determined by the landlord to be valueless or of such little value that the
cost of storing and conducting a sale would probably exceed the amount that
would be realized from such a sale, the landlord must include in such notice
that the landlord intends to destroy or otherwise dispose of the property. If
such notice is given and property is not removed within the time specified, the
landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the property.
         After sending written notice, the landlord shall store all personal
property of the tenant in a place of safekeeping and shall exercise reasonable
care of the property but shall not be responsible to the tenant for any loss
not caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act or omission. The
landlord may elect to store the property in or about the previously vacated
premises. The landlord shall be entitled to the cost of storage for the period
of time that the property has remained in their safekeeping. In such case the
storage shall not exceed commercially reasonable storage rates. If the tenant's
property is removed to a commercial storage company, the storage cost shall
include the actual charge for such storage and removal from the premises to the
place of storage.
         After the landlord's notice, if the tenant makes timely response in
writing of their intention to remove the personal property from the premises
and does not do so within the landlord's notice or a mutually agreeable date
(whichever is later), it shall be conclusively presumed that the tenant has
abandoned such property.
      4.   Rent and Renewals.
         a.   If the landlord accepts rent, including holding payment, knowing
that it alleges a lease violation, including a default in the payment of rent
by the tenant, the landlord waives the right to terminate the rental agreement
for that breach.
         b.   If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord may maintain
a claim for possession or for rent and a separate claim for damages for breach
of the rental agreement.
         c.   No tenant shall be required to renew a rental agreement more than
90 days prior to the termination date of the rental agreement. If the landlord
violates this subsection, the tenant shall recover one month's rent or actual
damages, whichever is greater.
         d.   The landlord shall notify the tenant in writing at least 90 days
prior to the stated termination date of the rental agreement of the landlord's
intent to terminate the tenancy or not renew an existing rental agreement. If
the landlord fails to give required written notice, the tenant may remain in

agreement. You shall receive additional notice if there is change in owner."
         e.   If the owner or landlord fails to comply with this section, the

      7.   Security Deposits.
         a.   A landlord may not demand or receive security in an amount in
excess of one and one-half months' rent. A landlord may not avoid the coverage
of this subsection by labeling the fee as something other than a security
deposit, including "move-in" fee.
         b.   A tenant shall pay the landlord, at the time the tenant moves
into the premises or at any other time mutually agreed upon by the parties, the
amount of the security required by the landlord. Any portion in excess of one
month's rent, at the election of the tenant, shall be paid either at the time
the tenant pays the initial security deposit, or shall be paid in no more than
six (6) equal installments no later than six (6) months after the effective
date of the lease.
         c.   A landlord shall hold all security deposits in a federally
insured interest-bearing account in a bank, savings and loan association or

successors in interest, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in
bankruptcy.
         d.   Notwithstanding this section, a landlord may accept the payment
of the first month's rent and security deposit in one check or one electronic

account if, within seven (7) business days of acceptance of the check or
electronic funds transfer, the landlord transfers the amount of the security
deposit into a separate account that complies with this section.
         e.   The name and address of the financial institution where the
security deposit will be deposited shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed
in the written rental agreement signed by the tenant.

deposit is transferred from one financial institution to another, the landlord
shall, within fourteen (14) days of such transfer, notify the tenant in writing
of the name and address of the new financial institution.
         g.   Any landlord who receives a security deposit from a tenant shall
give a receipt indicating the amount of such security deposit, the name of the
person receiving it and, in the case of the agent, the name of the landlord for
whom such a security deposit is received, the date on which it is received, and
a description of the dwelling unit. The receipt shall be signed by the person
receiving the security deposit. Failure to comply with this subsection shall
entitle the tenant to immediate return of security deposit.
         h.   Upon payment of the security deposit by means of an electronic
funds transfer, the landlord shall give the tenant a receipt that complies with
this section or an electronic receipt that complies with this section, or an
electronic receipt that acknowledges the receipt of the security deposit, a
description of the dwelling unit and an electronic or digital signature of the
person receiving the deposit.
         i.   Upon termination of the tenancy, property or money held by the
landlord as a security deposit must be returned to the tenant within twenty-one
(21) days after the tenant has vacated the dwelling unit provided that the
landlord or successor landlord may deduct from the security deposit for the
following:
            (1)   Any unpaid rent which has not been validly withheld or
deducted pursuant to state or federal law;
            (2)   Any reasonable amount necessary to repair any damage caused
to the premises by the tenant or any person under the tenant's control or on
the premises with the tenant's consent, reasonable wear and tear excluded. In
the case of such damage, the landlord shall deliver or mail to the last known
address of the tenant within thirty (30) days an itemized statement of the
damages allegedly caused to the premises and the estimated or actual cost for
repairing or replacing each item on that statement, attaching copies of the
paid receipts for the repair or replacement. If estimated cost is given, the
landlord shall furnish the tenant with copies of paid receipts or a
certification of actual costs of repairs of damage if the work was performed by
the landlord's employees within 30 days from the date the statement showing
estimated costs was furnished to the tenant.
         j.   In the event of a sale, lease, transfer of ownership or control
or other direct or indirect disposition of residential real property by a
landlord who has received a security deposit from a tenant, the successor
landlord of such property shall be liable to that tenant for any security
deposit which has been paid to the transferor.
         k.   The transferor shall remain jointly and severably liable with the
successor landlord to the tenant for such security deposit unless and until
such transferor transfers said security deposit to the successor landlord and
provides notice, in writing, to the tenant of such transfer, specifying the
name, business address and business telephone of the successor landlord or
their agent within ten (10) days of said transfer.
         l.   The successor landlord shall, within fourteen (14) days from the
date of such transfer, notify the tenant, in writing, that any security deposit
was transferred to the successor landlord and that the successor landlord is
holding said security deposit. Such notice shall also contain the name,
business address and business telephone number of the successor landlord or
their agent.
         m.   If the landlord fails to comply with any provision of this
section, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to two (2)
times the security deposit and reasonable attorney fees. This section does not
preclude the landlord or tenant from recovering other damages which they may be
entitled under this chapter.
      5.   Retaliatory Conduct.
         a.   Except as provided for in this section, a landlord may not
retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or
threatening to bring action for possession or by refusing to renew a rental
agreement because the tenant has in good faith:
            (1)   Complained of code violations to a governmental agency,
elected representative or public official charged with responsibility for
enforcement of a building, housing, health, or similar code;    
            (2)   Complained of a building, housing, health or similar code
violation or an illegal landlord practice to a community organization or the
news media;
            (3)   Sought the assistance of a community organization, including
a legal aid organization, or the news media to remedy a code violation or
illegal landlord practice;
            (4)   Requested the landlord make repairs to the premises as
required by a building code, health ordinance, other regulation or the
residential rental agreement;
            (5)   Organized or becomes a member of a tenant union or similar
organization;
            (6)   Testified in any court or administrative proceeding
concerning the condition of the premises;
            (7)   Exercised any right or remedy provided by law.
         b.   If the landlord acts in violation of this section, the tenant has
cause of action against the landlord and/or a defense in any retaliatory action
against them and is entitled to the following remedies:
         c.   The tenant shall recover possession or terminate the rental
agreement and, in either case, recover an amount equal to not more than two (2)
months' rent or twice the damage sustained by the tenant, whichever shall be
greater, and reasonable attorney fees.
         d.   If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return
all security deposits recoverable under this chapter.
         e.   In an action by or against the tenant, if there is evidence of a
complaint within one year prior to the alleged act of retaliation, it may be
presumed that the landlord's conduct is retaliatory. The presumption shall not
arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of a proposed rent
increase.
         f.   A landlord's behavior shall not be considered retaliatory if any
code violation was caused primarily by the lack of care of the tenant, a member
of the tenant's family or other person on the premises with the tenant's
consent.
      9.   Anti-Lockout Provision.
         a.   It is unlawful for any landlord or any person acting at his
direction knowingly to oust or dispossess or threaten or attempt to oust or
dispossess any tenant from a dwelling unit without authority of law, by
plugging, changing, adding or removing any lock or latching device; or by
blocking any entrance into said unit; or by removing any door or window from
said unit; or by interfering with the services to said unit; including but not
limited to electricity, gas, hot or cold water, plumbing, heat or telephone
service; or by removing a tenant's personal property from said unit; or by the
removal or incapacitating of appliances or fixtures, except for the purpose of
making necessary repairs; or by the use or threat of force, violence or injury
to a tenant's person or property; or by any act rendering a dwelling unit or
any part thereof or any personal property located therein inaccessible or
uninhabitable. The foregoing shall not apply where:
            (1)   A landlord acts in compliance with the laws of Illinois
pertaining to forcible entry and detainer and engages the sheriff of Cook
County to forcibly evict a tenant or his personal property; or
            (2)   A landlord interferes temporarily with possession only as
necessary to make needed repairs or inspection and only as provided by law; or
            (3)   The tenant has abandoned the dwelling unit.
         b.   Removal of personal property when a landlord is acting in
compliance with the laws of Illinois pertaining to distress for rent (735 ILCS
5/9-301 et seq.) will not be considered a violation of this section. (Ord. O-

11-2-3: Preliminary Plan
11-2-4: Final Plat
11-2-5: Improvements Required; Guarantees
11-2-6: Recording Plats
11-2-1: PLAT APPROVAL REQUIRED:
Wherever any subdivision of land shall be laid out within the incorporated
limits of the City or within the contiguous unincorporated territory not more
than one and one-half (11/2) miles beyond the incorporated boundaries of the
City, the subdivider thereof or his agent shall submit both a preliminary and a
final subdivision plat to the City for its approval. The subdivision plats and
all procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in full compliance
with these regulations.
Until preliminary plats and plans for the subdivision are approved:
   A.   No land shall be subdivided nor any street laid out nor any
improvements made to the natural land.
   B.   No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be offered
for sale nor shall any sale or contract for sale be made or given.
   C.   No improvements, such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water drainage,
sanitary sewerage facilities, gas service, electric service, lighting, grading,
paving or surfacing of streets, shall be made by any owner or owners or his or
their agent or by any public service corporation at the request of such owner
or owners or his or their agent. (1976 Code §25-1-4)
   D.   No plat will be approved for a subdivision which is subject to periodic
flooding or which contains poor drainage facilities and which would make
adequate drainage of the lots and streets impossible. However, if the
subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, make the area safe for occupancy and provide adequate lot and street
drainage, the subdivision may then be approved. (For flood limits refer to
current edition Floodway, Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, City of Northlake,
Illinois, Cook County, Community-Panel Number 170134 0001, as published by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 1 ) (1976 Code §25-1-4; 1992 Code)

national flood insurance program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic
flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare;
and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic
and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following
specific purposes:
   A.   To meet the requirements of 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/18g,
rivers, lakes and streams act;
   B.   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   C.   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood
damage;
   D.   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   E.   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   F.   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance
program;
   G.   To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood
insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
   H.   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   I.   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitats,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development. (Ord. O-20-2008, 6-16-2008)

   A.   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
   B.   Where this chapter and other chapters, easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
   C.   This chapter is intended to repeal prior chapters or resolutions which
were adopted to meet the national flood insurance program regulations, but is
not intended to repeal the resolution which the city passed in order to
establish initial eligibility for the program. (Ord. O-20-2008, 6-16-2008)
12-1-4: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A structure which is on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use
of the principal structure.
ACT: "An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of
the state of Illinois", 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and
will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are
as specified in subsection
12-1-7-2C of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
12-1-6 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BUILDING: A structure that is principally aboveground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured
home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more
than one hundred eighty (180) days, unless fully licensed and ready for highway
use.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom

vegetation, debris or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA
will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries
or floodways as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or flood
insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and approved.

through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any public or private facility which, if flooded, would
create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life
and health. Examples are public buildings, emergency operations and
communication centers, etc.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/
OWR, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year frequency flood
discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the loss of
flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%) increase in
velocities.
   A.   The floodways are designated for Addison Creek on the flood insurance
rate map prepared by FEMA on map number 17031C panels 0366, 0367, and 0369 and
dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps
as may be prepared from time to time. When two (2) floodway maps exist for a
waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
   B.   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city that may be annexed into
the city are designated for Addison Creek on the flood insurance rate map
prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to
such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   C.   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated
floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located
on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation
is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:
   A.   Construction, reconstruction, repair or placement of a building or any
addition to a building.
   B.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a

zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V30, VE, V, M, E, or D.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
STRUCTURE: The results of a manmade change to the land constructed on or below
the ground, including the construction, reconstruction or placement of a
building or any addition to a building; installing a manufactured home on a
site; preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a travel trailer
on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days unless they are fully
licensed and ready for highway use.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred, regardless of the actual repair work performed. Volunteer
labor and materials must be included in this determination. Damage of less than
fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value will be applied to the repetitive
loss calculations.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT:
   A.   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement.
   B.   For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.
   C.   The term does not, however, include either: 1) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions, or 2) any alteration of a "historic structure" listed
on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure.
TRANSITION SECTION: Reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a
narrow cross section to a wide cross section or vice versa.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance is presumed to be in violation until such time
as that documentation is provided. (Ord. O-20-2008, 6-16-2008)

structures which must comply with subsection
12-1-8E1 of this chapter.
   B.   Methods For Fulfilling Duties: The city shall be responsible for
fulfilling all of the duties listed in subsection A of this section.
      1.   To fulfill those duties, the city first should use the criteria
listed in section
12-1-6, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain.
      2.   Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the city must determine whether the development site is within a
flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or floodplain for which
no floodway has been identified.
         a.   If the site is within a flood fringe, the city shall require that
the minimum requirements of section
12-1-7-1 of this chapter be met.
         b.   If the site is within a floodway, the city shall require that the
minimum requirements of section
12-1-7-2 of this chapter be met.
         c.   If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the city shall require that the
minimum requirements of section
12-1-7-3 of this chapter be met.
      3.   In addition, the general requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
12-1-7-1,
12-1-7-2, or
12-1-7-3 of this chapter.
      4.   The city shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the
requirements of section

complete all notification requirements.
      6.   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required
in this chapter, the city may take any and all actions as outlined in section
12-1-12 of this chapter. (Ord. O-20-2008, 6-16-2008)
12-1-6: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for
the city. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is
not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available in the Illinois state water
survey's floodplain information repository that has been approved by IDNR/OWR
and FEMA. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she shall
finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for approval prior to any
development of the site.
   A.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
Addison Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
flood insurance study of the city prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008,
and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to
time.
   B.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook
County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or
revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   C.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the city. The base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an
"A zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the city shall be according to the
best existing data available in the Illinois state water survey floodplain
information repository.
      1.   When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be
determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-RAS, HEC-2, or WSP-2.
      2.   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, or TR-20, or by techniques
presented in various publications prepared by the United States geological
survey for estimating peak flood discharges.
      3.   Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above
analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval. Once approved it must be
submitted to the Illinois state water survey floodplain information repository
for filing.
      4.   For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the
historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed
engineering study and approved by IDNR/OWR for drainage areas greater than one
square mile.
      5.   For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1
square mile) which has been identified by the city pursuant to subsection
12-1-5A1c of this chapter, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the
applicant utilizing a method as approved in this subsection C, with concurrence
of the city. (Ord. O-20-2008, 6-16-2008)
12-1-7: OCCUPATION AND USE REGULATIONS IN SPECIFIC AREAS:
12-1-7-1: FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
   A.   General Requirements: Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe
will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood by proper elevation and compensatory storage, and other
applicable provisions of this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely
affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located
within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section along with
the requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter.
   B.   Development Permit:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the city.
      2.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the city.
         a.   The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations in MSL, 1929 adjustment datum or NGVD and all changes
in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of
all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the
elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade
shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to
the requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter.
         b.   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas
shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of
grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to
be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
         c.   The city shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant
copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or permit not
required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The city shall
not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been
obtained.
      3.   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the city shall
compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation.
         a.   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter. The city shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map identification.
   C.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      1.   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data
and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of
removing the site from the floodplain.
   D.   Compensatory Storage:
      1.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
      2.   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
      3.   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
      4.   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
      5.   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly
to the watercourse.
   E.   Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE):
A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a
site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate
the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the city to construct the
lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The
city shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all
the criteria set forth in the following subsection:
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection D of this
section.
         a.   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
         b.   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above
the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of
the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement
cannot be met, the city may waive the ten foot (10') minimum setback if an
Illinois registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method
to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met.
The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural
design analysis, which shall be submitted to the city for review. The city may
require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed
shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case
shall the setback distance be less than four feet (4').
         c.   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained,
the city may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback distance if an
Illinois registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method
to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures has been met.
A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback
distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be
submitted to the city for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less
than four feet (4').
         d.   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under
the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree of permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML
according to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering
purposes.
         e.   The fill material must be homogeneous (i.e., all of 1 material)
and isotropic (i.e., having the same engineering properties) and in the same
direction.
         f.   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois registered professional engineer, as warranted by the
site conditions.
         g.   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five feet (5') below the BFE.
         h.   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab,
and minimum of one-fourth (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4)
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
         i.   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
         j.   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand
hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
         k.   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in subsections E1a through E1j of this section, the city may allow the
construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates
that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set
forth in FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding.
In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from
flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the
proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be
completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA technical bulletin 10-
01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois registered
professional engineer.
         l.   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural
grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation,
if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. O-20-2008, 6-
16-2008)
12-1-7-2: DESIGNATED FLOODWAYS:
   A.   Scope: This section applies to proposed development, redevelopment,

      3.   Review Of Application: A registered professional engineer, under the
employ or contract of the city, shall review and approve applications reviewed
under this section.
   C.   Preventing Increased Damages: The only development in a floodway which
will be allowed are appropriate uses which will not cause a rise in the base
flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity, or be a threat to public health and
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 will be allowed.
Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new
structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
      1.   Public flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works
or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding of
existing structures, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and
wildlife.
      2.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access
to, the water or shoreline, such as instream aeration and similar treatment
facilities, facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, and
commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses.
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls.
      4.   Underground and overhead utilities.
      5.   Public open space and recreational facilities such as playing fields
and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when
viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows,
and including open air pavilions.
      6.   Bridges, culverts and associated roadways, sidewalks and railways
necessary for crossing over the floodway or for providing access to other
appropriate uses in the floodway and any modification thereto.
      7.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure.
      8.   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or
repairs made to a building that are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and which
do not increase the outside dimensions of the building.
   D.   Construction Of Appropriate Uses: Within the designated floodway as
identified on the floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an
appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed
project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so
stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered
professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection
requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter:
      1.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance So As Not To Increase Flood Stages
Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on
stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project, will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         a.   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n"
is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See "Open
Channel Hydraulics", Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.)
         b.   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
         c.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of
effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
            (1)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
            (2)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
            (3)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction,
a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of
stream length shall be used.
            (4)   Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineations on adjacent properties.
            (5)   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      2.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume
of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a
reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All
designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All designated
floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the
compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. There shall be no reduction
in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such
modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
      3.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts
or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in
the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. In the case of bridges
or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water
in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the
structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use
of riprap or other design measures.
      4.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches: The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event, or the
upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
         a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
12-1-6 of this chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA
hydraulic chart for the selection of highway culverts. Bridges must be analyzed
using the U.S. DOT/federal highway administration hydraulics of bridge
waterways calculation procedures.
         b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection D2
of this section.
         c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection D3 of this
section.
         d.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
         e.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing conditions and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by
subsection C of this section.
         f.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per this subsection D.
      5.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And
Approach Roads:
         a.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         b.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         c.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a
source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance
with 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 (floodway construction in
northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
      6.   On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any
increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 feet, when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. A
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures, as
defined in section
12-1-4 of this chapter, shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois
administrative code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
         a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation or regional storm water detention;
         b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish
species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle,
such as for spawning;
         c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin;
         d.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
         e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
      7.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures:
         a.   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no farther than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building.
         b.   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required
for floodproofing activities.
      8.   Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for
lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency:
         a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
         b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
         c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used.
         d.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      9.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
         a.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would
accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body
of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization,
floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a
stream side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish
and wildlife habitat.
         b.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values.
         c.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
            (1)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
            (2)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
            (3)   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
            (4)   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
            (5)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or riprap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete,
gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
            (6)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
            (7)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established
where appropriate.
            (8)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
            (9)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
            (10)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
            (11)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
         d.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
      10.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      11.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to the
initiation of improvements.
         b.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to
denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion
of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at
final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
         c.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
         d.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in
width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels (see subsection D9 of this section). Construction vehicle use of
channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed,
where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along
channels shall be restabilized immediately.
         e.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed
and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban Soil
Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green
Book", and the "Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
      12.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR, through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations, that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      13.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
         a.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in section
12-1-6 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
         b.   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the designated floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         c.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      14.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision:
         a.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated
floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant
shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents
necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and
receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
         b.   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
         c.   In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
         d.   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
         e.   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
      15.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall
be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
      16.   Construction Within Twenty Five Feet Of The Channel: For all
activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25')
of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
         a.   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         b.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and
issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as
necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or
structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed
in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of
map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon
acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.
   E.   Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State Review:
For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the following
criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence and/or
permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or county delegated
state permitting authority in the floodway.
      1.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection D5 of this section.
      2.   An engineer's determination that a proposed bridge affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening.
      3.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage
pursuant to subsections D1, D2 and D8 of this section.
      4.   The construction of any IDNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in
section
12-1-4 of this chapter) and all other state, federal, or local units of
government projects, including projects of the municipality or county.
      5.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge
pursuant to subsection D4 of this section.
      6.   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood
profiles.
      7.   Projects in public bodies of water.
   F.   Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/5 et seq. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated
this responsibility to the city.
   G.   Permits For Dams:
      1.   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
"dam", as defined in section
12-1-4 of this chapter, per 17 Illinois administrative code part 3702 (rules
for construction of dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam.
      2.   If the city finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the
city shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office.
      3.   If the city finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition,
the city shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett
office, and the Illinois emergency management agency (IEMA).
   H.   Activities That Do Not Require A Registered Professional Engineer's
Review: The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
      1.   Underground and overhead utilities that:
         a.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or
         b.   Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the
floodway, or
         c.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe
or encasement is buried a minimum of five feet (5') below the existing
streambed, and
         d.   Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above the estimated
100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of an
existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting towers
shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so as to not catch
debris.
         e.   Disturbance of streamside vegetation shall be kept to a minimum
during construction to prevent erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed
floodway areas, including the stream banks shall be resorted to their original
contours and seeded or otherwise stabilized upon completion of construction.
         f.   A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water
pollution as defined by the environmental protection act 415 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5 (1992 state bar edition) shall be provided with shutoff valves on
each side of the body of water to be crossed.

         a.   That does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length.
         b.   Where materials are not placed higher than the existing top of
bank.
         c.   Where materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross
sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake.
         d.   Where stabilization utilizing native vegetation and gradual side
slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems.
Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use
of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete,
construction rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
      5.   Temporary stream crossings in which:
         a.   The approach roads will be one-half foot (1/2') or less above
natural grade.
         b.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert.
         c.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two
feet (2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.

unnumbered A zones) where no floodways have been identified and no base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and
draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the
cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the
flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
   B.   Development Permit:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by
state law, shall commence any development in an SFHA or floodplain without
first obtaining a development permit from the city.
      2.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the city.

copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or permit-not-
required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The city shall
not issue the development permit unless all required federal, state, and local
permits have been obtained.
   C.   Determining Elevation: Based on the best available existing data,
according to the Illinois state water survey's floodplain information
repository, the city shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
      1.   Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's
engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection
12-1-6C of this chapter.
      2.   Any development located on land that can be shown to have been
higher than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map
identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the
requirements of this chapter.
      3.   The city shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
identification.
   D.   Preventing Increased Damages:
      1.   No development in the SFHA where a floodway has not been determined
shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or
velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural
hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair
existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be
minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter.
   E.   Standards: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been
determined, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   Engineering Requirements: The developer shall have a registered
professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans,
calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of
subsections
12-1-7-2D1 through D12 of this chapter, for the entire floodplain as calculated
under the provisions of subsection
12-1-6C of this chapter.
         a.   As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study
performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to IDNR/OWR
for acceptance as a designated floodway.
         b.   Upon acceptance of the floodway by IDNR/OWR, the developer shall
then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section
12-1-7-2 of this chapter for the designated floodway. The floodway shall be
defined according to the definition in section
12-1-4 of this chapter.
      2.   IDNR/OWR Permit Required: A development permit shall not be issued
unless the applicant first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written
documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR.
      3.   When IDNR/OWR Permit Not Required: No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be
required if IDNR/OWR has delegated permit responsibility to the city per 17
Illinois administrative code part 3708 for designated floodways.
      4.   Permits For Dams:
         a.   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
"dam" as defined in section
12-1-4 of this chapter per 17 Illinois administrative code part 3702 (rules for
construction of dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam.
         b.   If the city finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit,
the city shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office.
         c.   If the city finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe
condition, the city shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR
Bartlett office, and the Illinois emergency management agency (IEMA).
      5.   Activities Potentially Permitted Without Engineer's Review: The
following activities may be permitted without a registered professional
engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and designated
floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this
chapter:

do not extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to
the flow of floodwaters.
         h.   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
            (1)   The affected length of stream is less than one thousand feet
(1,000').
            (2)   The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural
stream channels, or
            (3)   The cross sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to

general problem; and
      9.   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved including existing stream uses.
   C.   The city shall notify an applicant, in writing, that a variance from
the requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.
   D.   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site
or "historic structure", as defined in section

this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. O-
20-2008, 6-16-2008)
12-1-12: PENALTIES:
   A.   Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a
variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due
investigation, the city may determine that a violation of the minimum standards
of this chapter exists. The city shall notify the owner in writing of such
violation.
   B.   If such owner fails, after ten (10) days' notice, to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city may make application to the circuit court for an injunction
requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court

on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   C.   The city shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a
wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a
standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      1.   The city is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, shall
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      2.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state: a) the grounds for complaint
or reasons for suspension or revocation; and b) the time and place of the
hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board
of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.

12-2-1: AUTHORITY:
This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to cities and
villages by the Illinois Revised Statutes chapter 24, sections 11-12-5, 11-12-
6, 11-12-12, 11-13-1, 11-14-1, 11-30-2, 11-30-8, 11-105-1, 11-109-1 and 11-110-
11 and chapter 85, section 1711 and P.A.'s 85-905 and 1266. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-
10-90)
12-2-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Chapter is to diminish threats to public health, safety and
welfare caused by runoff of excessive storm water from new development and
redevelopment. This excessive storm water could result in the inundation of
damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels
and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources. The cause of increases
in storm water runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the
development and improvement of land, and as such, this Chapter regulates these
activities to prevent adverse impacts.
This Chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
   A.   To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood
hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   B.   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood
damage due to increased storm water runoff;
   C.   To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding
on a watershed basis;
   D.   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood-control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel
erosion problems and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased
storm water runoff quantities from new development;
   E.   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources;
   F.   To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and flood plains and to protect water quality and aquatic
habitats;
   G.   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to
moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)

12-2-6: MINIMIZATION OF INCREASES IN RUNOFF VOLUMES AND RATES:
In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall
evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features which minimize
the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's
drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which
are consistent with the following hierarchy:

12-2-7: WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES:
The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse water quality
impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall
incorporate design features to capture storm water runoff pollutants. Retention
and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout the property's
drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and to reduce the
quantity of runoff pollutants. The drainage system should incorporate multiple
uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible with storm water management
include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails,
playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should
avoid using portions of the property exclusively for storm water management.
(Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)
12-2-8: DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS AND METHODS:
   A.   Release Rates: The drainage system for a property shall be designed to
control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 2-year, 24-hour
and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in
flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with
other developed properties and and downstream drainage capacities. The peak
discharge from events less than or equal to the 2-year event shall not be
greater than four one-hundredths (0.04) cfs per acre of property drained. The
peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than fifteen one-hundredths (0.15)
cfs per acre of property drained.
   B.   Detention Basins Generally:
      1.   Outlet Design:
         a.   Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage
system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet.
         b.   Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to
control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of four inches (4"). If
this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those specified in
this Section, and regional detention is not a practical alternative,
alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate self-cleaning
flow restrictors.
      2.   Detention Storage Requirements: The design maximum storage to be
provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year,
24-hour event and reservoir (also called modified puls or level pool) routing
or equal. Detention storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as
described in this Section.
      3.   Wet Detention Basin Design:
         a.   Purpose: Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove storm
water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and, as much as
feasible, to be available for recreational use.
         b.   Depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet (3') deep,
excluding nearshore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided,
they shall be at least ten feet (10') deep over twenty five percent (25%) of
the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out.
         c.   Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal
pool elevation shall not be steeper than five to one (5:1) (horizontal to
vertical).
         d.   Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin
at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the
2-year event.
         e.   Inlet and Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the
distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible,
they should be at opposite ends of the basin.
      4.   Dry Detention Basin Design:
         a.   Purpose: In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter,
dry basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants, to be safe, to
be aesthetically pleasing and, as much as feasible, to be available for
multiple uses.
         b.   Drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that eighty percent
(80%) of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than seventy two
(72) hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Underdrains
directed to the outlet control shall be used if necessary to accomplish this
requirement.
         c.   Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.
         d.   Inlet and Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the
distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible,
they should be at opposite ends of the basin.
   C.   Drainage System Design and Evaluation: The following criteria should be
used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective
is to provide capacity to pass the 10- year peak flow in the minor drainage
system and an overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity.
      1.   Design Methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas
up to ten (10) acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational
formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites.
Runoff hydrograph methods, as described in subsection D of this Section, must
be used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than ten
(10) acres of drainage area and for the design of all detention basins.
      2.   Positive Drainage: Whenever practicable, all areas of the property
must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a
stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity
of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the
minor drainage system capacity shall be provided. Drainage easements, street
ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch
(1").
   D.   Methods for Generating Runoff Hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs shall be
developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and
antecedent moisture:
      1.   Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system
hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois
State Water Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall
distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems
with critical durations less than or equal to twelve (12) hours. The third
quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis
of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than
twelve (12) hours and less than or equal to twenty four (24) hours. The fourth
quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with
durations greater than twenty four (24) hours. The first, third and fourth
quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of Bulletin
70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff
distributions.
      2.   Antecedent Moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not
rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume
a conservative wet antecedent moisture condition as a minimum.
   E.   Detention in Floodplains: The placement of detention basins within the
floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable
operation during flood events. However, the storm water detention requirements
of this Chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood
fringe areas on the project site, provided the following provisions are met:
      1.   Detention in Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for one and one-half
(1.5) times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention
basin, including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided
shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this Section. The
applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and flood plain
backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses
shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All flood
plain storage lost below the 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below
the 10-year flood elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the existing
10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10- year flood
elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse.
      2.   Detention in Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with subsection E3 of this Section.
      3.   On-Stream Detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this Chapter with respect to water quality and control of the 2-
year and 100- year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are
presented in Section 12-2-9 of this Chapter. If on-stream detention is used for
watersheds larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant
use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for
any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the
stream as part of on-stream detention:
         a.   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species which
require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
         b.   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality
or stream aquatic habitat;
         c.   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin;
         d.   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands;
         e.   Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source
management program throughout the upstream watershed;
         f.   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and
         g.   Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code Parts 702 and
708 and the Flood Plain Ordinance of the City. 3
   F.   Drainage into Wetlands: Wetlands shall be protected from damaging
modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter,
the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage
flows into wetlands:
      1.   Detention in Wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for
the purposes of storm water detention unless it is demonstrated that the
existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will maintain
or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing
depressional storage in wetlands shall be maintained, and the volume of
detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this Section shall be in
addition to this existing storage.
      2.   Sediment Control: The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and
shall not be filled.
      3.   Alteration of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be
altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
the wetland.
      4.   Detention/Sedimentation Basin: All runoff from the development shall
be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to
capture the 2-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least twenty four (24)
hours before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed
before property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in
Section 12-2-6 of this Chapter should be followed to minimize runoff volumes
and rates being discharged to the wetland.
      5.   Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet
(25') in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be
maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland.
   G.   Street, Parking Lot and Culvert Drainage:
      1.   Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major
drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one
inch (1") and shall not remain flooded for more than eight (8) hours for any
event less than or equal to the 100-year event.
      2.   Parking Lots: The maximum storm water ponding depth in any parking
area shall not exceed six inches (6") for more than four (4) hours.
      3.   Culvert Road and Driveway Crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings
shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the
culvert.
   H.   Infiltration Practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes,
infiltration practices, including basins, trenches and porous pavement, should
be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups "A" or "B" as designated by the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to
recharge ground water shall not be located within seventy five feet (75') of a
water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be
provided to remove coarse sediment from storm water flows before they reach
infiltration basins or trenches. Storm water shall not be allowed to stand more
than seventy two (72) hours over eighty percent (80%) of a dry basin's bottom
area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of
infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet (4') above seasonably
high ground water and bedrock.
   I.   Safety Considerations:
      1.   Generally: The drainage system components, especially all detention
basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults
coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
      2.   Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100- year
capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the
basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention
basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1)
(horizontal to vertical).
      3.   Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety
ledge at least four feet (4') in width, two and one-half to three feet (2.5' -
3') below the normal water depth.
      4.   Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow.
      5.   Overflow Structures: All storm water detention basins shall be
provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a
stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity
of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate.
   J.   Maintenance Consideration: The storm water drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes shall be
designed to allow lawnmowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins
shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain
the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by
gravity is not feasible.) Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where
feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy
equipment shall be provided. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)
12-2-9: ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS:
   A.   Generally: Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the property
shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage system. Whenever
practicable, flows from upstream areas that are not to be detained should be
routed around the basin being provided for the site being developed.
   B.   Upstream Areas Not Meeting Requirements of this Chapter:
      1.   When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of
this Chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on
the applicant's property shall be explored by the applicant. The following
steps shall be followed:
         a.   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his
property using the release rates of Section 12-2-7 of this Chapter, the
applicant's property area and the procedures described in Section 12-2-8 of
this Chapter.
         b.   Areas tributary to the applicant's property not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this Chapter shall be identified.
         c.   Using the areas determined in subsection B1b above plus the
applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined properties
shall be computed.
      2.   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined
property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in Section 12-2-8 of
this Chapter. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully
developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the purpose
of computing storage.
      3.   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the City may choose
to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the
regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage
for his property as computed in subsection B1a above. If regional storage is
selected by the City, then the design produced in subsection B1c above shall be
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the City, the applicant shall
bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever
practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin and
the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the applicant must meet the
provisions of subsection 12-2-8E3 of this Chapter for on-stream basins.
   C.   Upstream Areas Meeting Requirements of this Chapter: When there are
areas which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this Chapter,
tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed
around the applicant's detention basin or be routed through the applicant's
detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for
the applicant's property shall still be computed as described in subsection B1a
of this Section. However, if the City decides to route tributary area flows
through an applicant's basin, the final design storm water releases shall be
based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas.
It must be shown that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's
property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property alone. (Ord. 0-
61-90, 11-10-90)
12-2-10: EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES:
Where detention, retention or depressional storage areas are to be used as part
of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first
element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these
facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order
to maintain the design volume of the facilities. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)
12-2-11: FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION:
All single-family residential developments under five (5) acres in size and all
other development under one acre in size shall pay a fee of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.00) for each acre-foot of detention which would be required
under this Chapter rather than installing detention facilities on the property,
unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the Director of Health and
Inspectional Services. In instances where regional benefits and economies of
scale can be achieved, it will be permissible for adjacent properties to
utilize a common regional detention basin. Applicants shall have the option of
paying a fee of their proportional cost of construction of detention required
so that the City can build regional facilities, or they can jointly build the
necessary facilities themselves. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90; 1992 Code)
12-2-12: MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY:
Maintenance of storm water drainage facilities located on private property
shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before a storm water
detention permit is obtained from the City, the applicant shall execute a
maintenance agreement with the City guaranteeing that the applicant and all
future owners of the property will maintain its storm water drainage system.
The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of
the City to enter onto the property for the purpose of inspections and
maintenance of the drainage system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the
Recorder of Deeds of Cook County. The maintenance agreement shall include a
schedule for regulate maintenance of each aspect of the property's storm water
drainage system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by
authorized personnel of the City. The maintenance agreement shall also
stipulate that if the Director of Health and Inspectional Services of the City
or his authorized representative notifies the property owner, in writing, of
maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall make
such corrections within thirty (30) calendar days of such notification. If the
corrections are not made within this time period, the City may have the
necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner.
The City has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner
for maintenance of the storm water drainage system. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)
12-2-13: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Inspections During Construction: General site grading shall not begin
until the Director of Health and Inspectional Services has certified, in
writing, to the applicant that any necessary detention facilities are in place
and operational. The Director of Health and Inspectional Services or his
representative will also conduct periodic inspections of the work in progress
to be certain that the drainage system is being built as designed. If any
violations of the provisions or requirements of this Chapter are noted during
such inspections, the Director of Health and Inspectional Services shall notify
the property owner, in writing, of the items needing correction. The property
owner shall have ten (10) calendar days to make such corrections unless given a
specific extension of time, in writing, by the Director of Health and
Inspectional Services. Failure to complete such corrections within the
specified time period shall constitute a violation of this Chapter.
   B.   Final Inspection: Upon notification by the applicant that the drainage
system is completed, the Director of Health and Inspectional Services or his
representative shall conduct a final inspection. If the drainage system is
found to contain deficiencies which require correction, the Director of Health
and Inspectional Services or his representative shall notify the property owner
of the necessary corrections. The property owner shall correct such
deficiencies within ten (10) calendar days unless given a specific extension of
time, in writing, by the Director of Health and Inspectional Services. Failure
to make necessary corrections within the specified time period shall constitute
a violation of this Chapter.
Upon finding that the drainage system meets the provisions and requirements of
this Chapter the Director of Health and Inspectional Services shall issue, in
writing, a notice of drainage system completion to the property owner.
   C.   Routine Inspections: All privately owned drainage systems shall be
inspected by representatives of the City not less often than once per year. A
written report shall be filed of the results of any inspection and a copy sent
to the property owner detailing any problems which need correction. (Ord. 0-61-
90, 11-10-90)
12-2-14: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
The administration and enforcement of this Chapter shall be the responsibility
of the Director of Health and Inspectional Services of the City or his
representatives. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)
12-2-15:APPEALS:
All appeals to the Director of Health and Inspectional Services decisions
regarding the interpretation of this Chapter shall be heard by the City
Council. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90; 1992 Code)
12-2-16: PENALTIES:
Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions or requirements of this
Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day the violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. (Ord. 0-61-90, 11-10-90)
