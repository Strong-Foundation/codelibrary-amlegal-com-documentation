Illinois; providing for the repeal of certain ordinances not included therein;
providing a penalty for the violation thereof; providing for the manner of
amending such code; and providing when such code and this ordinance shall
become effective.
   Whereas, the mayor, with the approval of the city council, has caused a new
code to be published in typewritten form;
   Whereas, the new code updates and clarifies various ordinances lawfully
passed by the Virginia city council in years past and also eliminates
inconsistent and archaic ordinances, or parts of ordinances, not applicable to
the existing conditions of the city;
   Whereas, it has been determined the new code will better protect individual
rights of due process by these clarifications;
   THEREFORE, be it ordained by the city council of the city of Virginia,
Illinois, as follows:

Sterling Codifiers, consisting of titles 1 through 11, each inclusive, is
adopted.

before March 9, 2009, and not included in the code or recognized and continued

construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a
subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance.
   Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person
convicted of a violation of any provision of the code or any ordinance, rule or
regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine
not exceeding $750.00. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such
violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided
by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to
the amendment of any code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in
the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city
may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and
revocation of licenses or permits.
   Section 5. Additions or amendments to the code when passed in such form as
to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part of the
code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the code, so that reference to the
code includes the additions and amendments.
   Section 6. Ordinances adopted after March 9, 2009, that amend or refer to
ordinances that have been codified in the code shall be construed as if they
amend or refer to like provisions of the code.

conditions:
         a.   The member must notify the Clerk at least twenty four (24) hours
before the meeting, unless impractical (such as in the case of the sudden onset
of an illness or an emergency), so that necessary communications equipment can

deemed authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion
objecting to the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded, and approved

ORDINANCES
SECTION:
1-13-1: Introduction And Passage
1-13-2: Publication
1-13-3: Effective Date
1-13-4: Passage Over Mayor's Veto
1-13-1: INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE:
   A.   No ordinance shall be passed by the city council at the same meeting -
whether it be a regular or special meeting - at which the same was introduced.
If any ordinance shall be amended at any meeting subsequent to its
introduction, the same shall not be passed at the meeting at which the same was
amended. Provided, however:
      1.   In the case of an emergency or urgency in the passage of the
ordinance, which said emergency and/ or urgency shall be expressed in the
preamble or body of the ordinance in a section reciting the existence of an
emergency or urgency, an ordinance may be passed at the meeting in which it was
introduced. The emergency section shall be passed upon and shall be adopted by
a two-thirds (2/3-rds) vote of all the alderman elected, including the mayor.
The vote to pass such emergency clause shall be taken by yeas and nays and
entered upon the journal. The ordinance containing the emergency clause may
then be passed, by a majority vote (unless a greater vote is required by
ordinance or statute), at the meeting at which it was introduced. If the vote
to pass the emergency clause does not receive the required two-thirds (2/3-rds)
votes, then it shall fail, and the ordinance may be considered in the ordinary
course of voting, upon two readings; and
      2.   Ordinances providing for local improvements may be finally passed at
the same meeting of the city council at which they were presented.
   B.   The passage of all ordinances, for whatever purpose, require the
concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the city
council, including the mayor, unless otherwise expressly provided by statute.
The passage of an ordinance to sell any school property shall require the
concurrence of three-fourths (3/4) of all aldermen then holding office. The
yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of the designated
ordinances and recorded in the journal of the city council. In addition, the
city council at any meeting may, by unanimous consent, take a single vote by
yeas and nays on the several questions of the passage of any two (2) or more of
the designated ordinances placed together for voting purposes in a single
group. The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal under the
designation "omnibus vote", and in that event, the clerk may enter the words
"omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal in each case instead of
entering the names of the members of city council voting "yea" and those voting
"nay" on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, included in the
omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of a single or omnibus vote and the
entries of the words "omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal shall be
a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this subsection to all intents
and purposes and with like effect as if the vote in each case had been taken
separately by yeas and nays on the question of the passage of each ordinance
included in the omnibus group and separately recorded in the journal. (1925

see that the same is correctly printed and published. Provided, however,
nothing in this subsection contained shall be deemed to apply to any ordinance
included in any revision or compilation of ordinances which may be collectively
published in book or pamphlet form by authority of the city council. (1925 Code
§ 13-4; amd. 2009 Code)
   B.   The clerk shall, at the foot of the record of each ordinance recorded
as aforesaid, make a memorandum of the date of the passage and of the
publication of such ordinance, which record and memorandum, or a certified copy
thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of the passage and legal publication of
such ordinance for all purposes whatsoever. (1925 Code § 13-5)
1-13-3: EFFECTIVE DATE:
All ordinances of the city required to be published shall take effect ten (10)
days after the passage and due publication thereof, and all other ordinances,
resolutions and orders shall take effect from and after their passage unless
otherwise provided therein. (1925 Code § 13-6)
1-13-4: PASSAGE OVER MAYOR'S VETO:
In case the mayor shall veto any ordinance or part of any ordinance and return
the same to the council, together with his objections thereto, the vote by
which the same was passed shall be reconsidered by the council; and if, after
such consideration, two-thirds (2/3) of all the members elected to the city
council shall agree by yeas and nays to pass the same, it shall go into effect
notwithstanding the mayor's refusal to approve it. The vote on the question of
passage over the mayor's veto shall be recorded in the journal. (1925 Code §

SEXUAL HARASSMENT 1
SECTION:
1-19-1: Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-19-2: Definition Of Sexual Harassment
1-19-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-19-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-19-5: Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-19-6: Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
 
Notes
  1. This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights
1 Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act
  100-0554.
1-19-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Virginia to prohibit harassment of
any person by any Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or
Municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All Municipal
officials, Municipal agents, Municipal employees and Municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 2017-6, 1-8-2018)
1-19-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   A.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment,
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      1.   Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      2.   Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person". (Ord. 2017-6, 1-8-2018)
1-19-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   A.   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
Director of Human Resources, an Ethics Officer, the Public Works Director, or
the Mayor of the City.
   B.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      1.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all Municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the Municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 2017-6, 1-8-2018)
1-19-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or Municipal
agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any Municipal
employee due to a Municipal employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy,
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   B.   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a Municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act 1  provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2 , an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other
proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation 3 .
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4 , it is a civil rights
violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate
against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in
good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge - due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 2017-6, 1-8-2018)

1-19-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an Ethics Commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a State or Federal agency. (Ord. 2017-6, 1-8-2018)
1-19-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an Ethics Commission, an Inspector General, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 2017-6, 1-8-2018)

applicant. The owner and the person installing the building sewer for said
owner shall indemnify the authority from any loss or damage that may directly
or indirectly be occasioned by said installation. (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4-5: EXTENSIONS OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   A.   The authority shall be responsible for determining whether or not an
extension of a public sewer is economically feasible based on the estimated
cost of the extension and the number of existing potential users that will use
said sewer line. If the extension is economically feasible, then the authority
may install and pay the cost of the extension at the discretion of the
authority. If the authority elects not to pay the cost of extending the public
sewer, then the person or persons desiring sewer service shall install the
extension at their own personal expense upon written consent of the authority.
The authority shall not pay for any extensions to an undeveloped area, such as
a subdivision being developed, unless there are sufficient existing residents
or businesses to make the extension economically feasible.

extensions. Before any extensions are installed, the plans and specifications
must be reviewed and approved by the state environmental protection agency, the
state department of transportation, and the county highway department, as
applicable, for extensions of sewers along or across highways within their
respective jurisdictions.
   C.   Ownership, right of way and title must be conveyed to the authority for
all extensions installed by anyone other than the authority. The authority
shall maintain the extended public sewers thereafter.
   D.   No extension of the public sewer shall be permitted if, in the opinion
of the authority, the system does not have the necessary capacity to serve the
proposed extension. (Ord., 10-21-1978)

his expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the authority to
determine that such facilities are being operated in conformance with
applicable federal, state and local laws and permits. The owner shall maintain
operating records and submit to the authority a monthly summary report of the
character of the influent and effluent to verify performance facilities against
authority monitoring records.
      2.   Pretreatment of industrial wastes from major contributing industries
prior to discharge to the treatment works is required and is subject to the
rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. environmental protection agency and
published in the federal register on November 8, 1973, (38 CFR 3-982), federal
guidelines dated October 1973, any more stringent requirements established by
the authority, and any subsequent federal guidelines and rules and regulations.
      3.   Industrial cooling water, which may be polluted with insoluble oils
or grease or suspended solids, shall be pretreated for removal of pollutants,
and the resultant clear water shall be discharged in accordance with subsection
3-4-6-1C of this section
3-4-6.
   B.   Maintenance Required: Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense. (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4-6-4: CONTROL MANHOLE:
The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial
waste or other nonresidential wastewater may be required by the authority to
install a control manhole or other suitable structure, together with such
necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building, to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurements of the wastes. Such structures, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in
accordance with plans approved by the authority. The structures shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to
be safe and accessible at all times. (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4-6-5: MEASUREMENTS, TESTS, ANALYSES AND INSPECTIONS:
   A.   The authority may require users of the treatment works, other than
residential users, to supply pertinent information on wastewater flow
characteristics. Such measurements, tests and analyses shall be made at the
user's expense.
   B.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the authority or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type and frequency of
laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the
authority, but no less than once per year, the industry must supply a complete
analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that
compliance with the federal, state and local standards are being met. The owner
shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the
authority. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and
reporting required by the authority. At such times as deemed necessary, the
authority reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by
an outside laboratory service. Appropriate charges for sampling and analysis
may be assessed to the user at the option of the authority. The results of
routine sampling and analysis by the user may also be used for determination of
charges, after verification by the authority.
   C.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The Examination Of
Water And Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole or other suitable structure
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples).
   D.   Agents of the authority shall be permitted to enter all properties for
the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing of
wastewater discharges and discharge facilities. (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4-6-6: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:

3-4A-1: BASIS FOR WASTEWATER CHARGES:
The wastewater charge for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater
facilities of the authority shall consist of a basic user rate for operation
and maintenance, a minimum user charge and a surcharge, if applicable.
   A.   Minimum User Charge: The minimum user charge shall not be less than
that computed by dividing the annual costs of authority's administrative
expenses and budgeted fixed costs, including depreciation, by the total number
of users. Through further division (divide total by 12 months), the monthly
minimum required user charge can be computed.
   B.   Basic User Rate:
      1.   The basic user rate shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter (250 mg/l).
      2.   The basic user rate shall consist of operation and maintenance
costs, replacement, depreciation, bond indebtedness or improvements and shall
be not less than that computed as follows:
         a.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities for all works categories.
         b.   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories
by volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible.
         c.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated.
         d.   Proportion the estimated costs to nonindustrial and industrial
users by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
         e.   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage
strength.
         f.   Compute surcharge costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons per
milligram per liter in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   C.   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed
the normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge
will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters
for all wastes which exceed the two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) and
two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) concentration for BOD and SS,
respectively. Subsection 3-4A-4B of this section specifies the procedure to
compute a surcharge.
   D.   Review Of Charges: The adequacy of the wastewater charges shall be
reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the authority in its
annual audit report. The wastewater charges shall be revised periodically to
reflect any changes in debt service costs, in operation and maintenance costs
including replacement costs, or in administrative and reserve costs. (Ord., 10-
21-1978)
3-4A-2: MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
   A.   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
one hundred (100) gallons.
   B.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part or all of his water from sources other than the public waterworks system,
all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the
authority for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
these other sources.
   C.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by
the authority if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
   D.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed unless service is canceled without
the consent of the authority. (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4A-3: RATES ESTABLISHED:
   A.   Minimum Charge; Basic User Rate: There shall be and there is hereby
established a minimum user charge and a basic user rate for the use of and for
service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city. A minimum user
charge and a basic user rate as set out in subsection
3-5-1B of this title shall be applied to all users. (Ord., 4-4-1982; amd. 2009
Code)
   B.   Surcharge Rate: The rates of surcharges for BOD and SS shall be as
follows:
      1.   For BOD, a surcharge rate of $0.003 per milligram per liter per one
thousand (1,000) gallons shall be applied for waste strength in excess of two
hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
      2.   For SS, a surcharge rate of $0.0024 per milligram per liter per one
thousand (1,000) gallons shall be applied for waste strength in excess of two
hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l). (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4A-4: COMPUTATION OF RATES:
   A.   Wastewater Charge: The wastewater charge shall be computed by the
following formula:
 
W = M + (Vu x UR) UR + S
Where:   
 W    = Amount of wastewater charge ($) per billing period
 M    = Minimum user charge for budgeted fixed costs (subsection 3-4A-3A of
         this article)
 Vu   = Wastewater volume for the billing period
         Basic user rate for budgeted proportional costs, such as operation,
 UR   = maintenance, replacement and depreciation (subsection 3-4A-3A of this
         article)
 S    = Amount of surcharge (subsection 3-4A-3B of this article and subsection
         B of this section)
 
(Ord., 10-21-1978)
   B.   Surcharge: The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges
shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as
often as may be deemed necessary by the city and shall be binding as a basis
for surcharges. The surcharge shall be the sum computed as follows: (Ord., 10-
21-1978; amd. 2009 Code)
      1.   For BOD, multiply the surcharge rate by the strength of the waste in
excess of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l), and further multiply
this product by the total flow discharge per one thousand (1,000) gallons; plus
      2.   For SS, multiply the surcharge rate by the strength of the waste in
excess of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l), and further
multiply this product by the total flow discharged per one thousand (1,000)
gallons. (Ord., 10-21-1978)
3-4A-5: INDUSTRIAL WASTE COST RECOVERY:
No industrial user may discharge sewage into any public sewer until the city
has adopted an industrial cost recovery system which:
   A.   Meets the requirements of section 204(b)(1)(B) of the federal water
pollution control act amendments of 1972 and applicable federal regulations;
and
   B.   Has been approved by the agency in accordance with the conditions of

CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances).

(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, the city of Virginia shall notify adjacent communities in writing
thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 10-04, 6-14-2010)
4-3-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board of appeals
for a variance. The zoning board of appeals shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the city council
of Virginia. The city council of Virginia may attach such conditions to
granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this
chapter.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   The zoning officer shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance
from the requirements of the building protections standards of section
4-3-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
4-3-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
4-3-6 and
4-3-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 10-04, 6-14-2010)
4-3-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Virginia or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 10-04, 6-14-2010)
4-3-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Virginia city attorney
may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists.
The Virginia city attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of Virginia shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order
as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of Virginia shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.
   B.   The city attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The city attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning board of appeals
shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Virginia from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 10-04, 6-14-
2010)
4-3-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of
Virginia to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program.
However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance
adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements, covenants or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 10-04, 6-14-2010)
4-3-15: APPLICATION FEE:
In addition to any and all other applicable fees which may be required by this
code or by law, all applicants for variances and zoning changes shall pay a
nonrefundable application fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) at the
time of making application to help defer part of the costs incurred by the city
in considering the application. No request for variance or zoning change shall
be considered unless the foregoing fee is paid. (Ord. 14-07, 8-11-2014)

      1.   A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence, in the judgment
of the zoning board, sustains each of the following:
         a.   That the plight of the owner was not created by the owner and is
due to unique circumstances.
         b.   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality. (Ord., 4-1-1973; amd. 2009 Code)
      2.   For the purpose of implementing the above standards, the zoning
board, in making its decision whenever there are practical difficulties or
particular hardships, shall also take into consideration the extent to which
the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the
evidence that:
         a.   The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship
upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the regulations
were strictly enforced.
         b.   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification.
         c.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property, or any person through whom
the applicant claims title.
         d.   The granting of the variation will not be substantially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
         e.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
   B.   Conditions Of Variations: The zoning board may require such conditions
and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary
to comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize
the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood,
and to implement the general purpose and intent of this title. (Ord., 4-1-1973)

bearing strength, erosion susceptibility, or any other feature likely to be
harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of
the city. The planning commission, in applying the provisions of this section,

be increased through additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating
capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking
or loading facilities, as required herein, shall be provided for such increases
in intensity of use.

zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are
accessory. No such off street parking facilities shall be authorized and no
building permit shall be issued where the plans call for parking facilities
other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the board of zoning appeals
has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made findings that the
common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and site of the parking
facilities are reasonably certain to continue, and that the off site parking
facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the proposed use

CHAPTER 15
CONDITIONAL USES; PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION:
6-15-1: Categories Of Conditional Uses
6-15-2: Planned Development Procedure
6-15-3: Conditional Uses
6-15-1: CATEGORIES OF CONDITIONAL USES:
"Conditional uses", as defined in section
6-2-2 of this title, are those which cannot be adequately controlled by simple
preregulation through rigid dimensional and use standards. Conditional uses are
those which require individual review by the planning commission to ensure
conformance with the intent of all comprehensive plan elements. Conditional
uses include two (2) basic categories:
   A.   Planned Development Projects: Complex projects designed to take maximum
advantage of unique site characteristics and potentials along with original
design and use concepts and submitted for review under the planned development
procedure.
   B.   Single Uses: Single uses or single aspects of permitted uses
specifically identified in this title as requiring individual review under the
conditional use procedure. (Ord., 4-1-1973)
6-15-2: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE:
   A.   Intent: The planned development procedure is intended to provide a
single uniform procedure for total review of a proposed development, both
design and use. The procedure combines the design review procedure of
subdivision approval and the use review procedure of zoning amendments, and
enables the planning commission and the city council to review all aspects of a
proposed development simultaneously to permit greater flexibility and
originality in concept according to the intent of comprehensive plan elements
and still to exercise greater final control over the approved development than
is possible through a preregulation zoning district. (Ord., 4-1-1973)
   B.   Standards:
      1.   Design Standards: Because the design standards for use, dimensions,
density and qualitative attributes are subject to evolution through continuous
plan review, they are not included as an integral part of the unchanging
planned development procedure. This title refers to the officially adopted
policies, detailed area plans, and all other elements of the evolving
comprehensive plan for the standards to guide the approval of planned
development projects. However, a planned development project shall conform with
all applicable elements of an officially adopted comprehensive plan. (Ord., 4-
1-1973; amd. 1981 Code)
      2.   Required Improvements: Planned development projects shall be subject
to the regulations governing required improvements found in the subdivision
regulations ordinance.
      3.   Parking, Loading, Traffic And Access: Planned development projects
shall be subject to the regulations for parking, loading, traffic and access of
this title.
      4.   Special Conditions: The planning commission and city council may
attach special conditions to approve of the final plats to ensure conformance
with the intent of all official plan elements.
   C.   Procedure:
      1.   Zoning Map Amendment Required: A planned development project may be
permitted only by amendment to the zoning map according to the amendment
procedure found in section
6-3-5 of this title. For procedural purposes, a planned development project
shall be treated as a subdivision and the procedure for subdivision approval,
as set forth in the subdivision regulations ordinance, shall be followed in its
entirety whether the development shall be in a single or divided ownership.
      2.   Preliminary Plat: A preliminary plat of the planned development
project shall be submitted as required by the subdivision regulations
ordinance. It is recommended that this submission be preceded by preapplication
conferences to determine whether the developer's intent agrees with the intent
expressed by all comprehensive plan elements. Additional supporting material
beyond that required by the subdivision regulations ordinance for the
preliminary plat shall include:
         a.   Explanation of the character of the planned development and the
manner in which it has been planned to take advantage of the flexibility of
these regulations.
         b.   Statement of present and proposed ownership of all land within
the project.
         c.   Development schedule indicating:
            (1)   Stages in which the project will be built with emphasis on
area, density, use and public facilities such as open space to be developed
with each stage. Overall design of each stage shall be shown on the plat and
through supporting graphic material.
            (2)   Approximate dates for beginning and completion of each stage.
         d.   Agreements, provisions or covenants which will govern the use,
maintenance and continued protection of the planned development and any of its
common open space.
      3.   Amendment Procedure: The amendment procedure established in section
6-3-5 of this title shall be initiated after conditional approval of the
preliminary plat by the planning commission. Under this procedure, the zoning
district map may be amended to designate the location proposed in the
preliminary plat as a planned development district superseding the original or
existing zoning district. This amendment shall be in conformance with all
comprehensive plan elements. The planned development district shall be valid
only for that preliminary plat and supporting material upon which the amendment
was based. All supporting material shall remain on file with the preliminary
plat.
      4.   Final Plats: If the amendment is approved, final plats shall be
prepared for each stage according to the development schedule. The final plat
and supporting material shall show in detail the design and use of all
buildings and overall land development plans, as well as such other information
the planning commission may require for the complete consideration of the
project in addition to information required by the subdivision regulations
ordinance. The final plats shall conform to the preliminary plat and supporting
material; except, that the planning commission and city council may approve
minor changes without public hearing at this time which do not change the
concept or intent of the development. Major changes (changes in density, height
of buildings, reduction of proposed open space, changes in the financing,
development schedule or final governing agreements, provisions or covenants, or
resubdivision) may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plat or
applicable supporting material followed by the amendment procedure.
      5.   Continuing Control: The planned development project shall be
developed only according to the approved and recorded final plat and all
supporting material. The recorded final plat and supporting material, together
with all recorded amendments, shall be binding on the applicants, their
successors and assigns and shall limit and control the uses of premises and
location of structures in the planned development project. Major changes in the
final submission of a new preliminary plat during or after construction shall
be accomplished by submission of a new preliminary plat followed by the
amendment procedure. The city council shall consider the planned development
amendment subject to revocation if construction falls more than one year behind
schedule. (Ord., 4-1-1973)
      6.   Fees And Permits: The city council may establish a schedule of
reasonable fees to be charged for plat review. Building permits shall be
required for each structure according to chapter 3 of this title. The zoning
enforcement officer shall base issuance upon conformance with the final plat
and supporting material. (Ord., 4-1-1973; amd. 2009 Code)
6-15-3: CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Conditional Uses In All Districts: The following are designated as
conditional uses which may be approved in all zoning districts:
Public utility and service uses such as electric substations, gas regulator
stations, telephone transmission structures, radio, TV and microwave relay
towers, water reservoirs, pumping stations, sanitary landfills, government
buildings, transportation facilities, planned developments and similar uses.
   B.   Conditional Uses In Specified Districts: Other conditional uses may be
approved in only those zoning districts where they are designated as
conditional uses under the zoning district regulations. (Ord., 4-1-1973)
   C.   Procedure:
      1.   In applying for a conditional use, the applicant shall follow all
procedures set forth for building permits. (Ord., 4-1-1973; amd. 2009 Code)
      2.   The zoning enforcement officer shall refer the application to the
planning commission.
      3.   The planning commission shall, after careful review of the
application for conditional use, make a recommendation on each application to
the city council. The planning commission, after holding a public hearing in
accordance with state statutes, shall make a recommendation after the concluded
public hearing, forwarding such recommendation directly to the city council.
      4.   The city council may approve, modify or disapprove the application.
In the case of approval or approval with modification, the city council shall
issue written authorization to the zoning enforcement officer to issue a
conditional use permit in full conformance with this chapter. This
authorization shall remain on permanent file with the application.
      5.   The city council may attach special conditions to ensure conformance
with the intent of all comprehensive plan elements.
      6.   The city council may establish a schedule of reasonable fees to be
charged for a conditional use permit.
      7.   The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may be modified by other provisions of this title, or by the city
council.
   D.   Standards Granting Conditional Use:
      1.   No conditional use permit shall be recommended by the city council
or the planning commission unless there is a concurring vote of the majority of
all members present which must, at minimum, comprise a quorum.
      2.   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
      3.   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already permitted,
nor substantially diminish property values within the neighborhood.
      4.   The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      5.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage or necessary facilities
have been or will be provided.
      6.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.

excess of the recommended displacement values that will reach the level of
damage potential. Based upon U.S. bureau of mines data, damage potential can be
determined by measurement of "peak particle velocity". Particle velocity is the
speed at which the individual earth particles are moving (or vibrating) as the
earth wave passes a particular location.
   B.   Measurements shall be made at or beyond the adjacent line or the
nearest residence district boundary line. Vibration displacements shall be
measured with an instrument or complement of instruments capable of
simultaneously measuring in three (3) mutually perpendicular directions.
   C.   The maximum permitted displacements shall be the particle velocity of
two inches (2") per second. The peak (maximum) particle velocity can be
determined from displacement and frequency by the mathematical expression two
(2) pi times frequency times displacement. (Ord., 4-1-1973)
6-16-3: SMOKE AND PARTICULATE MATTER:
   A.   Nuisance Declared: The emission of smoke or particulate matter in such

not be permitted in any industrial district.
   B.   Measurement Of Smoke And Particulate Matter: For the purpose of grading
the density or equivalent opacity of smoke, the Ringelmann chart described in
the U.S. bureau of mines information circular 6888 shall be employed. The
emission of smoke or particulate matter of a density or equivalent opacity
greater than no. 1 on the Ringelmann chart is prohibited at all times except as
otherwise provided hereinafter.
   C.   General Requirements:
      1.   Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such
sources as storage areas, yards, roads and the like, within lot boundaries,
shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, fencing,
wetting or other acceptable means.
      2.   The open burning of refuse, paint, oil, debris and any other
combustible material is prohibited in all industrial districts.
      3.   No operation shall result in the emission into the open air from any
process or control equipment, or in the measurement at any convenient measuring
point in a breeching or stack of particulate matter in the gases that exceeds
0.60 pound per thousand pounds of gases during any one hour.
      4.   Particulate matter loadings in pounds per acre described below shall
be determined by selecting a continuous four (4) hour period which will result
in the highest average emission rate.
   D.   M-1 District Standards:
      1.   The emission of smoke having a density or equivalent opacity in
excess of Ringelmann no. 1 is prohibited. However, for two (2) minutes in any
four (4) hour period, smoke up to and including Ringelmann no. 2 shall be
permitted.
      2.   The rate of emission of particulate matter from all stacks and vents
within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed 0.2 pound per acre of lot
area during any one hour.
   E.   M-2 District Standards:
      1.   The emission of smoke having a density or equivalent opacity in
excess of Ringelmann no. 2 is prohibited. However, for two (2) minutes in any
four (4) hour period, smoke up to and including Ringelmann no. 3 shall be
permitted.
      2.   The rate of emission of particulate matter from all stacks and vents
within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed one pound per acre of lot
area during any one hour. (Ord., 4-1-1973)
6-16-4: TOXIC MATTER:
The following apply to the M-1 and M-2 districts:
   A.   The release of airborne toxic matter (including radioactive matter)
shall not exceed one-thirtieth (1/30) of the maximum permissible concentration
allowed an industrial district when measured at any point beyond the lot line,
either at ground level or habitable elevation, whichever is more restrictive.
Concentrations shall be measured and calculated at the highest average that
will occur over a continuous twenty four (24) hour period.
   B.   If a toxic substance is not contained in the most recent listing of
threshold limit values published by the American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists, the applicant shall satisfy the environmental protection
agency that the proposed levels will be safe to the general population. (Ord.,
4-1-1973)
6-16-5: ODORS:
   A.   General Requirements: The release of materials capable of becoming
odorous, either by bacterial decomposition or chemical reaction, shall meet the
