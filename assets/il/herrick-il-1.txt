§ 32.01  POLICY.
   It is the policy of the village to invest public funds in a manner which
will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while
meeting the daily cash flow demands of the entity and conforming to all state
and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.02  SCOPE.
   This investment policy applies to the investment of available assets of all
village funds under the direct management of the Village Treasurer.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.03  PRUDENCE.
   (A)   Investments shall be made with judgement and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the
probable income to be derived.
   (B)   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be
the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of managing
an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written
procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.04  OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   Funds of the village will be invested in accordance with the Illinois
Compiled Statutes, these policies, and written administrative procedures.
   (B)   The primary objective, in order of priority, shall be:
      (1)   Legality. The village’s investments will be in compliance with all
federal, state, and other legal requirements;
      (2)   Safety. Investments of the village will be taken in a manner that
seeks to ensure the preservation of capital and protection of investment
principal;
      (3)   Liquidity. The village’s investments will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the village to meet all operating requirements that might be
reasonably anticipated; and
      (4)   Yield. The village’s investments will be designed with the
objective of attaining market rates of return.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.05  DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   Management and administrative responsibility for the investment program is
hereby delegated to the Village Treasurer who, under the delegation of the
Village Board, shall establish written procedures for the operation of the
investment program.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.06  ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and
management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to
make impartial decisions.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.07  AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL DEALERS AND INSTITUTIONS.
   (A)   The Village Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services.
   (B)   In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved security
brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.08  AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS.
   (A)   Investments may be made in any type of security allowed in state
statutes regarding the investment of public funds. Among the authorized
investments are:
      (1)   Non-negotiable certificates of deposit and other collateralized
evidence of deposits with qualified public depositories;
      (2)   Obligations of the United States government, its agencies and
instrumentalities. However, this authorization shall specifically exclude
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), Real Estate Mortgage Investment
Conduits (REMICs), and other Principal Only (POs) and Interest Only (IOs)
obligations that are secured with mortgages issued by any federal agency,
instrumentality, or private firm;
      (3)   Public Treasurers’ Investment Pool established by § 17 of the State
Treasurer Act, 15 ILCS 505/17; and
      (4)   Any investments authorized by the Public Funds Investment Act (30
ILCS 235.01 et seq.).
   (B)   Investments are to be made that reflect the cash flow needs of the
fund type being invested.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.09  COLLATERALIZATION.
   (A)   Funds on deposit (checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and the
like) in excess of FDIC limits must be secured. So as to anticipate market
changes and provide an adequate level of security for all funds, the
collateralization level will be 110% of market value of principal. Acceptable
collateral is limited to obligations of the United States government, its
agencies, and instrumentalities.
   (B)   Collateral will always be held by an independent third party
institution in the name of the village. A clearly marked evidence of ownership
(safekeeping receipt) must be supplied and retained.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.10  SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
   (A)   All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase
agreements, entered into by the village shall be conducted on a delivery-
versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by an independent third
party custodian designated by the Village Treasurer and evidenced by
safekeeping receipts and a written custodial agreement.
   (B)   Investment officials shall be bonded to protect the village against
loss due to possible embezzlement and malfeasance.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.11  DIVERSIFICATION.
   The village shall diversify its investments to the best of its ability based
on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of those funds.
Diversification can be by type of investment, number of institutions invested
in, and length of maturity.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.12  MAXIMUM MATURITIES.
   (A)   To the extent possible, the village shall attempt to match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a
specific cash flow, the village will not directly invest in securities maturing
more than three years from the date of purchase.
   (B)   Reserve funds may be invested in securities not to exceed five years.
The maturity of such investments are made to coincide as nearly as practicable
with the expected use of the funds.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.13  INTERNAL CONTROLS.
   (A)   The Village Treasurer is responsible for establishing and maintaining
an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the entity
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. The internal control structure shall
be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met.
   (B)   The internal controls shall address the following points:
      (1)   Control or collusion;
      (2)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting;
      (3)   Custodial safekeeping; and
      (4)   Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and
wire transfers.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.14  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   This investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the
parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a
comparable rate of return during a market/economic environment of stable
interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared to benchmarks with
similar maturity, liquidity, and credit quality of the portfolio.
   (B)   MARKET YIELD (BENCHMARK).  Current 90-day treasury bill rate.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.15  REPORTING.

market value, as of the report date.

§ 32.16  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   (A)   In the event any state or federal legislation or regulation should
further restrict instruments or institutions authorized by this policy, such
restrictions shall be deemed to be immediately incorporated in this policy.
   (B)   If new legislation or regulation should liberalize the permitted
instruments or institutions, such changes shall be available and included in
this policy only after written notification to the Village Board and its
subsequent approval of said changes.
(Ord. passed - -1999)
§ 32.17  INVESTMENT POLICY ADOPTION.

Village Board. The policy should be reviewed on an annual basis by the Village
Treasurer and any modifications made thereto must be approved by the Village

CROSS-CONNECTIONS
§ 50.50  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these rules and regulations is:
   (A)   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system;
   (B)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable water system and
non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or systems containing
substances of unknown or questionable safety; and
   (C)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer’s potable water systems.
(Ord. 158, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 50.51  APPLICATION.
   These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises served by the public
potable water supply system of the village.

§ 50.52  POLICY.
   The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for protection of the
public water supply system from contamination due to backflow or back-siphonage
of contaminants through the customer’s water service connection. If, in the
judgement of the Maintenance Supervisor or his or her authorized
representative, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the
safety of the public water supply system, the Maintenance Supervisor shall give
notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention device at
each service connection to the premises. The consumer shall immediately install
such approved device or devices at his or her own expense; failure, refusal, or
inability on the part of the consumer to install such device or devices
immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until such device or devices have been installed. The consumer shall
retain records of installation, maintenance, testing, and repair as required in
§
50.56(D)(4) below for a period of at least five years. The Maintenance
Supervisor may require the consumer to submit a cross-connection inspection

and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be deemed in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken, at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.)

company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end

the Retailers’ Occupations Tax Act, being 35 ILCS 120/2-27.

retailer.

taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a

taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this subchapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this subchapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this subchapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement the
Act.
(Ord. 221-2003, passed 8-5-2003)
§ 110.05  RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this subchapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided herein above in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.
