be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected, and
the word or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration
shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or
extent of the error.

of Trustees or a certain village officer or employee to make additional
regulations for the purpose of carrying out the intent of the ordinance, all
regulations of a similar nature serving that purpose effected prior to the
codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect and are

(1983 Code, § 1-1-4) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 10.98 PROCEDURE FOR SETTLING AND COMPROMISING ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS; INDEX OF
MINIMUM FINES.
   (A)   Notice of violation. All persons accused of violating or failing to
comply with any provision of the code of ordinances of the village or any other
ordinances of the village not reprinted within the loose-leaf volume entitled
“Code of Ordinances of the Village of Kirkland,” including but not limited to
ordinances relating to traffic control, shall be notified of the violation or
failure to comply in one of the following two ways:
      (1)   By arrest, or by the issuance of a formal complaint in the Circuit
Court of DeKalb County, which complaint shall require the appearance of the
defendant at the Circuit Court upon a noted day. All citations for moving
violations found in 625 ILCS 5/11 may require such an appearance. A violation
or a failure to comply commenced in this manner shall not be settled or
compromised, but shall proceed to a hearing at which the defendant may plead
“guilty” or “not guilty;” or
      (2)   By the issuance to the defendant of a “hang-on ticket.”
         (a)   A “hang-on ticket” may be issued for any ordinance found in the
village municipal code; however, “hang-on tickets” shall not be issued for
moving violations found in Chapter 11 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
         (b)   A violation or failure to comply commenced pursuant to the
issuance of a “hang-on ticket” may be settled or compromised as provided in
this section.
   (B)   Hang-on tickets.
      (1)   A person receiving a “hang-on ticket” may settle or compromise the
ticket by payment of the amount shown on the ticket or, if no amount is shown
on the ticket, then the amount of the minimum fine provided in this section for
the offense, at the Village Hall of the village within ten days after the
issuance of the ticket. If the ticket is not settled or compromised within the
initial ten-day period, it may be settled or compromised by the payment of
twice the amount of the ticket, or if no amount is shown on the ticket, then
twice the amount of the minimum fine provided in this section for the offense,
for a period of 20 days after the lapse of the initial ten-day period.
      (2)   In the case of failure to make payment as herein provided, the
officer issuing the ticket shall issue a written notice to appear and complaint
which shall state the name and address of the person, if known; the offense
committed; be signed by the officer; and request the person to appear at the
Circuit Court of DeKalb County at a specific time and date. The notice to
appear and complaint shall be served in the manner provided by the rules of the
Circuit Court of DeKalb County.
      (3)   In the event that the person fails to appear in court on the date
set forth in the notice to appear and complaint, the matter shall be referred
to the Circuit Court of DeKalb County for issuance of summons or an arrest
warrant and the setting of a date for a hearing.
      (4)   At any time during the initial ten-day period, the person issued
the citation can request that a court date be assigned in order to contest the
allegations. The failure to request a court hearing date shall constitute a
waiver of a person’s right to contest the allegations set forth in the “hang-on
ticket” as a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
   (C)   Payment of settlement. Payment of a settlement and compromise amount
shall be made to the village in person or by mail, and a receipt shall be
issued for all money so received.
   (D)   Prosecutions. Officers of the Village Police Department are hereby
authorized to refrain from initiating a prosecution for the alleged offense for
which “hang-on tickets” are issued until the expiration of 11 days from the
date of issuance of the ticket, as provided in this section.
   (E)   Index of minimum fines.
      (1)   This index in no way limits the right of the village to assess or
to seek a higher fine than is listed herein, or to impose or seek any other
remedy which is provided by ordinance or other law. The maximum penalty which
may be assessed in the event of any violation of the code of ordinances of the
village per offense is as set forth in §
10.99.
      (2)   The index in
Appendix A to this chapter is provided for reference purposes only. Failure to
include an existing or future minimum fine within this index in no way
invalidates the fine.
   (F)   Payment of fines.  
      (1)   Unless provided otherwise herein, all fines, forfeitures and
penalties, shall be paid on or before the tenth day after the receipt thereof,
to the proper officer collecting the same.
      (2)   Upon failure to comply with a final warning notice from the village
to pay the designated fine for a violation as described herein, the collection
of this debt shall be turned over to a collection agency, referred to the
Circuit Court of DeKalb County, or otherwise collected as prescribed by law.
The Chief of Police shall promulgate any necessary rules and regulations
regarding the implementation and administration of this practice.

receive payment; and report to the Board of Trustees all delinquent accounts.
      (2)   Any resident and water billing customer who wishes to seek a
reduction in their water bill for a single billing cycle, based upon
extraordinary circumstances which caused an inordinately high water bill, may
submit a written request to the Village Clerk for presentment at the next
regularly scheduled Village Board meeting for consideration. The Board may
consider the request and determine if the circumstances warrant a reduction in
the bill, with such circumstances to include, without limitation: the amount of
the water bill in relation to customary usage; the presented reason for the
higher bill; whether such reason was within the reasonable control of the
resident; whether such reason has been mitigated to prevent a reoccurrence and
how timely the mitigation was pursued; and any prior instance(s) of the
resident or another person in control of the same property seeking a reduction
in the water bill. Based upon a totality of the circumstances the Village Board
may, by motion, reduce the amount owed on the single water bill in an amount
deemed reasonable but in no event shall such reduction be less than the average
water bill based upon the 12 prior months’ usage and billing for the property
(or if there is not a 12 month history, as many months as are available).
Nothing in this provision shall be construed to be a right or guarantee that
any water bill will be reduced.

affiliate, an office, generation facility, distribution facility, transmission
facility, sales office or other place of business, or any employee, agent or
other representative operating within this state under the authority of the
person or its subsidiary or other affiliate, irrespective of whether the place
of business or agent or other representative is located in this state
permanently or temporarily, or whether the person, subsidiary or other
affiliate is licensed or qualified to do business in this state.

(Ord. 05-06, passed 6-6-2005)
§ 34.51 PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
the village to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official,
municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis
of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal
employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually
harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack
thereof.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment. This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently
defines SEXUAL HARASSMENT as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls," "smacking"
or "kissing" noises;
         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
         (e)   Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   If any Supervisory Personnel as described in this policy learns of
an incident of alleged harassment, it is that individual's responsibility to
immediately report the incident to the appropriate person and/or conduct an
investigation. An investigation of the allegations of all complaints will be
made as soon as practicable and, to the extent practicable and appropriate
under the circumstances, confidentiality will be maintained.
      (2)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment is encouraged to deal
with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating her/his position to the offending employee, in addition to
notifying Supervisory Personnel. In the event an employee is not comfortable or
feels threatened by the offending employee, the employee is encouraged to
report promptly to Supervisory Personnel. It is not necessary for sexual
harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      (3)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct.
      (4)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including:
         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem may be reported to Supervisory
Personnel. Supervisory Personnel includes a department head, the Village
President, Village Trustee(s), or the Village Attorney.
         (c)   Confidential communications. Employees may report to Supervisory
Personnel concerning any conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment. Any
reported allegations of harassment will be investigated promptly. Village
personnel will make a reasonable effort to maintain confidentiality, only
disclosing information on a need-to-know basis. However, absolute
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
      (5)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
      (6)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
      (7)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
      (8)   The village encourages prompt reporting of complaints so that rapid
response and appropriate action may be taken. Thus, all complaints should be
reported as soon as possible but within six months of the alleged harassment.
Delayed reporting of complaints will not, in and of itself, preclude the
village from taking remedial action.
   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations. 
      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it
is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which
he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge, due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, and/or collective
bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the Prohibition
on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of
up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the
municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to
local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a
separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate
and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or
penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, and/or collective
bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
state's attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

Editor’s note:  With the passage of Resolution 20-03 on March 2, 2020, the
village adopted a revised anti-harassment policy.
§ 34.52 RETIREMENT FUND PARTICIPATION; REQUIREMENT ADOPTION.
   (A)   The President and Board of Trustees elects to exclude from
participation in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund all officials and
employees in positions normally requiring performance of duty for less than
1,000 hours per year.
   (B)   This exclusion shall apply only to officials and employees who first
occupy offices or positions under the Fund after adoption of this section.
(Ord. 2017-02, passed 5-15-2017)
§ 34.53 TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT POLICY.
   Policy governing reimbursement of employee and officer travel, meal and
lodging expenses.
   (A)   Purpose. The Board of Trustees of the village will reimburse employee
and officer travel, meal, and lodging expenses incurred in connection with pre-
approved travel, meal, and lodging expenses incurred on behalf of the village.
Employees and officers are expected to exercise the same care in incurring
expenses for official business as a prudent person would in spending personal
funds.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning:
      ENTERTAINMENT. Includes, but is not limited to, shows, amusements,
theaters, circuses, sporting events, or any other place of public or private
entertainment or amusement, unless ancillary to the purpose of the program or
event.
      TRAVEL. Any expenditure directly incident to official travel by employees
and officers of the village or by wards or charges of the village involving
reimbursement to travelers or direct payment to private agencies providing
transportation or related services.
   (C)   Authorized types of official business. 
      (1)   Travel, meal and lodging expenses shall be reimbursed for employees
and officers of the village only for purposes of official business conducted on
behalf of the village, which includes but is not limited to off-site or out-of-
town meetings related to official business and pre-approved seminars,
conferences and other educational events related to the employee's or officer's
official duties. If you are unsure whether an expense is reimbursable, please
contact the Mayor to discuss the proposed travel.
      (2)   Employees and officers may be authorized to attend professional
conferences and meetings on work related topics. Employees shall submit
requests for conference or meeting attendance requiring overnight accomodations
to the Board of Trustees for approval. Approval for conferences is subject to
budgetary constraints and the Board's discretion. The Board may pre-approve
expenses for conferences and travel by including them in the annual budget and
appropriation ordinance.
   (D)   Categories of expenses.
      (1)   Airfare. Travelers are expected to obtain the lowest available
airfare that reasonably meets business travel needs. Travelers are encouraged
to book flights at least 30 days in advance to avoid premium airfare pricing.
Only coach or economy tickets will be paid or reimbursed. The traveler will pay
for the difference between higher priced tickets and coach or economy tickets
with his or her personal funds.
      (2)   Personal automobiles. Mileage reimbursement will be based on
mileage from the work location office to the off-site location of the official
business, not from the employee's or officer's residence. When attending a
training event or other off-site official business directly from an employee's
or officer's residence, no reimbursement will be made if the distance is less
than the mileage of a normal commute to the workplace. If the distance is
higher than the employee's or officer's normal commute, reimbursement will be
paid based on the differential of the commute less the mileage of a normal
commute to the workplace. An employee or officer will be reimbursed at the
prevailing IRS mileage rate. The traveler will only be reimbursed up to the
price of a coach airfare ticket if they drive to a location for which airfare
would have been less expensive.
      (3)   Automobile rentals. Travelers will be reimbursed for the cost of
renting an automobile including gasoline expense only as provided in this
section. Travelers using rental cars to conduct official business are required
to purchase insurance through the rental agency. Car rental insurance will
cover the vehicle during personal use, e.g., using the vehicle after the
conference has ended. Compact or mid- size cars are required for two or fewer
employees or officers traveling together and a full-size vehicle may be used
for three or more travelers. The traveler must refuel the vehicle before
returning it to the rental company.
      (4)   Public transportation. In the case of local training or official
business where an employee or officer chooses to use public transportation,
reimbursement for use of public transportation shall be the cost of the public
transportation plus any mileage in accordance with this policy.
      (5)   Other transportation. The traveler should utilize hotel shuttle
service or other shuttle services, if available. If none are offered, the use
of the most economic transportation is encouraged.
      (6)   Hotel/motel accommodations. The traveler will be reimbursed for a
standard single-room at locations convenient to the business activity. Hotel/
motel accommodations are to be reserved in advance and secured at a moderate or
conference rate. Reimbursement for lodging shall be limited to the number of
nights required to conduct the assigned village business. If a conference, for
example, opens on a Sunday evening and closes Thursday noon, reimbursement for
Sunday through Wednesday night would be allowed. In the event of a change in
plans or a cancellation, the traveler must cancel the hotel/motel reservation
so as not to incur cancellation charges. Cancellation charges will not be
reimbursed by the village unless approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees.
      (7)   Meals. Meal expenses and reimbursements are limited to the per diem
rate of $50. Receipts shall be submitted to substantiate all expenses within 14
days after expenses are incurred. Any amount of the per diem allowance which
was not spent by the traveler shall be returned to the township at the time
receipts are submitted. Meals provided by a conference or seminar should be
deducted from the per diem allowance. Partial reimbursement may be made for
departure and return days based on time. Meals during in-state travel that are
not part of an overnight stay will be reimbursed at the actual cost not to
exceed the GSA meal rate.
      (8)   Vacation in conjunction with business travel. In cases where
vacation time is added to a business trip, any cost variance in airfare, car
rental, lodging and/or any other expenses must be clearly identified on the
Travel, Meal, and Lodging Expense Report form and paid by the traveler.
      (9)   Accompanied travel. Family members may accompany the traveler when
traveling on official village business. However, no expenses attributable to
any family member will be reimbursable. All expenses will be calculated as if
the traveler were traveling alone, using the minimum costs to the village for
lodging, meals, and transportation.
      (10)   Parking. Parking fees at a hotel/motel or incidental to other
travel will be reimbursed only with a receipt.
      (11)   Entertainment expenses.  No employee or officer of the village
shall be reimbursed for any entertainment expense, unless ancillary to the
purpose of the program, event or other official business.
   (E)   Approval of expenses.
      (1)   Expenses for members of the Board of Trustees, officials or
employees. Travel, meal, and lodging expenses to be reimbursed to any member of
the Board of Trustees or any official or employee must be approved by roll-call
vote at an open meeting of the Village Board. Documentation of expenses must be
provided in accordance with divisions (C), (D) and (F) of this section. The
expenses may be included on the list of bills presented to the Board for
approval. Any excess from the per diem allowance must be repaid as provided in
this policy.
      (2)   Other expenses. All other expenses that do not fall within
divisions (E)(1) and (2) are subject to the Village Board's approval.
   (F)   Documentation of expenses. 
      (1)   Before an expense for travel, meals, or lodging may be approved
under division (E) of this section, the following minimum documentation must
first be submitted, in writing, to the Village Clerk on a Travel, Meal, and
Lodging Expense form:
         (a)   An estimate of the cost of travel, meals, or lodging if expenses
have not been incurred or a receipt of the cost of the travel, meals, or
lodging if the expenses have already been incurred;
         (b)   The name of the individual who received or is requesting the
travel, meal, or lodging expense;
         (c)   The job title or office of the individual who received or is
requesting the travel, meal, or lodging expense; and
         (d)   The date or dates and nature of the official business for which
the travel, meal, or lodging expense was or will be expended.
      (2)   All documents and information submitted under this section are
public records subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
   (G)   Travel, Meal, and Lodging Expense Report Form. The village hereby
adopts as its official standardized form for the submission of travel, meal,
and lodging expenses the Travel, Meal, and Lodging Expense Report form attached
to Ordinance 16-11 as Attachment 1 and incorporated herein.
   (H)   Maximum reimbursement. The maximum total amount the village will
reimburse a traveler for a single trip is $3,000. The maximum amount may be
increased because of emergency or other extraordinary circumstances when
approved by the Village Board at a roll call vote at a meeting.
(Ord. 16-11, passed 12-19-2016)
IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION POLICY
§ 34.60 BACKGROUND.
   Identity theft has become the number one consumer fraud issue in the
country. In 2007, more than 10,000 identity theft complaints were filed with
the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") by Illinois residents. The Village of
Kirkland ("village") recognizes that the risk to the village, its employees,
residents, and customers from data loss and identity theft is a significant
concern to the village, which this Identity Theft Prevention Program
("program") seeks to address.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.61 ADOPTION.
   The village developed the program in an effort to battle identity theft. The
program was developed with oversight and approval of the Village President and
Village Board. After consideration of the size and complexity of the village's
operations and customer account systems, and the nature and scope of the
village's activities, the Village President and Village Board determined that
this program was appropriate for the village, and therefore approved the
program on March 2, 2009.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.62 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The village adopts the program to help protect employees, customers,
contractors, and itself from harm and damage related to, or caused by, the loss
or misuse of sensitive information. The program also will assist the village in
detecting, preventing, and mitigating identity theft. The program does so by
identifying certain "red flags" that suggest or indicate the possibility of
identity theft, and by providing guidelines on how the village should respond
once it detects any such red flags. Further, the program will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the village in compliance with state and federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
   (B)   The program has been tailored to the size, complexity and the nature
of the village's operations. The program also has been designed in order to:
      (1)   Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those red flags into the program;
      (2)   Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
      (3)   Allow the village to respond appropriately to any red flags that
are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and
      (4)   Ensure that the program is reviewed periodically, and updated, if
necessary, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and
soundness of the village from identity theft.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.63 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   COVERED ACCOUNT.
      (1)   An account that the village offers or maintains, primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit
multiple payments or transactions, such as a utility account; and
      (2)   Any other account that the village offers or maintains for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and
soundness of the village, including financial, operational, compliance,
reputation, or litigation risks.
   CREDIT. The right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt
or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and
defer payment therefore.
   CREDITOR. Any person who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any
person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of
credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the
decision to extend, renew, or continue credit, including utility companies.
   CUSTOMER. A person that has a covered account with a creditor.
   IDENTITY THEFT. A fraud committed or attempted using identifying information
of another person without authority.
   PERSON. A natural person, a corporation, government or governmental
subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association.
   RED FLAG. A pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
   SENSITIVE INFORMATION. Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including, but not limited to, a person's credit card account information,
debit card information, bank account information, driver's license information,
Social Security number, mother's birth name, date of birth, electronic
identification number, computer Internet Protocol address, and routing code.
   SERVICE PROVIDER. A person that provides a service directly to the village.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.64 IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS.
   In order to identify relevant red flags, the village considers the types of
accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its
accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous
experiences with identity theft. The village identifies the following red
flags, in the following listed categories:
   (A)   Notifications and warnings from credit reporting agencies - red flags.
      (1)   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;

the village;
      (6)   Notice to the village that an account has unauthorized activity;
      (7)   Breach in the village's computer system security; and
      (8)   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   (E)   Alerts from others - red flags. Notice to the village from a customer,
identity theft victim, law enforcement or other person that it has opened or is
maintaining a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.65 DETECTING RED FLAGS.
   (A)   New covered accounts. In order to try and detect any of the red flags
identified in § 34.64 associated with the opening of a new covered account,
village personnel should take the following steps to obtain and verify the

(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.66 PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT.
   (A)   Securing sensitive information.
      (1)   Village personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing sensitive and confidential information. Furthermore, in exercising
such judgment, consideration should be given to the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act ("FOIA"). If an employee is uncertain of the sensitivity of a
particular piece of information, the employee should contact their supervisor
or the program administrator. Further, if the village receives a FOIA or other
request seeking sensitive information, or documents containing sensitive
information, said requests should be forwarded to the Village President and the
Village Attorney.
      (2)   In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft
occurring with respect to village accounts, the village shall make reasonable
efforts to take the following steps with respect to its internal operating
procedures to protect customer identifying information:
         (a)   Take steps to ensure that the village's website is secure or
provide clear notice that the website is not secure;
         (b)   Attempt to ensure destruction of paper documents and computer
files containing sensitive information;
         (c)   Keep file cabinets, desk drawers, cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information locked when not
in use;
         (d)   Lock storage rooms containing documents with sensitive
information and record retention area at the end of the work day or when
unsupervised;
         (e)   Attempt to ensure that office computers with access to covered
accounts and/or sensitive information are password protected and that computer
screens lock after a set period of time;
         (f)   Keep workstations, work areas, and offices clear of papers
containing sensitive information;
         (g)   Request only the last four digits of Social Security numbers (if
any);
         (h)   Attempt to ensure that computer virus protection is up to date;
         (i)   Require and keep only the kinds of sensitive information that
are necessary for the village's purposes; and
         (j)   Account statements and receipts for covered accounts shall only
include the last four digits of the credit card, debit card, or the bank
account used for payment of the covered account.
   (B)   Electronic distribution. Each employee, service provider, or
contractor performing work for the village will comply with the following
policies:
      (1)   With respect to internal electronic distribution, sensitive
information may be transmitted using approved village electronic mail; and
      (2)   With respect to external electronic distribution, sensitive
information should only be transmitted in an encrypted format and should
contain a statement such as this:
      "This message may contain sensitive, confidential and/or proprietary
information and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally
addressed. Any use by others is strictly prohibited."
   (C)   Responses when red flags detected. In the event village personnel
detect any identified red flags, such personnel should take one or more of the
following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red flag:
      (1)   Continue to monitor an account for evidence of identity theft;
      (2)   Contact the customer;
      (3)   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access
to covered accounts;
      (4)   Decline or otherwise refuse to open a new covered account;
      (5)   Close an existing covered account;
      (6)   Reopen a covered account with a new number;
      (7)   Notify the program administrator for determination of the
appropriate step(s) to take;
      (8)   Notify law enforcement; or
      (9)   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.67 UPDATES.
   This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to try and reflect
changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the village from identity
theft. At least once a year, the program administrator will consider the
village's experiences with identity theft, changes in identity theft methods,
changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of
accounts the village maintains and changes in the village's business
arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the program
administrator will determine whether changes to the program, including the
listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator
will update the program or present the Village President and Village Board with
his or her recommended changes and the Village President and Village Board will
make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to
the program.
(Res. 09-02, passed 3-2-2009)
§ 34.68 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating
this program lies with the Identity Theft Committee. The Committee shall be
headed by the program administrator or his or her appointee. Two or more other
individuals appointed by the corporate authorities shall comprise the remainder
of the committee membership. The program administrator will be responsible for
the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of village staff
on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red
flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining
which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular
circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program.
   (B)   Staff training and reports. Village staff responsible for implementing
the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program
administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be
taken when a red flag is detected. Further training shall also be provided on a
yearly basis or as needed to address changes in the program.
   (C)   Service provider arrangements. In the event the village engages a
service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered
accounts, the village will take the following steps to ensure the service
provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and
procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft.
      (1)   Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and
procedures in place; and
      (2)   Require, by contract, that service providers review the village's
program and report any red flags to the program administrator.
   (D)   Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness
of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of
confidentiality regarding the village's specific practices relating to identity
theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program,
knowledge of such specific practices is to be limited to the program
administrator or identity theft committee and those employees who need to know
them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be
adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be
counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the
program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices
are listed in this document.

charging such offense. The prosecution shall be under and conform to the rules
of criminal procedure. Conviction shall require the establishment of the guilt
of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.
      (5)   A violation of §
34.17 may be prosecuted as a quasi-criminal offense by an attorney for the

§ 51.04 REVIEW OF WATER AND SEWER RATES.
   The adequacy of the water and sewer user service rates and charges shall be
reviewed annually by the certified public accountants for the village in their
annual audit report. If, at any time, the rates and charges are not sufficient
to pay the costs of operation and maintenance, to provide adequate funds for
replacement, and to pay the principal and interest of outstanding bonds and
provide bond reserve funds required by bond ordinances, the Village Board of
Trustees shall forthwith increase the rates and charges so that the same are
sufficient to provide adequate revenues for those purposes.
(1983 Code, § 7-3-4)
§ 51.05 BILLS AND LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Water and sewer user service charges shall be billed on a bi-monthly
basis to all users. Payment shall be due not less than 15 days after the date
of the bill. If payment of the entire amount of the bill for water and/or sewer
user service charges is not received by the village on or before the due date,
then a late payment penalty of 20% of the unpaid balance of the bill shall be
added thereto and become due and payable.
   (B)   The owner or occupant of a property who has not paid the water and/or
sewer bill when due shall be sent a notice indicating that a penalty is due in
addition to the delinquent bill. The owner or occupant shall have ten days from
the date of the notice to pay the delinquent bill and penalties in full.
   (C)   If the water and/or sewer user service charges, including any penalty
then due, are not paid in full by the date specified in the delinquency notice,
the service shall be discontinued without further notice and shall not be
reinstated until all past due bills including the penalties thereon are paid in
full, together with an additional payment of $100 for shutting off and
reinstating the services.
   (D)   In the event the water and/or sewer user service charges including any
penalty then due are not paid by the date specified in the delinquency notice,
the charges and penalty shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be
delinquent, and thereafter the village may file a notice of lien claim with the
County Recorder of Deeds. This notice of lien claim shall include the legal
description of the property to which sewer service was provided, the amount of
the unpaid user service charges and penalties, and a notice that the village
claims a lien for the stated amount as well as for all water and sewer service
user charges and penalties, subsequent to the period for which the bill was
rendered. Wherever the person whose user service charges are delinquent is not
the owner of the property to which service was provided by the village, and the
village has previously received notice of this, notice of delinquency and lien
shall be mailed to the owner of the property if his or her address is known by
the village. The failure of the village to record the lien with the County
Recorder of Deeds, or to mail the notice of delinquency and lien to the owner
of the property, or failure of the owner to receive the notice shall not affect
the right of the village to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in
the section.
   (E)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid water and/or sewer user service
charges may be foreclosed in the same manner as mortgages and judgments on or
against real estate are foreclosed.
   (F)   In addition to filing a notice of lien, the village may file a civil
suit against owners or occupants whose utility bills have been delinquent for
at least 30 days. In addition to all delinquent amounts and fees, the owner or
occupant shall pay the village's actual attorney's fees and costs in seeking
recovery for nonpayment for such utility services.
   (G)   The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof, and the user of the
water and/or sewer service shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the
service to the premises, and the service is furnished to the premises by the
village only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and
user of the service are jointly and severally liable therefor to the village.

pursuant to 40 C.F.R. pt. 136, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite sample or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally,
but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour
composite samples, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)
   (K)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor by

§ 54.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of- way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways, and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and

§ 54.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Village
Engineer within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and

§ 54.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time, and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 2018-09, passed 8-6-2018) Penalty, see §
54.99
§ 54.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings, and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
54.21. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.

obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the

section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A) of this section, or the requirements of divisions
(B), (C), and (D). A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the

§ 54.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits, and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter, including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Engineer
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this division for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14- day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs, or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division
(C).
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C).
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss, or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss, or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding, or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall
affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

§ 54.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Village Engineer determines that the
proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with, the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right- of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of- way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (for example, a new cable may be installed in existing
conduit without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-ground
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90° angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or

provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. Part 192.707).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports,
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure, or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;

         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the Village
Engineer (Director of Public Works) from the edge of the pavement. Pits for
boring or jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring
or jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced,
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six

practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Village Engineer.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Village Engineer, the utility, at its expense, shall remove any
pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed facility, place and
properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk,
curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the Village
Engineer.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (A)(4)
is permitted under §
54.21, the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Village Engineer;
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village;
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth; and
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided
and maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for
minimum cover for the type of facility.
 
Type of Facility                       Minimum Cover

right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades, or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Village Engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the

whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified
in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Village Engineer may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations, or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Village Engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision, or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Village
Engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to

            1.   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
            2.   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the
application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which
incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for
consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate
permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.
         (f)   Duration of permits.
            1.   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less
than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations
unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the
new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or
any provision, condition, or requirement contained in this section.
            2.   If the Act is repealed as provided in § 90 therein, renewals
of permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
         (g)   Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information, and notices to the village by personal
delivery at the village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
      (3)   Collocation requirements and conditions.
         (a)   Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space
on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
         (b)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall
install, maintain, repair, and modify its small wireless facilities in safe
condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and
conditions of this section. The wireless provider shall ensure that its
employees, agents, or contractors that perform work in connection with its
small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with
all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations.
         (c)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies.
            1.   The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless
facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety
agency for public safety communications.
            2.   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment.
            3.   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured
in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
            4.   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC,
including 47 C.F.R. Parts 22.970 through 22.973, and 47 C.F.R. Parts 90.672
through 90.675.
            5.   The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in
compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in division 4. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
         (d)   1.   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole
or the electric supply zone of the pole.
            2.   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small
wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village
utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the
wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of
the pole.
            3.   For purposes of this division, the terms COMMUNICATIONS SPACE,
COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the meanings
given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
         (e)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
         (f)   The wireless provider shall comply with the following design
standards and any variations from these design standards may only be granted
pursuant to the variance provisions of this chapter at §
54.21.
            1.   Screening. Whenever any equipment or appurtenances are to be
installed at grade, screening must be installed to minimize the visibility of
the facility and shall not be permitted to obstruct sight lines or to create
other traffic or safety problems.
            2.   Color and stealth. All wireless facilities subject to this
section, including all related equipment and appurtenances, must be a color
that blends with the surroundings of the pole, structure tower, or
infrastructure on which it is mounted. The color must be comprised of non-
reflective materials which blend with the materials and colors of the
surrounding area and structures. The applicant shall use good faith efforts to
employ reasonable stealth techniques to conceal the appearance of the wireless
facilities. Any pole extensions shall not be metallic or wood and shall blend
with the color of the pole upon which they are mounted.
            3.   Wiring and cabling. Wires and cables connecting the antenna to
the remainder of the facility must be installed in accordance with the National
Electrical Code and National Electrical Safety Code adopted by the village and
in force at the time of the installation of the facility. Any wiring must be
covered with an appropriate cover. No wiring and cabling serving the facility
will be allowed to interfere with any existing uses.
         (g)   Alternate placements.
            1.   Except as provided in this division (C)(3), a wireless
provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be
required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole.
However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless
facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the
small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which
the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure
on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure
does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by
the applicant.
            2.   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the
village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the
property rights, technical limits, or material cost reasons the alternate
location does not satisfy the criteria in this division.
         (h)   Height limitations.
            1.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no
more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated.
            2.   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support
structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the
higher of:
               A.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure,
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
               B.   Forty five feet above ground level.
         (i)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a
height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations
on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in the manner provided in §
54.21.
         (j)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and
a private property owner that concern design or construction standards
applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-
of- way.
         (k)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. Subject to the variance
provisions of §
54.21 and state law, the wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing
requirements in the provisions of this chapter concerning the location of
ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
         (l)   Undergrounding regulations. Subject to the variance provisions
of §
54.21 and state law, the wireless provider shall comply with the provisions of
this chapter concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the
installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-
of- way without prior approval.
         (m)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit
is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit,
unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a
delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack
of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
      (4)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows.
         (a)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an
application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless
facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one
small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support
structures.
         (b)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of
a new utility pole for such collocation.
         (c)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
         (d)   The village shall not require an application, approval, or
permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service
provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
            1.   Routine maintenance;
            2.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless
facilities that are substantially similar, the same size or smaller, if the
wireless provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment type and model numbers for any of the
replacement equipment; or
            3.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
         (e)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to
work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or
require lane closures.
      (5)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this section authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
         (a)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or
controlled by the village or another unit of local government that is not
located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless
support structure without the consent of the property owner;
         (b)   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
         (c)   1.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under § 18c-
7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public
commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in § 16-102 of the
Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter
rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this section do not apply
to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if
the facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the
provisions of § 16-108.5(i) of the Public Utilities Act.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, PUBLIC UTILITY has the
meaning given to that term in § 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement to
obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable service or
video service; or to obtain any required permission to install, place,
maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless
facilities subject to this section.
      (6)   Pre-existing agreements.
         (a)   Existing agreements between the village and wireless providers
that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-
way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on village utility
poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small
wireless facilities collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to
applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to
applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this section.
         (b)   A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the
village on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees, and terms
that the village makes available under this section for the collocation of
small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the
collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application
submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying
the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees, and terms. The existing
agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for
the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the
village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village
before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option
under this division.
      (7)   Annual recurring rate.
         (a)   A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring
rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located
in a right-of-way that equals $200 per year; or the actual, direct, and
reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the village
utility pole.
         (b)   If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and
direct costs, the fee shall be $200 payable on the first day after the first
annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
      (8)   Abandonment.
         (a)   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility
shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of
written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment.
         (b)   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
         (c)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village
if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of
the village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the
new wireless provider.
   (D)   Dispute resolution. The Circuit Court of DeKalb County shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for
collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the
right-of-way, the village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on
its poles at annual rates of no more than $200 per year per municipal utility
pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
   (E)   Indemnification. A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the
village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or
property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use
or occupancy of the village improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this section and the
Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall
further waive any claims that they may have against the village with respect to
consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the
theory of liability.
   (F)   Insurance.
      (1)   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own
cost and expense, such insurance as is required by this chapter at §
54.08.
      (2)   The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
      (3)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless
provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds
under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability
to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

§ 54.23 ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-09, passed 8-6-2018)
§ 54.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when
the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and
this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

§ 76.03 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (A)   Probable cause. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to
believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to
this chapter, the police officer shall cause the motor vehicle to be removed or
towed to a facility authorized by the village. When the motor vehicle is
removed or towed, the police officer shall notify or make a reasonable attempt
to notify the owner, lessee, or any person who is found to be in control of the
motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation(s), if there is such a
person, of the fact of the seizure as provided in this section and of the
vehicle owner's or lessee's right to an administrative hearing. The police
officer shall also provide notice that the motor vehicle shall be impounded
pending the completion of the hearing provided for in this chapter, unless the
owner of record, lessee, or a lienholder of record of the motor vehicle posts
with the village a cash bond as set forth in this §
76.03 and pays for all towing and storage charges.
   (B)   Necessary and reasonable. A police officer who has probable cause to
believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to
this chapter shall first ascertain whether the seizure and impoundment is
necessary and reasonable under the circumstances. If in the judgment of the
police officer then present, a person authorized by the owner of record, lessee
or the operator of the motor vehicle is present and capable to legally provide
for the immediate removal of the motor vehicle, and said motor vehicle is not
required to be held as evidence in regard to the violation, the police officer
may allow that individual to promptly remove the motor vehicle without it being
subject to seizure and impoundment if seizure and impoundment of the motor
vehicle is discretionary pursuant to §
76.02 or seizure and impoundment of the motor vehicle is contemplated pursuant
to §
76.02.
   (C)   Posting bond. If a bond in the amount of $400 is posted with the
village, the impounded motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record,
lessee, or a lienholder of record upon the payment of the towing and storage
costs to the applicable towing company. If an administrative fee is imposed
pursuant to §
76.04, the bond will be applied to said fee, provided that in the event that a
violation of this chapter is not proven, the bond shall be returned to the
person posting the bond. All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall
be held by the village until a hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there
is a judicial review, until a reviewing court issues a final decision.
   (D)   Preliminary hearing. Where the owner of record or a lessee of a motor
vehicle seized under the provisions of this chapter makes a request in writing
and files with the Chief of Police or his/her designee, for a preliminary
hearing within 24 hours after the seizure of the motor vehicle, the Chief of
Police or his/her designee must conduct a preliminary hearing within 24 hours
after the request for a preliminary hearing is received by the village,
provided that if the date for the hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the next business day
following the Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this section,
the following shall apply:
      (1)   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
be heard at the preliminary hearing.
      (2)   The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the preliminary
hearing, and hearsay testimony shall be allowed, if it is the type commonly
relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.
      (3)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the Chief of Police or
his/her designee determines that there is probable cause to believe that the
motor vehicle was used in the commission of a violation listed in §
76.02, the Chief of Police or his/his designee shall order the continued
impoundment of the motor vehicle, unless the owner of record, lessee, or a
lienholder posts a cash bond with the village in the amount of $400 and pays
the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company, as set forth in
§
76.04.
      (4)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the Chief of Police or
his/her designee determines that there is not probable cause to believe that
the motor vehicle was used in the commission of a violation listed in §
76.02, the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record, lessee, or
lienholder of record of the motor vehicle without any fees or other costs, but
the owner of record or lessee shall be responsible to pay any towing or storage
charges to the applicable towing company.
(Ord. 14-02, passed 1-13-2014; Ord. 2020-01, passed 2-3-2017)
§ 76.04 PLEA HEARING/EVIDENTIARY HEARING.
   (A)   Notice of hearing. Within 10 days after a motor vehicle is impounded
pursuant to this chapter, the village shall notify the owner of record or
lessee and any lienholder of record of the date, time, and location of a plea
hearing that shall be conducted pursuant to §
76.04. Such notice shall be served by first class mail to the address
registered with the Secretary of State or by personal service to the owner of
record or lessee and any lienholder of record. The plea hearing shall be
conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Board of Trustees. The owner
of record or lessee may appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or
not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, or if the owner of record or lessee
fails to appear, the cause shall be disposed of at that time, with an order or
a default order in favor of the village, which order or default order shall
require the payment to the village of the $400 administrative fee and the
payment of towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company, and the
continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record, lessee,
or lienholder of record pays to the village the $400 administrative fee and
pays the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the
owner of record, lessee, or lienholder of record has previously posted the bond
authorized by §
76.03 and paid the applicable towing and storage costs to the towing company
for the release of the vehicle, then no further fees or costs shall be due. If
the owner of record or lessee pleads not guilty, an evidentiary hearing shall
be scheduled and held not later than 45 days after the motor vehicle was
impounded, unless continued by the hearing officer. All interested persons
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the evidentiary hearing.
At any time prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the hearing officer may, at
the request of either the village or the owner of record or lessee, direct
witnesses to appear and give testimony at the evidentiary hearing. The formal
rules of evidence shall not apply at the evidentiary hearing, and hearsay
evidence shall be admissible if it is the type commonly relied upon by
reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.
   (B)   If, after the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer determines, by
a preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was used in connection
with a violation set forth in §
76.02, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record or
lessee of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative
fee in the amount of $400 and require the motor vehicle to continue to be
impounded until the owner of record, lessee, or lienholder of record pays the
administrative fee to the village and also pays the applicable towing and
storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the owner of record or
lessee fails to appear at the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer shall
enter a default order in favor of the village, which order shall require the
payment to the village of the $400 administrative fee and the payment of the
towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company, and the continued
impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record or lessee pays the
village the $400 administrative fee and pays the towing and storage costs to
the applicable towing company. If the owner of record, lessee, or a lienholder
of record has previously posted the bond authorized by §
76.03 and paid the applicable towing and storage costs to the towing company
for the release of the vehicle, then no further fees or costs shall be due. The
$400 administrative fee shall be a debt due to the village, and the village may
seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment as provided by
law.
   (C)   If after a hearing the hearing officer finds no such violation
occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the motor
vehicle to the owner of record, lessee, or lienholder of record without any fee
or other costs, or, if a cash bond has previously been posted, the cash bond
shall be returned. However, the village shall not be responsible for the
payment of towing or storage fees. If the hearing officer finds that the
village exceeded its authority in seizing and impounding a motor vehicle, the
village shall be liable to the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle
for the cost of storage fees and reasonable attorney's fees.
   (D)   At the evidentiary hearing, the citation setting forth the violation
shall be prima facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in
the citation, and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of record to
prove that the violation was not committed.

§ 76.05 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED MOTOR VEHICLE.
   If the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within 35
days after an administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record or
lessee who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing provided in §
76.04, or who admits guilt at the plea hearing, the motor vehicle shall be
deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the
disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/4-201 et seq.,

   (B)   This chapter is in addition to and shall not replace or otherwise
abrogate any existing state or federal laws or any ordinance that relates to
the seizure or impoundment of motor vehicles, and any fee provided for in this
chapter shall be in addition to any and all penalties that may be assessed or
imposed by a court for any criminal charges.
   (C)   This chapter shall not apply:
      (1)   If the motor vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time
of the violation and the theft was reported to the appropriate police
authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered;
      (2)   If the motor vehicle is operated as a common carrier as defined by
applicable law and the violation occurs without the knowledge of the person in
control of the motor vehicle; or
      (3)   If the motor vehicle is subject to successful forfeiture
proceedings under 725 ILCS 150/1 et seq., as amended (Drug Asset Forfeiture
Procedure Act); 720 ILCS 5/36-1 et seq., as amended (Seizure and Forfeiture of
Vessels, Vehicles and Aircrafts), or other state or federal forfeiture laws.

   Any owner of record, lien holder, or other person with a legal interest in
the motor vehicle shall have the right to appeal the decision of the hearing
officer to the circuit court of the 16th judicial circuit of the county
pursuant to the Administrative Review Act, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq., as
amended. The hearing in administrative review shall be limited to the record of
the hearing before the hearing officer. Any person seeking administrative
review of a final decision shall be required to reimburse the village for the
costs of preparing and certifying the record of proceedings. The failure of the
person seeking administrative review to reimburse the village shall be grounds
for the dismissal of a complaint for administrative review which is brought
pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/3-101. In the event the reviewing court reverses the
findings, decision, or order of the hearing officer, the village shall
reimburse the respondent for the costs for preparing and certifying the record
of proceedings.

the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-1426.1, which is hereby adopted by the
village, and to the provisions of this chapter, both of which may be amended

roadways of the village shall be authorized to register and, if approved,
operate golf carts on the streets under the jurisdiction of the village (hereby
excluding state and county roads, including but not limited to Illinois Route
72) having a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less. Golf carts may
not be operated on sidewalks or other public property not accessible to or
authorized to vehicular traffic, unless otherwise authorized by the Village
Board for special events. Golf cart operators must yield the right-of-way to
overtaking vehicles at all times. Golf carts shall not be operated in inclement
weather or when visibility is impaired by weather, smoke, fog, or other
conditions. Each golf cart may transport only as many individuals as is the
number of seats designated by the golf cart manufacturer.
   (C)   Restrictions on crossing highways. A golf cart shall only be permitted

   (E)   Annual registration of golf carts. No golf cart shall be operated on
any roadway of the village unless the owner(s) thereof shall have first
registered the golf cart with the village in accordance with the following:

Police or his or her designee and applications for registration shall be made
on a form prescribed by the village, said form to include a waiver and release
of all claims against the village, a statement under oath or penalties of
perjury that the golf cart proposed to be registered meets the definition under

for in division (D) herein, and shall be accompanied by an annual registration
fee of $50 and proof of liability insurance for said golf cart having at least
the limits as required from time to time for motor vehicles under the mandatory

registration. Registrations obtained after May 1 of a given year will still
expire on April 30, requiring a new registration, even if the initial
registration covered less than a full year.
      (4)   Registrations shall not be transferable in the event of change of
ownership. If it is desired that more than one person is registered to operate
a single golf cart, each person shall separately complete an application, be
approved, and sign the release, in substantially the form prescribed by the
village.
      (5)   Registrations shall be subject to revocation by the village in the
event of a violation of the requirements of § 11-1426.1 of the Illinois Vehicle
Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-1426.1 or any of the provisions of this chapter. A
revocation shall be made in writing and shall set forth the provision(s) of
statute or ordinance found to be violated. Revocations may be appealed in
writing to the Village Board within 14 days from the issuance of the
revocation, and if appealed, the Village Board shall hold a public hearing at
which the affected owner may appear, present witnesses and evidence, and be
represented by an attorney. The Village Board shall uphold the revocation if it
determines by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing that the
violation which was the basis for the revocation occurred. During the appeal
process, the revocation shall remain in full force and effect.
      (6)   In the event a registration is revoked due to a failure to maintain
the required liability insurance or a failure to maintain the condition of the
golf cart in compliance with this chapter, including but not limited to,
maintaining the required safety systems, the village, in its discretion, may
reinstate the registration upon documentation of reinstatement of the required
insurance or of the repair or modification of the golf cart necessary to cure
any deficiencies, as applicable, if the village determines that the violation
was not intentional and is not likely to recur.
   (F)   Inspection of golf carts. Golf carts registered, or proposed to be
registered, pursuant to this chapter, shall be subject to inspection by the
Chief of Police or his or her designee, at any time to determine that said golf
cart meets, and continues to meet, the definition thereof as set forth in this
chapter, and meets the requirements of division (D) of this section, and
particularly that the required safety systems and equipment are in operating
condition.
   (G)   Mandatory insurance. The owner of any golf cart registered under this
chapter shall continuously maintain liability insurance for said golf cart
having at least the same limits as required from time to time for motor

at all times in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code,
the rules of the road contained therein, and any other laws, regulations or
ordinances governing the operation of motor vehicles in the village, as well as
any laws, regulations or ordinances specifically pertaining to golf carts and
the operation thereof.
   (J)   Violations. In addition to the revocation of the registration for golf
carts as provided in this chapter, any person violating the provisions of this
chapter shall be subject to revocation of any registration and a fine of not
less than $75 and not more than $150. The provisions hereof for prosecuting

VACANT BUILDINGS
§ 91.10 LIENS FOR PROPERTY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES FOR VACANT BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Vacant building defined. A VACANT BUILDING is a building or portion of
a building as defined in 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15.1 as an "abandoned residential
property," being a residential dwelling unit that has been unoccupied by any
lawful occupant or occupants for at least 90 days, and for which after such 90
day period the village has made good faith efforts to contact the legal owner
or owners of the property or, if known, the agent of the owner, and no contact
has been made.
   (B)   Nuisance declared. Vacant buildings which are indefinitely vacant and
in a state of disrepair or boarded are public nuisances in that they contribute
to the decrease in value of surrounding properties, precipitate disinvestment
by neighboring owners, provide a location for criminal activity, undermine the
aesthetic character of the neighborhood and village, and have other undesirable
effects.
   (C)   Nuisance abatement. The village is authorized to perform or provide
for property maintenance activities to abate the nuisance caused by a vacant
building, including the following: §
91.02 and by §§
91.45 through
91.48 and:
      (1)   Cutting and removal of neglected weeds, grass, trees, and bushes as
authorized by §§
91.45 through
91.48 and 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7;

ILCS 5/11-20-8;

91.47 and 65 ILCS 5/11-20-12;
      (4)   Removal of garbage, debris, and graffiti and related activities as
authorized by § 91.02 and other sections of this Code and 65 ILCS 5/11-20-13;
and
      (5)   Removal, securing, and enclosing of abandoned residential
properties as authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1.01.
   (D)   Charges for nuisance abatement. The village shall have the authority
to collect from the property owner the costs incurred in performing the
property maintenance activities to abate the nuisances described in this
section. The village shall send a bill for the cost to the property owner, his
agent, legal representative, or occupant in legal possession or control of the
premises.
   (E)   Traditional lien procedure. If a bill sent pursuant to division (D) of
this section is not paid in full within 30 days of the date of the bill, the
village shall have the authority to file and record a lien against the
property, pursuant to Section 11-20-15 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS
5/11-20-15. If, for any one property, the village engaged in any nuisance
abatement activity described in division (C) of this section on more than one
occasion during the course of one year, then the village may combine any or all
of the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien. The lien must be
filed in accordance with the lien procedure established by the specific Code
provision of which the property is alleged to be in violation or, if no such
procedure exists, then the following procedure shall apply:
      (1)   Notice of lien.
         (a)   The village or the person performing the service by authority of
the village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of lien in the
office of the recorder of deeds in the county in which the real estate is
located. The notice of lien shall be filed within one year after the cost and
expense is incurred.

the parcel;
            2.   The amount of the cost and expense incurred or payable for the
activities; and
            3.   The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by
the village or someone working on behalf of the village.
         (c)   After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified
mail to the property owner, his agent or legal representative or occupant in
legal possession or control of the premises and, if different, to the person
who received the tax bill for the preceding year.
      (2)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (3)   Foreclosure of lien. Subsequent to the filing of the above-
described lien, the village may cause to be filed a complaint for foreclosure
of such lien, or upon becoming a defendant in a pending lawsuit affecting the
premises or real estate, by answer to the complaint or in the nature of an
intervening petition or cross-complaint the village may proceed in its
corporate name to foreclose such lien. An action to foreclose a lien under this
section must be commenced within two years after the date of filing notice of
lien. The property subject to a lien arising under this section shall be sold
for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to

priority lien procedure described in this division (F) shall apply only to
costs incurred for property maintenance activities performed on abandoned
residential properties, as defined in this section, and is an alternative to

the date of the bill, the village shall have the authority to file and record a
priority lien against the property, pursuant to Section 11-20-15.1 of the

the village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of a priority lien
in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county in which the real estate
is located. The notice of lien shall be filed within one year after the cost
and expense is incurred. If, for any one property, the village engaged in any
nuisance abatement activity described in division (C) of this section on more
than one occasion during the course of one year, then the village may combine
any or all of the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien.
         (b)   The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting

or someone working on behalf of the village; and
            4.   A statement that the lien has been filed pursuant to one or
more of the property maintenance activities described in division (C) of this
section and authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7(d), 65 ILCS 5/11-20-8(d), 65 ILCS

mail to the property owner, his agent or legal representative or occupant in
legal possession or control of the premises and, if different, to the person
who received the tax bill for the preceding year.

notice to the village that the lender has performed, or will perform, remedial
actions; provided, however, that the remedial actions must be performed or
initiated in good faith within 30 days of the lender's notice to the village.
      (2)   Recordkeeping. To enforce a lien pursuant to this division (F), the

has become abandoned residential property;
         (b)   The date when the property was first observed to be unoccupied
by any lawful occupant;
         (c)   A description of the actions taken by the village to contact the
legal owner of the property, or if known, any agent of the owner;
         (d)   A statement that no contacts were made with the legal owner or,

the work and the rates and estimated cost of the work, if applicable;
         (g)   Detailed invoices and payment vouchers for the work; and
         (h)   A statement whether the work was competitively bid, and if so, a
copy of all proposals submitted by the bidders.
      (3)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (4)   Enforcement of lien. A lien under this division (F) is enforceable
by the village, or entity or person who performs work on behalf of the village,
at the hearing for confirmation of the foreclosure sale of the abandoned
residential property and is limited to a claim of interest in the proceeds of
the sale. The priority lien is superior to all other liens and encumbrances,

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the powers granted to the Village of
Kirkland, Illinois (Kirkland), by the Illinois Compiled Statutes and Illinois
Drainage Law, being 70 ILCS 605/1-1 et seq.
(Ord. 07-02, passed 4-16-2007)
§ 151.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to persons,
property and the environment caused by excess stormwater runoff from new
development and redevelopment; to promote the public health, safety and welfare
by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and
maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the
topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in
Kirkland. It is the intention of this chapter that land disturbing activities
not result in an increase in the rate of or the location of stormwater runoff
from properties in order to safeguard adjoining properties from the negative
impacts of such runoff. Further, it is intended to require the temporary
storage and the control of the rate of release of excess stormwater runoff
between dominant and subservient estates.
   (B)   It is DeKalb County’s intention that by encouraging communities
throughout the county to adopt and enforce this chapter within their municipal
jurisdictions, water quality will not be negatively impacted by continued urban
development. In addition, adoption of this chapter by communities within the
county will present development with a consistent set of requirements for
addressing stormwater management.
(Ord. 07-02, passed 4-16-2007)

existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      (1)   Overlapping or multiple jurisdictions. In all cases where a
development lies within the jurisdictional boundaries of more than one
municipality or regulatory authority, the development shall conform to the
requirements of all applicable jurisdictions. In cases where the requirements
of the municipality or regulatory authority are in conflict, the more
restrictive requirement shall be followed.
      (2)   Adjacent jurisdictions. In all cases where a development lies
within one and one-half miles of the corporate limits of an incorporated
municipality, the development shall conform to all applicable ordinances and
plans of the municipality in addition to the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Additional jurisdictions list.  Municipalities, districts and
regulatory authorities from which fees, approval and/or permits may be required
may include (but are not limited to) the following divisions (a) through (k).

crossings shall be constructed of non-erosive material.
         (b)   The time and area of disturbance of a stream shall be kept to a
minimum. The stream, including bed and banks, shall be restablized within 48
hours after channel disturbance is completed or interrupted.
      (6)   Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be appropriate
with regard to the amount of tributary drainage area as follows:
         (a)   Disturbed areas draining greater than 5,000 square feet but less
than one acre shall, at a minimum, be protected by a filter barrier (including
filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures) to control all off-
site runoff. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 feet, may be
used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
         (b)   Disturbed areas draining more than one but fewer than five acres
shall, at a minimum, be protected by a sediment trap or equivalent control
measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
         (c)   Disturbed areas draining more than five acres, shall, at a
minimum, be protected by a sediment basin with a perforated filter riser pipe
or equivalent control measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
         (d)   1.   Sediment basins shall have both a permanent pool (dead
storage) and additional volume (live storage) with each volume equal to the
runoff amount of a two-year, 24-hour event over the on-site hydrologically
disturbed tributary drainage area to the sediment basin.
            2.   If the detention basin for the proposed development condition
of the site is used for sediment basin, the above volume requirements will be
explicitly met. Until the site is finally stabilized, the basin permanent pool
of water shall meet the above volume requirements and have a filtered
perforated riser protecting the outflow pipe.
      (7)   All storm sewers that are or will be functioning during
construction shall be protected by an appropriate sediment control measure.
      (8)   If dewatering services are used, adjoining properties and discharge
locations shall be protected from erosion. Discharges shall be routed through
an effective sediment control measure (e.g., sediment trap, sediment basin or
other appropriate measure).
      (9)   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soil areas shall be permanently stabilized.
      (10)   A stabilized mat of aggregate underlain with filter cloth (or
other appropriate measure) shall be located at any point where traffic will be
entering or leaving a construction site to or from a public right-of-way,
street, alley or parking area. Any sediment or soil reaching an improved public
right-of-way, street, alley or parking area shall be removed by scraping or
street cleaning as accumulations warrant and transported to a controlled
sediment disposal area.
      (11)   Earthen embankments shall be constructed with side slopes no
steeper than 3H:1V. Steeper slopes may be constructed with appropriate
stabilization as approved by the village.
      (12)   Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales and
diversions, and the outlet of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the ten-year frequency
storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
within 48 hours.
      (13)   Temporary diversions shall be constructed as necessary to direct
all runoff from hydrologically disturbed areas to the appropriate sediment trap
or basin.
      (14)   Soil stockpiles having greater than 100 yards of soil and
remaining in place for more than seven days shall not be located in a flood-
prone area or waters of the United States. Soil stockpile locations shall be
shown on the soil erosion and sediment control plan and shall have the
appropriate measures to prevent erosion of the stockpile.
      (15)   Soil erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be designed and
constructed per the requirements contained in the Illinois Urban Manual, 2002
(or current edition).

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
§ 151.070 FLOW FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS.
   (A)   Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be
considered in the design of the property’s stormwater management system.
Whenever practicable, undetained stormwater runoff from upstream areas that are
not providing detention should be routed around the basin being provided for
the applicant’s property.
   (B)   The following shall apply to upstream tributary areas:
      (1)   If upstream tributary flows are passed through the applicant’s
basin, then a detention volume safety factor of 5% shall be added to storage
volume required for the applicant’s property.
      (2)   If upstream tributary flows are passed through the applicant’s
detention basin, the final design release rates shall be based on the total
tributary area (the applicant’s property and upstream areas tributary to the
applicant’s property).
(Ord. 07-02, passed 4-16-2007)
§ 151.071 REGIONAL DETENTION EVALUATION.
   (A)   When upstream property tributary to the applicant’s property does not
meet the stormwater runoff storage and release requirements of this chapter,
regionalized detention on the applicant’s property shall be explored by the
applicant.
   (B)   The following steps shall be followed:
      (1)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his or
her property alone using the applicable release rates from this chapter, the
applicant’s property area, and the procedures described in this chapter.
      (2)   Upstream areas tributary to the applicant’s property not meeting
the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter shall be identified.
      (3)   The applicant shall compute the combined storage volume needed for
the total area (the applicant’s property and upstream areas tributary to the
applicant’s property) using the applicable release rates from this chapter, the
total area, and the procedures described in this chapter.
      (4)   If upstream tributary areas are not currently developed, a
reasonable fully developed land cover, based on anticipated zoning, shall be
assumed for the purposes of computing storage.
      (5)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the village may
choose to pay for increasing the size of the applicant’s detention basin to
accommodate the upstream area flows. The applicant’s responsibility will then
be limited to the required storage for his or her property alone.
      (6)   If regional storage is selected by the village, then the combined-
storage design computed above shall be implemented.

into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (4)   New and replacement on-site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal
systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Manholes or other above ground
openings located below the flood protection elevation shall be watertight.
      (5)   Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities
shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
flood-proofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet above the
level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation whichever is greater. Flood-
proofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances
will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated
to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all
critical facilities.
   (B)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.
(Ord. 08-22, passed 11-17-2008)
§ 152.09 CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION.
   For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained. In addition, the Village of Kirkland shall notify adjacent
communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the
alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
(Ord. 08-22, passed 11-17-2008)
§ 152.10 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Whenever the standards of this subchapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Code Official for
a variance. The Code Official shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit his/her recommendation to the Village Board. The
Village Board may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this subchapter.
   (B)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (C)   The City Council shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance
from the requirements of the building protections standards of §
152.06 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property, and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (D)   Variances to the building protection requirements of §
152.06 which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in the
definition of historic structures in §
152.01, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§§
152.05 and
152.06 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
(Ord. 08-22, passed 11-17-2008)
§ 152.11 LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this subchapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
subchapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This subchapter does not
create liability on the part of the Village of Kirkland or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this
subchapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 08-22, passed 11-17-2008)
§ 152.12 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This subchapter shall be in full force and effect on January 2, 2009, from
and after its passage, approval, and publication as required by law.
(Ord. 08-22, passed 11-17-2008)
ADMINISTRATION
§ 152.25 FLOOD INSURANCE ASSURANCE.
   (A)   (1)   The village hereby assures the Federal Insurance Administration
that it will enact as necessary, and maintain in force for those areas having
flood hazards, adequate land use and control measures with effective
enforcement provisions consistent with the criteria set forth in § 1910 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations; and vests the Zoning
Administrator with the responsibility, authority and means to:
         (a)   Delineate or assist the Administrator, at his or her request, in
delineating the limits of the areas having special flood hazards on available
local maps of sufficient scale to identify the location of building sites;
         (b)   Provide such information as the Administrator may request
concerning present uses and occupancy of the floodplain;
         (c)   Cooperate with federal, state and local agencies and private
firms which undertake to study, survey, map and identify the floodplain, and
cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to management of the
adjoining floodplain in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards; and
         (d)   Submit on the anniversary date of the community's initial
eligibility an annual report to the Administrator on the progress made during
the past year within the community in the development and implementation of
floodplain management measures.
      (2)   The village hereby appoints the Zoning Administrator to maintain
for public inspection and to furnish upon request a record of elevations (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
or substantially improved structures located in the special flood hazard areas.
If the lowest floor immediately above must also be recorded, and the village
agrees to take such other official action as may be reasonably necessary to
carry out the objectives of the program.
   (B)   (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall review all building permit
applications for new construction or substantial improvements to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is in a location that has a flood hazard, any proposed
new construction or substantial improvement (including prefabricated and mobile
homes) must:
         (a)   Be designed (or modified) and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
         (b)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage; and
         (c)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review subdivision proposals and
other proposed new developments to assure that:
         (a)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage;
         (b)   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems, are located, elevated and constructed to minimize
or eliminate flood damage; and
         (c)   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall require new or replacement water
supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters, and require on-site waste disposal systems to be
located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during
flooding.
(1983 Code, § 8-2-1) (Ord. 539, passed 12-2-1974; Ord. 540, passed 12-2-1974)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   (1)   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or
failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of §§
152.01 through
152.12.
      (2)   Upon due investigation, the Code Official may determine that a
violation of the minimum standards of §§
152.01 through
152.12 exist. The Code Official shall notify the owner in writing of such
violation.
      (3)   If the owner fails after ten-days’ notice to correct the violation:
         (a)   The Village Attorney shall make application to the circuit court
for an injunction requiring conformance with §§
152.01 through
152.12 or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure
compliance with §§
152.01 through
152.12.
         (b)   Any person who violates §§
152.01 through
152.12 shall upon conviction thereof be fined not less than $50 or more than
$750 for each offense.
         (c)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day
during or on which a violation occurs or continues, and
         (d)   The Village of Kirkland shall record a notice of violation on
the title of the property.
      (4)   (a)   The Village of Kirkland shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
         (b)   The Code Official is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
         (c)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Village Board. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
            1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation, and
            2.   The time and place of the hearing.
         (d)   At the hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City
Council shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
      (4)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village of Kirkland from taking
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   (B)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99.

§ 154.050 PURPOSE.
   The Agricultural District is established to provide for a continuation of
agricultural pursuits and to also provide a holding zone for areas required for
future urban developments and to promote the logical growth of uses in the
village. These areas are intended to be rezoned in accordance with the use
designations appearing on the Master Plan Map when urban development needs so
necessitate and when the logical extension of utilities and public facilities
can be ensured. This will discourage haphazard and premature development from
occurring at the fringes of the village.

transmit any energy to the electric distribution system within any period of 12
or more consecutive months; and (b) where the owner/operator is not pursuing
the repair of such solar farm will be presumed to have been abandoned. If the
village reasonably believes an abandonment to have occurred in accordance with
the prior sentence, the village shall provide written notification of such
belief to the owner/operator and the owner/operator shall have 30 days after
receipt of such written notice to reply to such notification with evidence
refuting such contention. In the event the owner/operator fails to refute such
contention within such 30-day period, the village may presume that the solar
farm has been abandoned unless, prior to the village: (i) accessing any cash or
letter of credit posted by owner as security for the decommissioning; or (ii)
taking over and commencing the decommissioning, the village is provided with
clear and convincing evidence otherwise.
            1.   Any solar farm that has been abandoned must be decommissioned
and removed within 180 days.
            2.   Decommissioning must consist of:
               a.   Physical removal of all solar panel installations,
structures, foundations, equipment, security barriers or fences and

firm outlining the anticipated means and costs of removing the solar farm must
be submitted with the building permit application associated with the special
use permit application.
               b.   The decommissioning plan shall ensure that the owner or
operator properly removes the equipment and facilities upon the end of project
life or after their useful life. The plan must include provisions for the
removal of all structures and foundations, the removal of all electrical
transmission components and the restoration of soil and vegetation in
accordance with this section.
               c.   The owner/operator must provide a present-day
decommissioning cost estimate and identify the parties responsible for
decommissioning. This estimate will include the cost to remove equipment, less
applicable salvage values.
               d.   The owner/operator must submit a summary of the
decommissioning plan to all property owners owning properties adjacent to the
solar farm site. Before issuance of a special use permit, the owner/operator of
the solar farm must provide to the Village Administrator a certificate signed
by the solar farm owner certifying that a summary of the decommissioning plan
has been sent by certified mail to all of such property owners. In addition,
prior to the issuance of a building permit for construction of a solar farm on
all, or a portion, of the property, the village shall require cash in an escrow
account or an irrevocable letter of credit, in an amount equal to 125% of the
present-day decommissioning cost estimate provided by the owner/operator under
§
154.051(H)(1)(i)3.a., designating the village as beneficiary, issued by a
financial institution with an office in Illinois upon which the letter of
credit may be drawn and substantially in the form attached to Ord. 2019-01 as
Exhibit A or otherwise in a form approved by the Village Attorney. The letter
of credit shall provide that the village may draw upon the funds upon the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a breach or failure by the owner
or operator to complete all or a portion of such plan; ( ii) a material breach
or failure to comply with any requirement or condition of any zoning ordinance
relative to a solar farm on the subject property; or (iii) such letter of
credit is about to expire and has not been, or will not automatically be
renewed; provided, however, that such draw shall not occur in the event of
items (i) and (ii) above unless owner has failed to cure such breach or failure
within 15 days of being notified in writing by the village of such breach or
failure. The village may also draw upon such letter of credit to compensate any
adjacent property owner for property proven to have been damaged as a direct
result of a drain tile on the subject property being damaged by the owner/
operator of the subject property. In the event that a letter of credit rather
than a cash escrow is utilized, such irrevocable letter of credit shall be
renewed by the owner of the subject property or operator of the solar farm
without interruption for the term of the special use permit. In the event that
such letter of credit lapses, such lapse shall result in the revocation of the
special use permit for the solar farm by the village if not remedied within 15
days of the village notifying the owner of such lapse or 30 days of such lapse.
         (j)   Monitoring and maintenance. The owner/operator of the solar farm
is responsible for keeping the solar farm in a safe, sound and well-maintained
condition, including painting, grounds keeping, structural repairs, internal
access drives and the integrity of security measures. The owner of the solar
farm will certify to the village at the start of commercial operations that the
solar farm is in compliance with the site plan, and its operation will comply
with all federal, state and local regulations in effect at that time.
         (k)   Avoidance and mitigation of damages to public infrastructure.
            1.   Roads. If the subject property is adjacent to a state route,
such state route shall be used for the purpose of transporting components and
equipment for construction, operation or maintenance of the solar farm. The
owner/operator shall obtain applicable permits from the applicable highway
authority prior to construction or as needed to remain in compliance with all
state laws and regulations.
            2.   Existing road conditions. The owner/operator must conduct a
pre-construction survey in coordination with the applicable highway authority
to determine the condition of existing roads within the village that will be
utilized by the solar farm. The pre-construction survey must include
photographs and a written agreement to document the condition of the roads and
applicable public facilities. The owner/operator is responsible for reasonable
ongoing road maintenance and dust-control measures identified by the applicable
highway authority for all vehicles used for construction of the solar farm
during all phases of construction and installation. The owner/operator shall
conduct, within 30 days of completing construction, a second video survey of
all existing roads used by the solar farm for construction activities. Prior to
starting construction, the owner/operator shall deliver or have delivered to
the village a letter of credit or cash escrow in the amount of $20,000 as
security for the village to cover, in the event of a failure of the owner/
operator to meet its obligations, the costs of the village performing the
obligations of the owner/operator to make any necessary road repairs to the
existing roads used by the solar farm for construction activities required due
to the impact of such construction activities on such roads. Such letter of
credit or cash escrow shall serve as the sole source and amount from owner/
operator to cover the costs incurred by the village for its undertaking any
such future road repairs to existing roads required due solely to solar farm
construction activities that the owner/operator has failed to perform. The
village shall release such letter of credit or cash escrow with any unused
amounts remaining thereon or therein upon completion of any such necessary road
repairs.
            3.   Drainage and detention systems. The owner/operator is
responsible for identifying the location of all drain tiles (or, alternatively,

subsurface drainage systems on the property and submitting such information to
the village at the time of application. In addition, the applicant shall
identify detention, drain tile (or, alternatively, the information required in
§
154.051(H)(1)(k)3.), or subsurface drainage systems that will be incorporated
into the site stormwater permit and for preparing a plan for maintaining such
drainage systems during construction and operation of the solar facility.
Owner/operator is responsible for repairing, at all times, including but not
limited to as part of decommissioning, any damage to drain tiles and other
drainage systems that result from construction, operation, or maintenance of
the solar farm.
         (l)   Financial assurance. The owner/operator must provide reasonable
evidence of financial ability to construct the solar farm and all required
improvements, as determined by the Village Board at the time of special use
permit approval.
         (m)   Height. The height of any solar energy system, including panels,
shall not exceed 12 feet and six inches as measured from adjoining grade at
base to the highest elevation of the equipment, when oriented at maximum tilt
position. This limitation does not apply to transmission lines and
interconnection facilities or operations and maintenance facilities.

CONSERVANCY DISTRICTS
§ 154.100 PURPOSE.
   The intent of the Conservancy District is to identify, in undeveloped areas,
the location of soils which have a high probability of imposing development
difficulties for urban-type developments. The delineation and interpretation of
soil conditions is based upon soils information provided by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Soils Conservation Service. Where a developer or owner can
demonstrate that either on-site soils tests show that the soils are adequate to
accommodate the type of development contemplated; or development plans clearly
indicate that construction methods will overcome any inherent soil
difficulties, the parcel in question should be rezoned to a district consistent
with the uses indicated on the Master Plan Map.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 154.125 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of
the public streets and to promote the safety and welfare of the public by
establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put.
(1983 Code, § 9-10-1) (Ord. 09-07, passed 9-8-2009)
§ 154.126 GENERAL PROVISIONS; PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this subchapter shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this subchapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations and the
district in which the building or uses are located; however, where a permit has
been issued prior to the effective date of this subchapter, and provided that
construction has begun within 90 days of the effective date, and completed
within a year, parking and loading facilities as required hereinafter need not
be provided.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in the intensity of use.
      (3)   No building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this subchapter shall be required to
provide such additional parking or loading facilities, unless and until the
aggregate increase in units of measurement shall equal not less than 15% of the
units of measurement existing upon the effective date of this subchapter, in
which event parking or loading facilities are required shall be provided for
the total increase.
      (4)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall be
changed hereafter to a new use, parking and loading facilities shall be
provided as required for the new use. If the building or structure was erected
prior to the effective date of this subchapter, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the
new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to
the parking and loading provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served and which were in existence on the effective date of this subchapter or
were provided voluntarily after the effective date shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below, the
requirements of this subchapter for a similar new building or use.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this subchapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of the facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this subchapter,
which subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time
of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation;
however, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or
loading facilities in excess of those required by this subchapter for
equivalent new uses or construction.
   (E)   Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and
unless the Planning and Zoning Commission has reviewed the plans and heard the
applicant and made findings that the common ownership or possession of the
zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to
continue, and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all
times during the life of the proposed use or building.
(1983 Code, § 9-10-2) (Ord. 09-07, passed 9-8-2009)
§ 154.127 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS; PARKING.
   (A)   Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to
residential use and developed in any residential district in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter shall be used solely for the parking of
passenger automobiles owned by occupants of the dwelling structures to which
the facilities are accessory or by guests of the occupants. Under no
circumstances shall required parking facilities accessory to residential
structures be used for the storage of commercial vehicles or for the parking of
automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants, visitors or customers
of business or manufacturing establishments.
   (B)   Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively
in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so
located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements of
each use.
   (C)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this subchapter results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in
excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   (D)   Size.
      (1)   A required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet in
width and at least 20 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles,
ramps, columns or office or work areas. The space shall have a vertical
clearance of at least seven feet.
      (2)   Aisle widths shall be less than the following, perpendicular
parking 20 feet; angle parking two-way traffic 16 feet, one-way 12 feet.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movements. No driveway across public property, nor curb cut, shall exceed a
width of 40 feet.
   (F)   In yards. Off-street parking required for uses permitted in
residential districts may be located in a required rear yard only. Off-street
parking for permitted uses in manufacturing, industrial or business districts
may be located in a required rear or front yard, except the 20 feet adjacent to
the front lot line and ten feet adjacent to the rear lot line.

elsewhere than on the same lot occupied by the use served shall be open to the
sky except when otherwise allowed.
   (B)   Screening and landscaping. All open automobile parking areas
containing more than four parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each
side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a residence district or
any institutional property by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge
not less than five feet nor more than seven feet in height. Such required
screening shall conform with the front yard requirements of the district in
which the parking is located.
   (C)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas, except a single parking
space accessory to a one-family dwelling, shall be improved with a compacted

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
§ 154.160 PURPOSE.
   Planned developments are intended to encourage the most imaginative and best
possible design of building forms and site planning for tracts of land where
unitary plans would best adapt to topographic and other natural features of
such sites. Under this procedure, well-planned residential, industrial,
commercial and other types of land use, individually or in combination, may be
developed with complete design flexibility. Planned developments must be
environmentally compatible. They should have a more beneficial effect upon the
health, safety and general welfare of the people of the village, and
particularly in the immediate surroundings, than would developments built in
conformity with standard district regulations. Sites of planned developments
shall be of sufficient size to accommodate self-contained developments and to
create their own character. Planned developments are of such substantially
different character from other special uses that the following additional
standards are established to guard against their use solely as a means of
intensifying the use of land.
(1983 Code, § 9-13-10-1) (Ord. 09-07, passed 9-8-2009)
§ 154.161 ZONING MAP.
   Approved planned developments shall be delineated and designated by number
on the Zoning District Map. A file, available for inspection by the public,
shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator for each planned development so
designated. The file shall contain a record of the approved development plan
and all exceptions authorized therein.

Zoning Commission. At this conference the applicant shall provide information
as to the location of the proposed planned development; the uses and
approximate area of use category; a list of any and all exceptions to the
subdivision and zoning regulations of the village and any other information
necessary to clearly explain the planned development.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review and consider the
proposal as to its compatibility with the Comprehensive (Master) Plan and the
goals and policies for planning of the village and advise the applicant on the
information, documents, exhibits, drawings and limitations on the proposal that
should be included in the application to the village for a special use permit
for planned development.
   (B)   The applicant shall request the special use permit, by letter
addressed to the chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission, to be
placed on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the Planning and Zoning
Commission for a preliminary discussion of the proposed planned development,
and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the proposed planned
development at the meeting, which may be continued from time to time. The
applicant shall present such exhibits and written information as may be
necessary to fully acquaint the Planning and Zoning Commission with the
proposed development which shall include but not necessarily be limited to the
following:
      (1)   A tentative sketch plan, which may be in freehand sketch form,
showing the location and extent of the types of land uses proposed;

subdivision requirements being requested as part of the planned development
application.
   (C)   Within 30 days after final adjournment of the meeting, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall submit to the Village Board a report in writing
containing its recommendation.
   (D)   The formal petition for a planned development shall be addressed to
the Village Board and shall be filed with the Village Clerk. Ten copies of the
petition shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission. Attached to
each copy shall be copies of the supporting documents and exhibits hereinafter
provided for.
   (E)   The hearing date shall be set and the notice of the hearing shall be
published at least once, not more than 30 days or less than 15 days before the
hearing date in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the village.
   (F)   The petition shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and the report of such shall be submitted to the Village Board. The report of
the findings and recommendations shall be accompanied by such plans, exhibits
and agreements as shall have been presented by the petitioner, each identified
for reference by letter or number, together with any suggested changes therein.
   (G)   The Village Board may grant a special use for a planned development
which shall be by specific ordinance and which shall contain, or to which shall

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
§ 154.170 PURPOSE; GOALS; LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas in the
village.
   (B)   Goals.
      (1)   The goals of this subchapter are to:
         (a)   Protect land uses and property values by minimizing the
potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas;
         (b)   Protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents and
businesses of the village;
         (c)   Minimize the total number of towers necessary to serve the
community;
         (d)   Promote and encourage the shared use of tower sites as a primary
option, rather than construction of additional single-use structures;
         (e)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
         (f)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas and
accessory buildings by means of careful siting, design, landscape screening,
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
         (g)   Encourage the use of alternative, small cell distributed antenna
systems as a means to mitigate the aesthetic impact of personal wireless
telecommunications facilities in areas of special economic, historical or
architectural value to the village;
         (h)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently; and
         (i)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through sound and appropriate engineering and careful siting of tower
structures; and to require removal of such structures when they are no longer
used.
      (2)   In furtherance of these goals, the village shall give due
consideration to its Comprehensive Plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and
environmentally-sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers
and antennas.
   (C)   Legislative findings. The Village Board makes the following
legislative findings concerning the relationship these regulations have with
the village's general plarrning efforts:
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission has conducted several meetings
with public hearings on this subchapter and has reviewed appropriate areas for
towers and antennas in the village to minimize the impact.
      (2)   The Village Board generally adopts the findings and recommendations
of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (3)   The Village Board encourages the location of the towers and
antennas on properties owned by the village or other units of local government
when the setbacks and separation distances set forth in this subchapter can
generally be met.
   (D)   Interpretation.
      (1)   The provisions of this chapter are not intended to and shall not be
interpreted or applied so as to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this
chapter be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between
providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent
that any provision or provisions of this chapter are inconsistent or in
conflict with any provision of this subchapter, the provisions of this
subchapter shall be deemed to control.
      (2)   In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required
under this subchapter made by an applicant to provide personal wireless service
or to install personal wireless service facilities, the Village Board shall act
within a reasonable period of time after a complete request is duly filed with
the village, taking into account the nature and scope of the request. There
shall be a rebuttable presumption that a reasonable period of time to take
final action on applications for collocated facilities is 90 days and for new
facilities 150 days; provided that such period shall be tolled during any time
the applicant needs to respond to reasonable requests for additional
information. Any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
      (3)   No decision to deny an application for a conditional use permit or
a zoning variation for the construction or installation of a personal wireless
service facility may be based on the environmental effects of radio frequency
emissions to the extent that such facility complies with the FCC's regulations
concerning such emissions.
      (4)   Nothing herein shall be construed to release any applicant from
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local building, electrical
and occupational safety laws, regulations, codes and rules.

(Ord. 16-02, passed 2-22-2016)
§ 154.173 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Principal or accessory use. An antenna or tower may be considered
either a principal or an accessory use. On any lot, an existing use or
structure shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such
lot.
   (B)   State or federal requirements. 
      (1)   All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of
the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with
the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and
regulations are altered, changed, or modified after the date of approval by the
village, or construction by the owner, then the owner of any personal wireless
service facility governed by this section shall bring such personal wireless
service facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations
within six months after:
         (a)   The effective date of any such standards and regulations; or

      (1)   Towers either shall be constructed of and maintain a galvanized
steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, shall be
painted so as to reduce visual glare and obtrusiveness. The color of the tower
shall be designed to facilitate the appearance of the tower to blend with the
natural environment, subject to the approval of the Village Board.
      (2)   At a tower site, the design of the equipment building and/or
cabinet, and any related structures shall, to the extent possible, use
materials, colors, and/or textures that will blend them into the natural
setting and surrounding buildings; in addition, the village may require as a
condition for approval of the application for special use certain screening or
landscaping.
      (3)   If an antenna is installed on a base station, the antenna and
supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that
is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the base station so
as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible.
   (F)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views. Lighting is permitted during times which construction or
maintenance is being performed on a tower.
   (G)   Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower separation distances
shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in and around the village
irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries.
   (H)   Signs. No signs shall be allowed on any antenna or tower, except for
any safety warning or other sign required by applicable regulation and a sign
bearing the identity of the owner of the personal wireless service facility.

wireless service facilities, or sites which have been approved for personal
wireless service facilities, or for which applications or petitions for
approval for personal wireless service facilities have been filed, that are
either within the jurisdiction of the village or within one-quarter mile of the
border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and
design of each tower. The village may share such information with other
applicants applying for approvals or special use permits under this subchapter
or other persons or entities seeking to locate personal wireless service
facilities within the jurisdiction of the village; provided, however, that the
village is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or
warranting that such sites are available or suitable for location of a personal
wireless service facility. The purpose of requiring this information is to
facilitate and promote collocation of communication facilities.

   (C)   Applications for special use permits under this subchapter shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements of the zoning regulations in this
chapter; in particular, any specific regulations of the zoning district in
which the property on which the special use is to be located, except as
modified in this subchapter. In the event of a conflict, the more restrictive
regulation shall control.
   (D)   In granting a special use permit, the Zoning Board may recommend, and/
or the Board of Trustees may impose, conditions for approval to the extent the
village concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any unique adverse
effect of the proposed tower, any equipment building or cabinet, and other
facilities related to the tower, but such conditions may not have the effect of
prohibiting erection of a tower otherwise shown to be necessary at the proposed
location.
   (E)   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits,
whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed
professional engineer.
   (F)   Each applicant for special use shall file an application with the

village shall from time to time pay the costs incurred by the village for
reviewing the application, including fees incurred for any consultant to review
and report on the application. Any balance remaining on said deposit after
final decision of the application shall be refunded to the applicant. The
Village Board shall from time to time set a fee and required deposit amount for
such application.
   (G)   Towers.
      (1)   Information required. In addition to any information required for
applications for special use permits under the the zoning regulations in this
chapter, applicants for a special use permit for a tower shall submit the
following information.
      (2)   A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and height
of the proposed tower, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses and
zoning (including properties outside the village's boundaries), Comprehensive
Plan classification of the site and all properties within the applicable
separation distances set forth in this subchapter, adjacent roadways, proposed
means of access, setbacks from property lines and structures, elevation
drawings of the proposed facilities, topography, parking, and other information
deemed by the village to be reasonably necessary to assess compliance with this
subchapter.
      (3)   The setback distance between the proposed tower and each of the
following: the nearest residential unit; any residentially zoned property
(including any unplatted residentially zoned property); and any other property
planned for residential uses.
      (4)   A landscape plan showing specific landscape materials to be
incorporated into the screening required, if any.
      (5)   A description of the finished color and, if applicable, the method
of camouflage and illumination, including any fencing.
      (6)   A description of applicant's compliance with §
154.173(C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (I) and (K) and divisions (E) and (F) of
this section.
      (7)   A statement by the applicant as to whether construction of the

or base stations cannot be used to provide the service proposed by the new
tower.
      (9)   If the location is leased or to be leased to applicant, agreement
by the owner to terms relating to removal of the personal wireless service
facility and related facilities, as described in this section.
   (H)   Factors considered in granting special use permits for towers. In
addition to any standards for consideration of a special use permit application
pursuant to §
154.208 of this chapter, the Zoning Board and the Board of Trustees shall
consider the following factors in determining whether to recommend issuance of
a special use permit:
      (1)   Height of the proposed tower by comparison to the permitted height
in the relevant zoning district, and whether the application qualifies for a
height variance, if required;
      (2)   Whether uses on adjacent and nearby properties are particularly and
uniquely sensitive to the impacts from towers, and the facts which distinguish
the adjacent and nearby properties from other properties in the village;
      (3)   Whether topography of the land surrounding the proposed site of the
tower affects the perceived height of the tower and the utility of the tower;
      (4)   Whether tree coverage and foliage surrounding the proposed site of
the tower affects the applicant's ability to camouflage the tower;
      (5)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
      (6)   How the proposed ingress and egress to the proposed site of the
tower affects nearby traffic patterns and whether the surrounding highway
network is capable of supporting the vehicles used to install and service the
tower; and
      (7)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
distributed antenna systems, as discussed in division (I) of this section.
   (I)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the village that no existing
tower, base station or a distributed antenna system can accommodate the
applicant's proposed coverage requirements. An applicant shall submit
information requested by the village related to the availability of suitable
existing towers, other structures or distributed antenna systems. Evidence
submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, base station or distributed
antenna systems can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of
any of the following:
      (1)   There are no existing towers or base stations are located within
the geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
      (2)   Existing towers or base stations are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
      (3)   Existing towers or base stations do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
      (4)   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on existing towers or base stations, or the
antenna on the existing towers or base stations would cause such interference
with the applicant's proposed antenna.
      (5)   The fees, costs, or other contractual provisions for payment or
expense required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or base
station or to adapt an existing tower or base station for sharing are
unreasonable. Total fees, costs or other contractual provisions for payment or
expense which exceed the cost of developing and constructing a new tower are
presumed to be unreasonable.
      (6)   The applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and base stations
unsuitable.
      (7)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures, such as a distributed antenna
system, is unsuitable. It shall not be presumed that merely because costs of
alternative technology exceed the cost of developing a new personal wireless
service facility that the alternative technology is unsuitable.
   (J)   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 100% of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
      (2)   Guys and equipment buildings or cabinets must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements, including the provision of transitional
yards, if required.
   (K)   Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required:
      (1)   Separation from off-site uses/designated areas. Tower separation
shall be measured from the base of the tower to the lot line of the off-site
uses and/or designated areas as specified in Table 1, including the exceptions
noted therein.
      (2)   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the minimum
standards established in Table 1.
      (3)   Separation distances between towers shall be applicable for new
towers, and shall be measured as the distance between the proposed tower and
any preexisting towers. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing
or following a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the
proposed base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. The separation
distances (listed in linear feet) shall be as shown in Table 2.

   (L)   Security fencing/anti-climbing. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained in the zoning regulations in this chapter, a tower, and any
equipment building or cabinet related thereto, shall be enclosed by fencing for
security purposes. Said fencing shall be not less than six feet in height. The
tower shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; or shall
be designed to discourage climbing; provided however, that the Zoning Board may
recommend and the Board of Trustees may approve a waiver of such requirement as
it deems appropriate.
   (M)   Landscaping. In the event that landscaping is proposed by the
applicant or is otherwise required as a condition for approval of the special
use application, the following requirements shall govern:
      (1)   The standard landscape screen or buffer shall consist of a
landscaped buffer of evergreen trees at least six feet high outside the
perimeter of the facilities and/or any fence.
      (2)   In a location where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping standards may be reduced in the discretion of the
village.
      (3)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
   (N)   Recommendation; approval. The Zoning Board may recommend, and/or the
Board of Trustees may approve, a waiver or reduction of the burden of any one
or more of the criteria set forth in this subchapter, if either respectively
concludes that the purposes and goals of this subchapter would be better served
thereby; and specifically as to the setback requirement of this subchapter, may
reduce the standard if enforcement of the requirement would effectively
prohibit the proposed facilities.

§ 154.177 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   (A)   Any antenna or tower that is not used or operated for a continuous
period of 12 months, or which fails to comply with the requirements of §
154.173(B) or (C) shall be considered abandoned. However, before an antenna or
tower is considered abandoned, the Village Board shall provide the owner
thereof and the owner of the property upon which it is located with at least 45
days advance written notice of the reasons why the village has determined it is
abandoned, notice of the date and time of the meeting when the matter will be
considered and advise them that they will be given the opportunity to be heard
at the meeting.
   (B)   All abandoned or unused portions of a personal wireless service
facility shall be removed within six months of the Village Board's
determination that such facilities are abandoned, unless a time extension is
approved by the Village Board. Before the Village Board makes a finding or
issues an order for removal of the facility resulting from its abandonment, the
applicant and the owner shall be given an opportunity for a pre-deprivation
hearing in the manner described below:
      (1)   When the village believes all or any part of a facility has been
abandoned, the Village Clerk shall cause a notice of facility abandonment to be
sent via first class mail to the owner of the facility. The notice of facility
abandonment shall state the name and address of the owner, the name and address
of the property owner, a summary of the grounds for the village's determination
and describe the opportunity for a hearing. If the village does not have any
records identifying the owner of the facility, the village shall send notice to
the owner, as identified by the tax records of the Chief County Assessment
Officer.
      (2)   Failure to request a hearing within 21 days from the date of the
notice will result in the Village Board making its determination solely on the
basis of evidence presented by the village staff, agents and contractors.
      (3)   A person may challenge the validity of the notice of facility
abandonment by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to submit evidence
which would disprove abandonment, or the term for which the facility has not
been used or operated is less than 12 months. Upon a request for a hearing, the
Village Clerk shall schedule the hearing for a regular or special Village Board
meeting.
      (4)   All parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
testimony and evidence at the hearing. A request for a continuance of the
hearing date must be made in person before the Village Board and may be granted
upon a showing of good cause. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at
the hearing.
      (5)   Written notice of the Board's determination of abandonment shall be
sent via regular mail, and via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
owner of the personal wireless service facilities and the owner of the
property, as determined by reference to the records of the Chief County
Assessment Officer.
   (C)   The owner of any antenna or tower designated by the Village Board as
abandoned shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the
village.
   (D)   In order to guarantee said removal, the applicant for a building
permit for placement of personal wireless service facilities must post and

   (A)   Purpose. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine and vary
the regulations of this chapter in harmony with their general purpose and
intent, only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth, where the
Planning and Zoning Commission makes a finding of fact based upon the standards
hereinafter prescribed, that there are practical difficulties or particular
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of
the chapter.
   (B)   Application for variations. An application for a variation shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator on a prescribed form. The application shall
contain such information as the Planning and Zoning Commission may require. No
more than 90 days after the filing of the application, a hearing shall be held
on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be published at least once, not
more than 30 days or less than 15 days before the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the village.
   (C)   Standards of variations. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not
vary the regulations of this chapter, as authorized herein, unless it shall
make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case
that:
      (1)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the district in which it is located.
      (2)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances.
      (3)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
      (4)   For the purpose of implementing the above rules, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall also, in making its determination whether there are
practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the
extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been
established by the evidence:
         (a)   The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations are carried out.
         (b)   The conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based
would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning
classification.
         (c)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property.
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by the
owner of the property.
         (e)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
         (f)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood or adversely affect the health, morals or general welfare of the
public.
      (5)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in this section, to reduce or minimize the
injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and
better to carry out the general intent of this chapter.
   (D)   Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this chapter
shall be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission only in accordance with
the standards, as set forth in this subchapter and may be granted only in the
following instances, and in no others:
      (1)   To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback
required by the applicable regulations;
      (2)   To permit the use of a lot or lots not of record on the effective
date of this chapter for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of
insufficient area of width of the lot or lots, but in no event shall the
respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 90% of the required
area and width;
      (3)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of the
facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours of the
same days of the week;
      (4)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or off-street loading
facilities required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or 20%
of applicable regulations, whichever number is greater; or
      (5)   To increase by not more than 25% the maximum distance that required
parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served.
   (E)   Decisions. The concurring vote of the five members of the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall be necessary to approve a variation.

application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.

§ 155.01 CRITERIA FOR DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES OR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU
THEREOF.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a planned unit
development or the issuance of a building permit, each subdivider shall be
required to dedicate land for school purposes, make a cash contribution in lieu
of a land dedication, or a combination of both. The village shall determine
whether a land donation, cash donation or combination of both is required with
the concurrence of the school district. The donation shall be made in
accordance with the following criteria.
(Ord. 15-07, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 155.02 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION.
   (A)   Requirement and population ratio. 
      (1)   The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or
planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required to
be dedicated for school sites. The determination of the number of students to
be generated from a particular development or lot shall be based on data
published by the Illinois School Consulting Service, as set forth in the table
set forth in this section (hereinafter "Population Table").
      (2)   A BEDROOM, as used in this chapter, shall include any den, study,
or extra room located on any floor in a dwelling unit, which is not clearly
identified for some other specific purpose, other than a kitchen (one per
unit), dining room (one per unit), living room (one per unit), bathroom, and
family room (one per unit).
      (3)   In the event a subdivider files a written objection to the
Population Table, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned
unit development. The Population Table shall be used in calculating any cash in
lieu of land contribution herein, unless objected to as provided in this
chapter. Objections to the Population Table shall be made in accordance with
this chapter to the Village Board. Failure to object to the Population Table in
accordance with this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an
objection at a later time.

   (B)   School classification and size of school site. School classifications
and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance
with the "Acreage Per Student Table" set forth in this section. These
requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and
literature on the subject, including, but not limited to, information provided
by the State Superintendent of Education and the unique characteristics of
DeKalb County, including its generally rural character and its open spaces and
the desire of its residents to maintain this character and open space in their
future school sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the
appropriate acreage requirements
and shall be used in calculating any contribution herein, unless timely
objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for
any particular development shall be made in accordance with this chapter to the
Village Board. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in
accordance with of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an
objection at a later time.

   (C)   Land dedication requirement. The land dedication requirement shall be
determined by multiplying the estimated children to be served in each such
school classification calculated pursuant to the Population Table by the
appropriate number of acres per student contained in the Acreage Per Student
Table. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have
sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of
children in each such school classification.
   (D)   Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted
by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
(Ord. 15-07, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 155.03 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF SCHOOL SITES.
   (A)   Cash contribution. When the development is small and the resulting
site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate
for a school site, the village, with the concurrence of the affected school
district, shall require the subdivider to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
the land dedication.
   (B)   Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be
based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area that otherwise
would have been dedicated as a school site. The fair market value, on a per
acre basis, shall assume that the land is zoned residential, subdivided,
stubbed with village sewer and water, has all appropriate utilities available,
is improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential
development. Based upon a study of real estate transactions in DeKalb County
for the past three years, it has been determined that the present fair market
value of such improved land in and surrounding the village as of the effective
date of this chapter is $21,780 per acre. This figure shall be adjusted
annually by the Village Board based on real estate transactions and any other
indicators as to value. The fair market value, as defined above, shall be used
in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely
objected to as provided in of this chapter. Objections to the fair market
value, as defined above, shall be made in accordance with this chapter to the
Village Board. Failure to make timely objection to the fair market value, as
defined above, in accordance with this chapter shall thereafter waive any right
to raise an objection at a later time.
   (C)   Refund of cash contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in
lieu of school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth
herein 20 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the
subdivider who made such contributions.
(Ord. 15-07, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 155.04 USE OF CASH CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF SCHOOL SITE.
   If the school district determines in its sole discretion that the
acquisition of land is not economically feasible or necessary given the current
and anticipated needs of the school district, then the cash contribution in
lieu of school site donation shall be used for the purpose of constructing
school buildings and facilities necessary to educate the students generated by
the development.
(Ord. 15-07, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 155.05 OBJECTIONS.
   All objections relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair
market value, the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit set
forth in §
155.02, or any other application of this chapter to a particular lot,
subdivision or planned development, shall be referred to the Village Board for
hearing. An objection must be made, if at all, prior to the approval by the
village of the final plat of subdivision or planned unit development. Where a
plat of subdivision is not required, any objection must be made before the
issuance of any building permit. A failure to object by such time shall
constitute a waiver of the right to object to the provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Form of objection. All objections shall be in writing and at a minimum
contain the following information:
      (1)   Specific identification of the exact data, calculation or other
determination to which an objection is being made;
      (2)   A detailed written basis for each and every objection made with
specific reference to all data, written documentation and/or testimony on which
each and every objection is based;
      (3)   A specific detailed statement setting forth the proper data,
calculation or determination which the objector believes should be made under
this chapter with specific and detailed reference to any data, documentary
information and oral testimony supporting said position or belief;
      (4)   Copies of all data, and/or any other documentary evidence upon
which the objector intends to rely;
      (5)   Where any data is submitted the objection shall make a specific
reference as to the source of such data;
      (6)   Where any studies performed by or on the behalf of the objector or
any other source are submitted, the objector shall further submit detailed
information concerning the methods and procedures used in the study to collect
and analyze data;
      (7)   Where any documentary or other evidence upon which the objector
relies refers to other sources of information and/or back-up materials from
which data or information was gathered, the objector shall provide copies of
such back-up data and/or information;
      (8)   (a)   A certification swearing that the objector has served full
and complete copies of its objection upon the superintendent of the school
district serving the village. If personal service is used the certification
shall state:
            1.   The date upon which such personal service was made;
            2.   The home and business addresses of the individual making
personal service; and
            3.   The identity and description of the individual to whom service
was actually made.
         (b)   Where service is by certified mail return receipt requested the
certification shall state the day and place on which such mailing was deposited
with the U.S. post office and the name of the individual depositing same with
the U.S. post office.
      (9)   The legal and common description of the properties affected by the
objection.
   (B)   Waiver of objections not made. All objections shall contain every and
any objection being made. Any objections which are not specifically set forth
shall forever be deemed waived.
   (C)   Variances in the form of the objection. Where any objector believes
the information required to be contained in the objection creates an undue
hardship, the objector shall include with its objection a sworn certification
stating specific and detailed reasons why all the information required cannot
be supplied and all reasons why the objector believes that requiring this
information is an undue hardship.
   (D)   Procedure for making an objection. Ten copies of every objection shall
be served upon the Village Clerk. If the objection is served on the Village
Clerk ten or more business days before the next regularly scheduled Board
meeting, the objection shall be formerly presented to the Village Board at its
next regularly scheduled meeting. If the objection is served upon the Village
Clerk less than ten business days before the Board's next regularly scheduled
meeting, the objection shall be formerly presented to the Village Board at the
first regularly scheduled Village Board meeting which is ten or more days after
the date the objection is received by the Village Clerk. When the Village Clerk
receives an objection he or she shall notify the objector and the
superintendent of the school district of the date at which the objection shall
be formerly presented to the Village Board. The objector and/or the objector's
representative shall appear at the date scheduled for the presentment of the
objection to the Village Board. If service of the objection on the
superintendent of the district was made by certified mail, the objector shall
appear on said date and submit to the Board proof that the objection was in
fact received by the superintendent of the school district. The school
district, through its representative, shall also have the right to appear and
address the Village Board on the date the objection is formerly presented to
the Village Board. On the date the objection is formerly presented the Village
Board, the objector and any representatives from the school district shall set
a date for a hearing on the objection. If requested, the school district shall
be given at least 30 calendar days to review and develop information to be
presented at the hearing on the objection. If the school district believes
additional time is necessary, the school district shall request same at the
time the objection is formally presented to the Board. The Village Board shall
give the school district more than 30 days to develop information in
preparation for the hearing if the school district can show good cause for such
additional time. The factors to be considered in determining whether any school
district has shown good cause include but are not limited to:
      (1)   The length of the objection and the amount of supporting data
contained in it;
      (2)   Whether all back-up data studies and reports have been submitted
with the objection;
      (3)   The school district's need to undertake additional study or gather
additional information to present to the board at the hearing; and
      (4)   The complexity of the issues involved.
   (E)   Hearing. The hearing shall take place at a regularly scheduled Village
Board meeting or other special meeting duly noticed and called for said
purpose. The hearing shall take place on the date and time set by the Board.
The Village President shall preside over the hearing and render decisions on
any testimonial and/or evidentiary questions that arise with the advice of the
Village Attorney. The objector and the school district shall have the right to
be represented by counsel and the right to present oral and documentary
evidence to the Board. The objector and the school district shall have the
opportunity to cross-examine each other's witnesses. Any member of the Village
Board shall have the right to ask questions of any witness at any time. The
objector and the school district shall be provided the opportunity to present
rebuttal testimony and/or documentation. After the objector and the school
district have submitted their testimony and documentation, the Board shall give
interested members of the public the right to be heard. The Board shall have
the right to continue the hearing from time-to-time on its own motion or on the
request of the objector and/or the school district. The Board shall deliberate
in public and shall issue its written decision on each objection within 30 days
of the conclusion of the hearing. The Board may accept or reject the objector's
position in whole or in part. All costs of the hearing, including the Village
Attorney fees, court reporter fees, publication costs and the like shall be
paid by the objector. The village may require the objector to make an advanced
deposit to cover such fees and costs.
   (F)   Notice of hearing. At least once, not more than 20 nor less than 15
calendar days before the hearing shall the objector publish in one or more
newspapers published in the village, a notice setting forth the date, time and
place for the scheduled hearing on the objection. The notice shall identify the
nature of the objector's objection, the relief requested, identify the property
or properties involved by both legal and common descriptions and invite any
interested members of the public to attend. At the opening of the scheduled
hearing the objector shall initially furnish to the Village Board proof that it
has complied with the requirements of this division (F).
   (G)   Appeals. The decision of the Village Board shall be final. All appeals
of such decisions shall be on the record of the hearing before the Village
Board and in accordance with the Illinois Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS
5/3-101 et. seq. Appeals shall be filed within 35 days of the written decision
of the Village Board.
(Ord. 15-07, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 155.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Annexation. The dedication of land, cash contribution in lieu thereof
and donation of capital costs required by this chapter of a platted subdivision
shall also be required as a condition of the annexation of any land to the
village, and shall be incorporated in any annexation agreement governing such
land. However, the village reserves the right to negotiate dedications of land
or cash in lieu of land and other donations for other purposes which are
greater than those set forth herein.
   (B)   Indemnification. As a precondition to the school district's collection
of school site dedications, and cash in lieu of land donations and the school
district shall execute an agreement indemnifying the village and its elected
and appointed officials and holding each of them harmless from any damages and
costs which arise out of any challenge to the validity of this chapter.
   (C)   Schedule of donations.
      (1)   The cash in lieu of land contribution and capital cost donation
imposed by this chapter shall be made by a certified or cashier's check payable
directly to the applicable school district and held by the school district for
use as provided in this chapter.
      (2)   Fifty percent of any projected cash in lieu of land donation
imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable for each unit to be built
prior to final plat approval of the subdivision or final approval of a planned
unit development. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for each unit to
be built, the balance of all cash in lieu of land donations relating to that
unit shall be due and payable.
      (3)   In calculating the total amount of any cash in lieu of land
contribution imposed by this chapter, the village shall use the fair market
value of property in effect at the time of building permit issuance.
      (4)   (a)   For cash in lieu of land donations due and payable prior to
final plat approval of a subdivision or final approval of a planned unit
development, the school district shall issue a receipt showing:
            1.   Total projected cash in lieu of land donation;
            2.   The total projected capital cost donation; and
            3.   The amount of the projected cash in lieu of land donation
actually paid.
         (b)   For cash in lieu of land donations payable prior to the issuance
of any building permit, the school district shall issue a receipt for each lot
or unit, which shows that payment of the full cash in lieu of land donation has
been received. Each such receipt issued for donations received prior to the
issuance of building permits shall identify the name of the builder/developer
requesting the permit and specifically designate the subdivision and lot or
unit to which the donation is referred.
      (5)   At the time the first donation is made, the subdivider shall
provide to the school district a copy of the approved plat of subdivision or
other document showing all lots that are proposed to be developed. In the event
any amendments or changes are made to the approved plat of subdivision, the
subdivider shall submit a revised plat of subdivision identifying all lots and
showing all changes or revisions which have been made. The school district
shall use the plats of subdivision provided to mark off those lots for which
the full cash donation has been paid.
   (D)   Severability. If any provision of this chapter or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is declared invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such partial invalidity shall not affect the other
provisions or applications of this chapter, the invalid provision shall be
deemed stricken from this chapter as if it were not a part hereof, ab initio,
and the remainder of this chapter shall continue in full force and effect.
   (E)   Reservation of additional land. Where the Comprehensive Plan or
standards of the village call for a larger amount of land for a school site in
a particular subdivision or development than the subdivider is required by this
chapter to dedicate, the land needed in excess of the required dedication shall
be reserved by the subdivider for subsequent acquisition by the village or
other public body designated by the village, provided that such acquisition is
started within one year from the date of approval of the final plat.
   (F)   Combining with adjoining developments. School site dedications may be
combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions and developments in order
to produce usable school sites without hardship on a particular subdivider.
   (G)   Improved sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for
full service of electrical, water, sewer, and streets (including enclosed
drainage and curb and gutter), as applicable to the location of the site, and
shall otherwise comply with the requirements of the village's subdivision
regulations. At the discretion of the Village Board, the landscaping normally
included within the definition of "improved" sites under the village's
subdivision regulations may be omitted due to the delay time between dedication
of any such school site and the construction of school facilities thereon.
   (H)   Dedication at time of approval official plat. Approval of any final
plat of subdivision or any final planned unit development plat shall be
conditioned upon the dedication of land or cash donations in lieu thereof as
required by this chapter. Dedications of such land or cash in lieu thereof may
be made at such other time as is specifically approved by the Village Board.
   (I)   On-site storage. No storage of any equipment and/or material,
including spoil materials or topsoil, shall be permitted on any land designated
for park and recreational use or for school sites.
   (J)   Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of any
dedicated site, as well as its surroundings must be suitable for the building
of school facilities. Wetlands, floodplains, floodways and land that serves as
a component of any storm water control or retention system shall not be
acceptable land donations. Land burdened by highway or any other type of
easements or encroachment also shall not be an acceptable land donation.
