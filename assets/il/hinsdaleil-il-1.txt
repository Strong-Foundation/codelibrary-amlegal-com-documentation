Village Code amendments imposing a tax on motor fuel at a rate of three cents

open or closed meeting of the board of trustees.
   B.   Minutes of all meetings shall reflect if a trustee was physically
present or present by means of a video or audio conference. Lack of such a
specification shall be deemed to indicate that the trustee in question was
physically present.

participate in open or closed meetings by means of a video or audio conference.
Such electronic participation may only occur if the trustee is prevented from
physically attending by: 1) personal illness or disability; 2) employment
purposes; 3) business of the public body; 4) a family emergency; or 5) another
emergency. If a trustee wishes to attend a meeting electronically, the trustee
must notify the village clerk at least forty eight (48) hours before the
meeting, unless advance notice is impractical. Notification may be in person or
in writing, or by phone, e-mail or facsimile transmission. The notification
shall include a detailed recitation of the particular circumstances why the
trustee cannot attend, and also cite one of the five (5) above specified
categories. The notification also shall substantially follow the format laid
out in section

shall be considered, and is hereby designated, as the agent of the village
clerk. Notice given to the village clerk or deputy village clerk shall be
sufficient. Copies of the request shall be provided to all trustees promptly,
but in no event later than the meeting in question.
   D.   Upon receipt of notice of intent to participate electronically, the
village clerk, deputy village clerk or his/her designees shall make appropriate
arrangements for the trustee to participate electronically, such as by
arranging a speakerphone for the meeting room and obtaining contact
information. The equipment shall provide output sufficient for persons
attending the meeting, and members of the audience, to hear the trustee speak,
and also shall allow the trustee to hear other trustees and any person who
addresses the board of trustees.
   E.   The board of trustees allows electronic attendance for qualifying
reasons listed in the Illinois open meetings act, as a matter of policy. The
audio or video equipment shall be activated at the beginning of the meeting, or
at the time requested by the trustee, so that the trustee can participate.
   F.   If the trustee who is attending electronically would normally chair the
meeting, a president pro tempore who is physically present may be appointed.
   G.   When a trustee attends a meeting electronically, all votes shall be by
roll call vote. An electronically attending trustee must identify himself or
herself by name and be recognized by the president before speaking.
   H.   An approved request to participate electronically shall entitle the
trustee involved to attend at the subject meeting and any closed sessions
called during that meeting.
   I.   This section shall apply in like manner to any subsidiary committee,
subcommittee or other agency of the village that is a "public body" under the
Illinois open meetings act. (Ord. O2006-72, 10-3-2006)

chair shall vote thereon, unless excused by the board, or unless he be directly
interested in the question, in which case he shall not vote.

but these: 1) to adjourn; 2) to lay on the table; 3) for the previous question;
4) to postpone indefinitely; 5) to postpone to a certain time; 6) to commit; 7)

which he disapproves, he shall return to the board of trustees, with his
written objections, at the next regular meeting of the board of trustees
occurring not less than five (5) days after their passage. The village

resolution or motion making an appropriation, and if so, the remainder shall be
effective. However, the village president may disapprove entirely of an
ordinance, resolution or motion making an appropriation.

surety thereon, in such form and for the full amount of the contract sum or
price in order to ensure the faithful performance of the contract and an
observance of all ordinances of the village relating thereto. Said bond shall

within the corporate limits of the village, be subject to taxation under the
provisions of this section for such transactions as are or may become subject

in the operation of the taxpayer's business.

the following definitions shall apply:
      GROSS RECEIPTS: The consideration received for distributing, supplying,
furnishing or selling gas for use or consumption and not for resale, and the

material and for all services rendered therewith, and shall be determined
without any deduction on account of the cost of the service, product or
commodity supplied, the cost of materials used, labor or service cost, or any
other expenses whatsoever.
      PERSON: Any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership,
association, joint stock company, joint adventure, corporation, municipal
corporation or political subdivision of this state, or a receiver, trustee,
conservator or other representative appointed by order of any court.
      TAXPAYER: Any person engaged in the business of distributing, supplying,
furnishing, or selling gas or electricity for use or consumption within the
corporate limits of the village; or any person using or consuming electricity
acquired in a purchase at retail and used or consumed within the corporate
limits of the village.
   E.   Effective Date Of Taxes: Any amount of taxes due and payable for any
tax levied for any tax period prior to the effective date of this section shall
remain due and payable in the manner provided at such time for such taxes
regardless of the provisions of this section. The tax established in subsection
A1 of this section shall be based on the "gross receipts", as herein defined,
actually paid to the taxpayer for services billed on and after November 1,
1991.
   F.   Returns: The taxes authorized by this section shall be remitted by the
taxpayer to the village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to
the month in which a bill is issued by the taxpayer. Each taxpayer shall make a
return to the village treasurer for the previous month, stating the following:
      1.   The taxpayer's name;
      2.   The taxpayer's principal place of business;
      3.   The taxpayer's gross receipts or the kilowatt-hours used, as
applicable, during those months upon the basis of which the tax is imposed;

The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of making

provided, that in connection with any return the taxpayer may, if the taxpayer
so elects, report and pay an amount based upon its total billings of business
subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made (exclusive of
any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based
upon any differences between such billings and the taxable gross receipts or
the kilowatt-hours used, as applicable. Where a taxpayer's total tax owed to

the electricity to the purchaser and is recoverable at the same time and in the
same manner as the original charge for delivering the electricity. Any tax
required to be collected pursuant to subsection A1b of this section and any
such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt
owed to the village by such person delivering the electricity. With respect to
such debt owed to the village, the person delivering electricity shall be
allowed a credit against such debt to the extent the tax related to deliveries
of electricity is not collected because the charges for such electricity are
written off as uncollectible; provided that if such charges are thereafter
collected by the person delivering electricity, such person shall be obligated
to remit such tax to the village. Persons delivering electricity shall collect
the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for
delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be
authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to three percent (3%) of
the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the expense incurred
in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting
the tax and supplying data to the village upon request. If the person
delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the
purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the village in the
manner prescribed by the village. The person delivering electricity who files
returns pursuant to this section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay
the village the amount of the tax collected pursuant to subsection A2 of this
section.
   I.   Books And Records: Every taxpayer required to pay the tax imposed by
this section directly to the village shall keep accurate books and records of
its business or activity, including contemporaneous books and records denoting
the transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability
under this section. Subject to the applicable provisions of section
3-14-4 of this title, the books and records shall be subject to and available
for inspection by the village at all times during the business hours of the
day.
   J.   Violations; Penalty: Any taxpayer who fails to make a return, or who
makes a fraudulent return, or who violates any other provision of this section
shall be subject to the penalties provided in section
3-14-12 of this title.
   K.   Validity: In the event that public act 90-561 is declared
unconstitutional, or if any of the provisions of this section, amended by this
ordinance, are voided by court action, the previous provisions of this section
in effect at the time of passage of this ordinance shall remain in effect in
all respects as if such provisions had never been amended by this ordinance,
and any amounts paid to the village by any person delivering electricity
pursuant to this ordinance shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to
subsection A2 of this section as they existed prior to the passage date hereof.

      1.   The act or privilege of originating or receiving in the village
intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent (6%) of the
gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer by
such person. To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall
be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax. However, such tax is not imposed on such act or privilege to the
extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and statutes of
the United States, be made the subject of taxation by municipalities in the
state of Illinois.
      2.   The act or privilege of originating or receiving in the village
interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent (6%) of the
gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer by
such person. To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation of the act
or privilege that is subject to taxation under this section, any taxpayer, upon

state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant
to this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid
in such other state or such tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this
state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or
local tax in the state of Illinois. However, such tax is not imposed on the act
or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the
constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation
by municipalities in the state of Illinois. (Ord. O2009-12, 3-3-2009)
   C.   Collection Of Tax:
      1.   Collection By Retailers: The tax authorized by this section shall be
collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in
the state of Illinois and making or effectuating the sale at retail and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the village. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to this section and any such tax collected by such retailer shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the village. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the village. The tax authorized by this section shall
constitute a debt of the purchaser to the retailer who provides such taxable
services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as
the original charge for such taxable services. If the retailer fails to collect
the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax
directly to the village in the manner provided by the village.
      2.   Tax Returns: The tax authorized by this section shall be remitted by
a retailer to the village not later than the last day of the month subsequent
to the month in which a bill is issued to a taxpayer. Each retailer shall make
a return to the village treasurer, for the previous month, stating the
following:
         a.   Name of retailer;
         b.   Retailer's principal place of business;
         c.   Retailer's gross charge during the previous month, upon which the
tax is imposed;
         d.   Amount of the tax;
         e.   Such other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities or the village treasurer may require.
Where a retailer's total tax owed to the village averages less than twenty five
dollars ($25.00) per month in a calendar quarter, the retailer may request
permission from the village treasurer to file a return on a calendar quarter,
rather than a monthly, basis.
      3.   Payment Of Tax; Collection Commission: Retailers filing returns
pursuant to this section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay to the
village the amount of the tax imposed by this section, less a commission of
1.75 percent, which is allowed to reimburse the retailer for the expenses
incurred in keeping records, billing the customer, preparing and filing
returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon request. No
commission may be claimed by a retailer for tax not timely remitted to the
village.
      4.   Separate Item: Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this section
shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the
gross charge for telecommunications.
      5.   Credit For Erroneous Payment: If the retailer demonstrates, to the
satisfaction of the village treasurer, that an amount of tax has been paid that
was not due under the provisions of this section, whether as a result of a
mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against
any tax due, or to become due, under this section, from the retailer who made
the erroneous payment. However, no such claim may be made more than three (3)
years after the date of the erroneous payment.
   D.   Exemption For Reselling:
      1.   Application For Resale Number: If a person, who originates or
receives telecommunications in the village, claims to be a reseller of such
telecommunications, such person shall apply to the village for a resale number.
Such applicant shall state facts which will show the village why such applicant
is not liable for tax under this section on any of such purchases and shall
furnish such additional information as the village may reasonably require.
      2.   Issuance Of Resale Number: Upon approval of the application, the
village manager, or his designee, shall assign a resale number to the applicant
and shall certify such number to the applicant. The village manager, or his
designee, may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or
which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person having discontinued the making of resales.
      3.   Use Of Resale Number: Except as provided hereinabove in this
section, the act or privilege of sending or receiving telecommunications in
this state shall not be made tax free on the grounds of being a sale for resale
unless the person has an active resale number from the village and furnishes
that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that
any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.
   E.   Not A Replacement For Other Payments: The tax imposed by this section
shall be in addition to the payment of money, or value of products or services
furnished, to the village by the retailer or the taxpayer as compensation for
the use of its streets, alleys, or other public places, or installation and
maintenance therein, thereon, or thereunder of poles, wires, pipes, or other
equipment used in the operation of the retailer's or taxpayer's business.
   F.   Failure To Return Tax:
      1.   Any taxpayer who fails to make a return, or who makes a fraudulent
return, or who wilfully violates any other provision of this section shall be
subject to the penalties provided in section
3-14-12 of this title.
      2.   In addition to the fine above, such taxpayer shall be liable in a
civil action for the amount of tax due. (Ord. O2001-5, 2-6-2001, eff. 5-1-2001)

license. No additional license fee shall be payable for a new local liquor
license required by virtue of the occurrence of any of the events described in

3-3-27: FINE, SUSPENSION, REVOCATION, AND NONRENEWAL OF LOCAL LIQUOR LICENSE
GENERALLY; APPEAL:
   A.   Revocation, Suspension, And/Or Denial: The commissioner may, in
accordance with the state liquor control act, revoke, suspend, or deny the
renewal of any local liquor license issued under the provisions of this chapter
and/or levy a fine on the licensee if it is determined that the licensee has
violated any of the provisions of the state liquor control act, this chapter,
or any other ordinance or resolution enacted by the village, or any applicable
rules or regulations established by the commissioner or the Illinois liquor
control commission, or any state or federal statute. However, no such license
shall be revoked, suspended, or denied renewal, nor may a fine be levied except
after a public hearing by the commissioner upon three (3) business days'
written notice to the licensee affording the licensee an opportunity to appear
and defend the charges contained in such notice. The three (3) business days'
notice provisions shall begin the day following delivery of notice to the
licensee if delivered in person, or two (2) business days after such notice was
deposited in the U.S. mail, it being conclusively presumed that such licensee
shall have received such notice within two (2) business days after deposit in
the U.S. mail.
   B.   Emergency Authority: If the commissioner has reason to believe that any
continued operation of a particular licensed premises will immediately threaten
the welfare of the community, the commissioner may, upon the issuance of a
written order stating the reason for such conclusion and without notice or
hearing, order the licensed premises closed for not more than seven (7)
business days, giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard during that
period. If the licensee is also engaged in another business on the licensed
premises, such order shall not be applicable to such other businesses.
   The commissioner shall, within five (5) business days after such hearing, if
it is determined after such hearing that the local liquor license should be
revoked, suspended, or denied renewal, or that the licensee should be fined,
state the reason for such determination in a written order, including in such
order the amount of the fine, period of suspension, or that the license has
been revoked or denied renewal, and shall serve a copy of such order within the
five (5) business days upon the licensee by depositing the copy of such order
in the U.S. mail.
   C.   Appeal: Appeal of any decision of the commissioner shall be permitted
to the extent, and shall be conducted in the manner, provided for in section 7-
9 of the state liquor control act. Appeal of any decision of the commissioner
regarding the nonrenewal of a license shall only be allowed if required by law,
otherwise such decision of the commissioner shall be final and nonreviewable.
All appeals from decisions of the commissioner shall be limited to a review of
the official record of proceedings of the commissioner as provided for in
Section 7-9 of the State Liquor Control Act. Within five (5) days after the
notice of an appeal has been filed with the State Liquor Control Commission, a
certified official record of the proceedings for the commissioner shall be
filed with the State of Illinois Liquor Control Commission; provided, however,
that the appellant licensee pays for the cost of the transcript as provided by
section 7-9 of the State Liquor Control Act.

days of notification of the costs by the commissioner. In the event of an
appeal to the Illinois liquor control commission, and in cases where appeal is
taken pursuant to the administrative review act, payment is due ten (10)
business days after the entry of an order finally affirming the determination
of the commissioner. Failure to pay said costs within ten (10) business days of
notification is a violation of this section and may be cause for local liquor
license suspension or revocation. In the event a local liquor license is
revoked, the licensee shall forfeit all sums therefor paid to the village in
connection with such local liquor license.
   D.   Nonlicensee Fines: Any person, partnership, corporation, limited
liability company, that is not a licensee, violating any provision of this
chapter shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more

the licensee shall be fined an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for a first violation within a twelve (12) month period, one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for a second violation within a
twelve (12) month period, and two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for
a third or subsequent violation within a twelve (12) month period. Not more

offense shall be deemed committed on or during each day during which a

indicating that the insurance company will insure the solicitor and the
business or organization represented by the solicitor against any injury to any
person or property during the solicitation that is causally related to an act

disclosure application shall not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or
penalty for any period before the date the application was filed; provided,

late payment, then the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of five percent (5%) of the
tax due and not timely paid or remitted. Late filing and payment penalties
shall not apply to a particular taxpayer if, but only if, a failure to file
penalty is imposed on that taxpayer by the village. The village tax

that the late filing or late payment was due to a reasonable cause and abate
some or all of the penalty.

for noncompliance with the provisions of a village tax only in the event that

provision relating to a village tax shall be subject to the general penalty
provisions of this code and, in addition, shall be liable in a civil action for
the full amount of the tax due plus the applicable amount of interest. (Ord.

of any property or place on which graffiti has been placed, while also a
victim, must be required to remove that graffiti for his or her own good and
for the protection of the safety, health, and welfare of all residents of the
Village. The purpose of this Section is to prevent the propagation of graffiti

possible, with the objective of protecting the public safety, health, and
welfare.

ordinance, or regulation.

property or place to the condition it was in immediately prior to the placement
of such graffiti.
   I.   Special Village Remedies: In addition to every other remedy provided by
law for any violation of this section, the village, not sooner than ten (10)
days after service of the notice provided in subsection F of this section and
if the owner or other person on whom such notice was served fails to remove the
graffiti described in the notice, may take all such steps as the village
determines are necessary to remove, cover, or otherwise eradicate the graffiti,
including, without limitation, prosecution of an action for an injunction
requiring such owner or other person to remove the graffiti within a time
period determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   All costs incurred by the village in taking any action pursuant to this
subsection shall be borne by such owner or other person. If such owner or other
person fails to reimburse the village for such costs within thirty (30) days
after the village mails an invoice for such costs to such owner or other
person, then, to the extent authorized by law, such costs shall become a lien
on the subject property and the village may perfect such lien with the DuPage

as may be authorized by law and necessary to foreclose and collect on such

person. (Ord., 6-5-1973)

the offender to appear in court at the time designated for hearing such cases.
Such officer may sign a complaint for the issuance of a warrant if the offender
does not appear at the time and place so specified. (Ord., 6-5-1973)

   A.   Whenever an officer witnesses a violation of any ordinance relating to
vehicular standing, equipment, parking or compliance 1 , the officer may, in
lieu of filing of a complaint in court, issue a citation to the alleged
violator:
      1.   Advising the person that he/she has violated a specified ordinance;
      2.   Requesting the person to make payment in an amount applicable to the
violation as set forth in section
6-11-5 of this chapter as settlement of the violation claim; and
      3.   Informing the person that: a) upon failure to so settle, a complaint
will be filed in the circuit court, charging the person with the violation; and
b) that the person may appear at the police department in person within ten
(10) days to request that the citation be converted into a court complaint.
The officer shall immediately attach the ticket to the illegally stopped,
standing, or parked vehicle in a place clearly visible to the driver of the
vehicle. If the driver is present, the officer may deliver the ticket directly
to the driver. The fact that a vehicle is registered in the name of a person
shall be considered prima facie evidence that the person was in control of the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   B.   The word "officer" in this section includes all police officers and
other designated agents of the village designated by the village manager. The
citation may be referred to as a "P ticket".

violation claim by paying the village the applicable amount as shown in the
schedule set forth in section
6-11-5 of this chapter within a period specified in the citation. In the
alternative, within ten (10) days of the date of the issuance of the citation,
the violator may appear in person at the village police department and request
that the citation be converted for a court appearance. The village police
department will then rewrite the ticket on a circuit court form and assign it
to the next available regular traffic key date of the issuing officer, and the
citation will be transmitted to the circuit court. A court complaint filed
after a failure to settle shall seek a fine no greater than the amount required
to settle the violation at the time the complaint was filed.
   D.   The payment shall be made in accordance with the instructions contained
in the citation. The staff person processing the payment will issue a receipt
and promptly remit the amount to the village treasurer to be credited to the
proper municipal fund. If transmitted by mail, payment shall be deemed to be
received on the date of the postmark.
   E.   If the violator fails to seek to convert the citation to a court
appearance and fails to settle and pay the violation claim within the
prescribed time under section
6-11-5 of this chapter, then the officer is authorized to cause a notice to
appear to be served upon the violator and is authorized to file a complaint and
to prosecute the complaint in the circuit court. (Ord. O2006-38, 6-6-2006)

place the registration number of the eligible vehicle on the vehicle
immobilization list.

immobilization hearing not later than five (5) days after receipt of a request

eligible vehicle. Such evidence shall include evidence that establishes the

immobilization was based or any other violation of any Village ordinance
relating to the eligible vehicle.
      5.   Decision: Based on the hearing record, the Police Chief shall issue
a written decision: a) affirming the validity of the notice of pending
immobilization and confirming that the subject vehicle is an eligible vehicle
subject to immobilization pursuant to this Chapter, or b) revoking the notice
of pending immobilization. The Police Chief shall deliver a copy of his or her
decision to the registered owner within forty eight (48) hours after the
conclusion of the pre-immobilization hearing. The decision of the Police Chief
on a pre-immobilization appeal shall be final.
      6.   Action if Affirmation: If the Police Chief affirms the validity of
the notice of pending immobilization and confirms that the subject vehicle is
an eligible vehicle subject to immobilization pursuant to this Chapter, then
the Police Chief shall place the eligible vehicle's registration number on the

not be placed on the vehicle immobilization list if, within three (3) days
after receipt of the Police Chief's decision, the registered owner of the
eligible vehicle pays or causes to be paid to the Village all fines and
penalties on all outstanding parking citations lodged against the eligible
vehicle, including specifically but without limitation the parking citations
identified in the notice of pending immobilization.

pursuant to this Chapter without further notice. (12-13-94)
6-16-5: IMMOBILIZING RESTRAINT:

chief of police's designee determines that there is probable cause to believe
that the vehicle was used as hereinabove provided in section
6-17-2 of this chapter, he or she shall order the continued impoundment of the
vehicle, unless the owner of the vehicle posts a cash bond with the village in
the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), and pays the towing and storage
costs to the applicable tow company.
   D.   If the chief of police or the chief of police's designee determines

record of the vehicle without any fees or other costs, but the owner of record
shall be responsible to pay any towing or storage charges to the applicable tow

of the hearing. The plea hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer,
designated by the village manager. The owner of record shall appear at a plea
hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is
entered, the cause shall be disposed of at that time. If the owner of record

officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and
give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at
the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible.
   B.   Owner Of Record Responsibility: If, after the hearing, the Hearing
Officer determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the vehicle was
used in connection with a violation set forth in section
6-17-2 of this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the Village for an
administrative fee in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), and require
the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative
fee to the Village, plus applicable towing and storage costs to the applicable
tow company. The five hundred dollar ($500.00) administrative fee shall be a
debt due to the Village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to section
6-17-4 of this chapter, the bond shall be applied to the administrative fee. If
the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
enter a default order in favor of the Village, which order shall require the
payment to the Village of the five hundred dollar ($500.00) administrative fee
and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company, and the continued
impoundment of the vehicle until the owner pays to the Village the five hundred
dollar ($500.00) administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the

occurred, the Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's
vehicle without any fee or other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously been
posted, the cash bond shall be returned, but the owner of record shall be
responsible for any towing or storage charges to the applicable tow company.

facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in the citation,
and the burden of proof shall be upon the defendant to prove that the violation
was not committed. (Ord. O2008-45, 8-12-2008)

authority under section 11-208.7 of the Illinois Vehicle Code 1 , in the
seizure and impoundment of a motor vehicle, the Village shall be liable to the
owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle for the cost of storage fees and
reasonable attorneys' fees. (Ord. O2017-09, 3-7-2017)

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the
village's rights of way and the village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this article, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Article: This article applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this article may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this article.
   E.   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this article and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Titles, Chapters And Articles: This article
supersedes all titles, chapters and articles or parts of titles, articles and
chapters of this code adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to
the extent of such conflict, and if there is no conflict, such other titles,
articles and chapters of this code shall govern.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
article or other applicable articles and chapters of this code, the utility
shall comply with the requirements of this article or other articles and
chapters of this code to the maximum extent possible without violating federal
or state laws or regulations.
   H.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this article and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this article when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-2007)

By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
article by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-2007)
7-1G-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this article;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
article; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the village manager, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village manager
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-
6-2007)

particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of terrain features visible to the
right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it does
not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
   I.   Tree Prohibition: No trees shall be removed as a result of the
construction, installation, maintenance, repair or replacement of any
facilities, whether such work is done pursuant to a franchise, license or
permit, without the prior written approval of the Village. In the event that
trees are approved for removal, they shall be replaced by one or more trees
with a total diameter at breast height (dbh) that is not less than the total
dbh of the trees being removed. The replacement trees shall each be not less
than three inches (3") dbh, of species approved by the Village, and planted at
locations approved by the Village. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-2007)

Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

utility facilities within the rights of way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or
upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights of way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;

determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-2007)
7-1G-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village manager or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
village police shall be notified immediately.

a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The village manager may authorize
a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the village manager may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this article but which carries out the purposes of
this article.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village
manager under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to
the village board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the village clerk
within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The village board shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7)
days after the filing of the appeal. The village board shall timely decide the
appeal. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-2007)
7-1G-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-
2007)
7-1G-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this article.

Notes
  1. Demolition permits in the Robbins Park Historic District are subject to a
1 separate fee necessary to defray all additional staff, attorney, and other
  costs and expenses associated with the reviews and procedures associated with
  such demolitions, as detailed in Title 14 of this code.
9-1-5: PUBLIC PROPERTY DAMAGE ESCROW AND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Cash Escrow Required; Purposes: It shall be unlawful for any person to
commence any excavation or construction work in the Village for which a Village
permit is required (the "work") unless the owner, general contractor, or other
person doing such work (collectively and severally referred to as the
"principal"), first shall have deposited in escrow with the Village cash or a
letter of credit (the "escrow") in the amount hereinafter specified. The escrow
shall be held by the Village for the purposes of:
      1.   Indemnifying the Village against any damage done by the principal,
by any subcontractor of the principal or by the work to any Village property,
structure, equipment, or facility; and
      2.   When the work includes the making of any excavation, ensuring that
the excavation portion of the work will be completed within six (6) months
after the date of its commencement and ensuring that all portions of the
excavation not occupied by structures completed as of that date will be
refilled and ensuring that the surface will be restored to its original
condition by that date.
   B.   Amount Of Escrow: The principal shall deposit with the Village, for the
escrow, an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the work value or five hundred
dollars ($500.00), whichever is more, provided, however, that the required
escrow shall not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). The Building
Commissioner shall have the discretion to require additional escrow above ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) where the Village Engineer determines that there
is likelihood that the cost of restoration of public streets or ways shall
exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) due to the work. All letters of credit
shall be in a form satisfactory to the Village Attorney, and the right to draw
on any such letter of credit shall be subject to no condition other than the
Village's submission of its written statement stating that: 1) the Village has
determined that a drawing is necessary to satisfy an indemnity obligation
arising under this section or 2) the letter of credit will expire in less than
thirty (30) days and has not been renewed. (Ord. O2009-42, 8-11-2009)
   C.   Duration Of Escrow: The escrow shall be held by the Village for the
purposes stated in subsection A of this section until the work is fully
completed and a certificate of occupancy or other final approval for the work
has been issued; provided, however, that the escrow may be held for up to
twenty four (24) months after such date in any case where the Village Manager
determines that damage caused or threatened by the work may not be fully
manifested or known by such date.
   D.   Village Claims Against Escrow:
      1.   Village Right To Draw On Escrow: On a determination by the Village
Building Commissioner of damage to any Village property, structure, equipment,
or facility as described in subsection A1 of this section or of failure to
complete the work or to make such restoration as described in subsection A2 of
this section, the Village may, subject to the provisions of subsection D2 of
this section, take all necessary actions to repair, or to cause the repair of,
such damage, or to make, or to cause to be made, such restoration and may draw
on any part of or all of any escrow for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith.
      2.   Notice; Hearing; Determination: Except in cases of imminent threat
of injury to persons or damage to property, no action pursuant to subsection D1
of this section shall be taken by the Village except after notice to the
principal served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested,
five (5) days in advance thereof. In case of such imminent threat, the Village
may act immediately as necessary to eliminate such threat and shall give the
notice herein required as soon thereafter as reasonably possible. Where more
than one person constitutes the principal, notice to the person or persons that
signed the building or other permit application shall be sufficient. Such
notice shall describe generally the damage to be repaired or the restoration to
be completed and shall advise the principal of the right to a hearing as
provided in this subsection D2 to contest the principal's responsibility for
such damage or restoration. The principal shall have five (5) days after
receipt of such notice to request, in writing, a hearing before the village
manager or his designee. On such request, the village manager or his designee
shall conduct an informal hearing designed to obtain all relevant information
and shall make a written determination thereon and provide a copy of such
determination to the principal personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested. If no request by the principal for a hearing is received by the
village, or if the village manager or his designee determines after conducting
a hearing that the village has the right to take action pursuant to subsection
D1 of this section, and if the principal has not, either within the time
provided for requesting such hearing or within five (5) days after receiving
the determination of such hearing, either taken the necessary action or entered
into a binding agreement satisfactory to the village manager to take such
action with all deliberate speed, then the village may proceed to take action
pursuant to subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-2008)
   E.   Other Remedies:
      1.   Street Openings: In the case of any damage to any village property,
structure, equipment, or facility as described in subsection A1 of this section
by any principal which has deposited a cash bond pursuant to subsection B of
this section, the principal: a) shall not be permitted to undertake any
additional street openings in the village, or to be issued a permit therefor,
until all necessary repairs and restoration are completed and all costs and
expenses in connection therewith paid by that principal and b) shall, for a
period of three (3) years after completion of such repairs or restoration,
deposit with the village, for the escrow, cash in the amount of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each street opening.
      2.   General: The village may, in addition to drawing on the escrow
pursuant to subsection D of this section and in addition to the remedies in
subsection E1 of this section, take any and all additional actions that may be
available to enforce all applicable provisions of this code and to recover any
damages done by the principal or by any subcontractor of the principal or by
the work. The escrow provided herein is in addition to any other such actions
and shall not be construed as a limit on the amount of damages that may be
recovered by the village or any other person or on any other remedy or penalty
provided by this code or otherwise by law. (Ord. O2009-33, 5-19-2009)
   F.   Replenishment Of Escrow: Any amount withdrawn from the escrow pursuant
to this section shall be replenished by the principal within ten (10) days
following such withdrawal. The failure of the principal to so replenish the
escrow shall be a violation of this code and grounds for revocation of any
permit or approval authorizing the work and for issuance of an order stopping
the work.
   G.   Return Of Escrow; No Interest: Provided that no notice given pursuant
to subsection D2 of this section remains unresolved, any amount remaining in
any escrow as of the date specified in subsection C of this section shall be
returned to the principal from which it was received within thirty (30) days
after such date. No interest shall be paid on any escrow.
   H.   Permit Condition: Every permit authorizing any work shall be deemed to
be conditioned upon the principal's acceptance of, and agreement to abide by,
the provisions of this section. Commencement of the work pursuant to any such
permit shall be deemed to be the principal's acknowledgment and acceptance of
such condition whether or not such condition is expressly stated on such
permit.
   I.   Escrows Under Prior Ordinances: The amount of any escrow established
pursuant to this section as it existed prior to the effective date of this
section shall be adjusted to the amount required by this section and as
adjusted, shall be held pursuant to the terms of this section. (Ord. O2008-46,
8-12-2008)
   J.   Insurance: No permit shall be issued unless the principal has filed
with the building commissioner an insurance certificate evidencing a valid
comprehensive general liability insurance policy, with an insurance company
approved by the village, which holds the village harmless for personal injury
and property damage coverage that may result or accrue from or become of the
making, existence or manner of work performed pursuant to said permit. Said
certificate shall show the village as party to the insured in an amount not
less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for each occurrence. (Ord. O2009-
33, 5-19-2009; amd. Ord. O2015-51, 12-8-2015)
9-1-6: ENFORCEMENT OF PROVISIONS:
It shall be the duty of the building commissioner and any lawfully appointed
deputies to enforce the provisions of this title. The building commissioner is
hereby empowered to make such inspections, examinations, and tests as may be
necessary to see to the enforcement of these provisions.
A reinspection fee shall be charged for each time, after the village building
department has been notified that a building or structure or other work is
ready for said inspections, examinations, or tests as required, that the
Building Department, for reason that either the property owner or contractor
was not on the job site or the job in fact was not ready for the called
inspection, was unable to make the inspection. This fee must be paid prior to
the final inspection, approval, or occupancy of the building or structure.
(Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-2008)
9-1-7: STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL WORK:
The following standards and conditions shall apply to all work undertaken in
the Village pursuant to a permit issued under this title:

whether demolition work or construction work, for which a permit is required
under this title.
      2.   Application Of Section

   B.   Permit Time Limits, Extensions And Exceptions:
      1.   Permit Term: Except as otherwise authorized by this subsection, no
permit or approval made pursuant to this title shall be valid for a period of
more than one year after the date of issuance.
      2.   Ninety-Day Administrative Extension: The Director of Community
Development may, upon receipt of a completed application for a ninety (90) day
administrative extension, and payment of the applicable additional fees, issue,
for good cause shown, a ninety (90) day administrative permit extension at
fifty percent (50%) of the original base permit fee. Notice of the extension
shall be provided, at the applicant's sole cost, within seven (7) days of its
approval via certified mail to all taxpayers of record of properties within two
hundred fifty feet (250') of the boundary of the property that is subject to
the application at the addresses listed with the applicable County Treasurer

for a complex-project- permit term exception is considered, the Board of
Trustees shall, after input from the applicant and any other interested

scope and complexity of a particular project, the applicant cannot reasonably
be expected to complete the project within the usual permit term, regardless of
whether extensions are issued. The Board of Trustees may, upon making such a
determination, and upon receipt of a completion schedule furnished by the
applicant, approve a duration for permits in excess of twenty four (24) months
on a case by case basis at two hundred percent (200%) of base fees. (Ord.

property, within sixty (60) days after completion of demolition, to a safe,
clean condition until construction of a new structure has commenced, including,
without limitation, backfilling of any excavation, grading, seeding, fencing,

in conformance with the requirements of the Village's stormwater management
ordinance, and shall include a certification by the applicant, in a form
provided by the Village, that all requirements of the Village's codes,

unreasonably divert or detain surface water onto adjacent properties or the
public rights-of-way; alter existing drainage patterns so as to adversely
impact adjacent properties or the public rights-of-way; increase or concentrate
runoff of stormwater onto adjacent properties or the public rights-of-way; or
cause some similar adverse impact, and, the applicant fails to submit proposed
measures that would eliminate the identified adverse impacts, the request for a

   D.   Other Application Requirements: Every application for a permit shall
include all of the following elements:
      1.   IEPA Approval: If the application includes demolition of a principal
structure and if the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (the "IEPA") has
promulgated regulations applicable to such demolitions, then the application
shall include a certificate or letter of approval of the proposed work by the
IEPA or a letter from the IEPA stating that IEPA approval is not required.
      2.   Certificate Of Insurance: If the application requires the issuance
of a stormwater management permit pursuant to section
12-1-5 of this Code and if the application proposes a building addition of six
hundred (600) square feet or more, then the application shall include a
certificate of insurance establishing that the applicant has general liability
insurance coverage for all damage to persons or property, including public
property and private property, that may result from the proposed work on the
subject property by the applicant or any of its employees, agents, contractors,
or subcontractors. Such insurance coverage shall be in the amount of not less
than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence. Such certificate of
insurance shall provide that such insurance coverage shall be maintained during
the entire time that work is being performed on the subject property pursuant
to the building permit.
   E.   Variations: No person shall cause or allow any variation from the
approved plans and specifications for any work unless amended plans and
specifications showing all proposed variations are first filed with the Village
and approved by the Building Commissioner. If any variation involves an
increase in the total cost of the proposed work, then a statement to that
effect shall be made and all necessary additional fees shall be paid before any
approvals are made.
   F.   Fencing: If the permit authorizes demolition or construction of a
principal structure or detached garage, or includes construction that will add
six hundred (600) square feet or more of gross floor area to a principal
structure, the applicant shall cause the subject property to be secured with a
six foot (6') high chainlink security fence to be installed around the
perimeter of the subject property in a location and manner approved by the
Building Commissioner. The fencing shall be installed not more than seven (7)
days nor less than four (4) days before commencement of any work on the subject
property pursuant to any permit issued under this section or section
9-1-7-1 of this chapter. In addition to such perimeter fencing, the applicant
shall cause a safety fence to be installed around every tree in the parkway
abutting the subject property. Such tree fencing shall be located, so far as
feasible, at the drip line of the tree, whether on public or private property;
provided, however, that this subsection shall not be construed or applied to
authorize placement of tree fencing on private property not owned by the
applicant unless proper permission therefor has been secured from the property
owner by the applicant. If placement of tree fencing is not feasible at the
drip line of the tree, then such fencing shall be installed in a location
approved by the building commissioner. In all cases, said safety fencing shall
be neutral in color. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-2008)
   G.   Prosecution Of Work: After work pursuant to a permit issued under this
title has commenced, such work shall be diligently and continuously prosecuted
until its completion and final approval of it by the village. Projects
receiving a permit will be required to submit an updated completion schedule
and/or progress update to the director of community development at three (3)
month intervals until project completion. Lack of diligent and continuous
progress toward completion as determined by the village through either
inspections or written updates will result in permit expiration. Notice of a
permit expiration shall be given to the permittee in writing by the village.
Permit determinations under this subsection may be appealed to the zoning board
of appeals. Once a permit has terminated pursuant to this subsection, the
permittee may only reactivate the permit upon payment of one hundred percent
(100%) of base fees. In no case shall the term of any reactivated permit, plus
any applied for and approved extensions (excluding a hardship extension), be
approved for a duration longer than eighteen (18) months from the date of the
original permit issuance. (Ord. O2014-15, 5-6-2014)
   H.   Site Management Standards: The following site management standards
shall apply to all work:
      1.   Accessibility, Parking And Loading Standards: No pavement or
sidewalk within any public right of way shall be unavailable for public use at
any time except when such pavement or sidewalk is removed and replaced. No such
pavement or sidewalk that is removed and replaced shall be out of service for
more than three (3) days. No parking, loading, or storage of demolition debris,
soil, or construction materials shall be permitted within any right of way, on
any public property, or within ten feet (10') of any right of way or adjacent
public or private property unless specifically approved by the village and
shown on approved accessibility plans as required by subsection C4 of this
section. The village may forbid parking in any particular location on a public
right of way if the village determines that such parking has an adverse impact
on neighboring property or on traffic control. All uses of vehicles shall
comply with sections
6-4-6,
6-6-1, and
7-1-11 of this code related to parking and operation of vehicles.
      2.   Particulate Control: Airborne particles shall be controlled at the
subject property at all times during work by thoroughly saturating all portions

9-1-7-2: PERSONAL VISITS TO NEIGHBORS BY PERMIT APPLICANTS:
   A.   Applicability: Personal visits to abutting neighbors are required by
any property owner who seeks a permit pursuant to section

line of the subject property or that is separated from the subject property
only by an alley (the "abutting owner").

undertake to make one personal visit to each abutting owner. The applicant must
make at least two (2) attempts to complete each required personal visit. Each
attempt must be made at a time when it is reasonable that the abutting owner
will be present. All personal visits must be made only after the applicant's
application for a building permit has been submitted to the village for review.
      If there is no answer by the abutting owner on the first attempt to make
a personal visit, then the applicant must leave a letter, in a standard form
provided by the village, stating that a project is proposed, that the applicant
is trying to make personal contact, that the applicant will stop back again,
and that the abutting owner may call the applicant to set a time for the visit.
      If there is no answer on the second attempt, then the applicant must
leave a second standard letter and a standard village information packet
stating that the second attempt was made, that the abutting owner may call the
applicant or the village for information about the proposed work, and that
plans related to the work are available for review at the village hall.
   D.   Scope Of Visit: During a personal visit, the applicant must show the
abutting owner a copy of the proposed site plan and the tree preservation plan
for the project. The applicant must explain to the abutting owner, in general
terms, the scope of the work, the timetable for the work, any special measures
such as those being made to protect property, and other matters that may be
relevant to the abutting owner. The applicant also must provide the abutting
owner with a village prepared packet of information including, among any other
things, a summary of construction regulations and procedures.
      The purpose of a personal visit is not to secure any form of approval
from the abutting owner, but instead to assure that the abutting owner has had
an opportunity to learn, in general terms, about the proposed project.
   E.   Record Of Visit: The applicant must file with the village, prior to
issuance of any permit for work on the subject property, a standard "personal
visit completion form" that states that the applicant successfully completed
the required abutting owner personal visits. If one or more of the personal
visits could not be completed, then the applicant must state on the personal
visit completion form that he or she properly attempted to make the visits,
when the attempts were made, why the attempts were unsuccessful, and that he or
she properly left the required letters.
   F.   Condition Precedent To Building Permit: The filing of the personal
visit completion form is a condition precedent to issuance by the village of a
permit for work on the subject property.

provisions of this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the
demolition notice provisions of section
9-1-7-1 of this chapter. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-2008)

public works, or other official authorized by the board of trustees. Upon
issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease. Any
person who shall continue any work after having been served with a stop work
order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a
violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject to the penalties as prescribed
in this code. If a stop order is made orally, then a written stop order shall
be issued by the village as soon as practicable after the oral stop order is
made.

the administrative removal fee.
      2.   In the event of a supervisory deficiency at a construction site as
defined in subsection A of this section, a stop order shall be removed not less
than five (5) days after it was issued and only after correction of all
violations throughout the construction site, demonstration in writing to the
building commissioner of implementation of proper site management techniques,
and payment of the administrative removal fee.
   E.   Administrative Removal Fee: No stop order shall be removed, and no work
on the construction site subject to such stop order shall be continued or
commenced, until after payment of an administrative removal fee in the amount
of five hundred dollars ($500.00). The administrative removal fee shall be in
addition to every other fee, fine, or penalty imposed by this title or any
provision of this code. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-2008)
9-1-8-1: REVOCATION OF PERMITS:

No certificate of use and occupancy for any building or structure erected,
altered, or repaired after the adoption of this title shall be issued unless
such building or structure was erected, repaired, or altered in compliance with
the provisions of this title.
When no building permit has been issued and only a change of occupancy or new
occupancy at each location or unit is required, each application for such
occupancy received by the Village shall be accompanied by an occupancy permit
fee. Additionally, no tenant shall occupy a space, nor shall any owner permit a
tenant to occupy a space until that tenant has obtained a Certificate of
Occupancy and is in good standing with the Village.

within forty five (45) days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed a recommendation to deny the appeal.

any front yard or any corner side yard.
      3.   No "solid fence", as defined herein, shall be permitted that exceeds
twenty four inches (24") in height as measured from the natural grade in any
front yard or any corner side yard. A "solid fence" is a fence in which the
open spaces, when viewed at a right angle to the vertical fence plane,
constitute less than one-third (1/3) of the total fence contour. The "total
fence contour" is the entire square foot area within and between the outside

requirements relate to chainlink fences; provided, however, that under no
circumstances shall any fence be permitted under this subsection on a lot zoned
in the residence districts of the Hinsdale zoning ordinance which is used for
residential purposes except in conformance with all the requirements of this
section. The zoning board of appeals shall approve such petition only upon the
finding that: 1) the fence is justified in light of the seriousness of the risk
posed to the safety of persons and the fence will mitigate that risk; 2) the
fence will not alter the essential character of the locality; 3) the fence will
be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this section; 4) the fence
will set no unfavorable precedent either to the locality or to the village as a
whole; 5) the fence will be the minimum size and type necessary to accomplish
its intended purpose; and 6) the fence will not adversely affect the public
safety and general welfare.
   J.   Variations: Other than for variations to subsections E1f and E1g, any
person may petition to the zoning board of appeals for a variation from the

fence is placed, any structures on said lot, and all adjacent properties;
existing elevations in the area in which the fence is placed and any proposed
grade changes in said area; and such additional information as the plan
commission or zoning board of appeals may require.
      2.   The zoning board of appeals shall grant a variation from the
provisions of this section other than for variations to subsections E1f and E1g
only upon finding that: a) the petitioner is affected by unique circumstances
which create a hardship justifying relief from the provisions of this section,
b) the variation will not alter the essential character of the locality, c) the
variation will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
section, d) the variation will set no unfavorable precedent either to the
locality or to the village as a whole, 5) the variation will be the minimum
necessary to afford relief to the petitioner, and 6) the variation will not
adversely affect the public safety and general welfare. Every grant of a
variation shall be based on written findings of fact evidencing compliance with
the foregoing standards and specifying the reasons for granting the variation.
      3.   The plan commission shall recommend, and the board of trustees shall
grant, a variation from the provisions of subsections E1f and E1g only upon
finding that: a) the petitioner is affected by unique circumstances justifying
relief from the provisions of this section, b) the variation will not alter the
essential character of the locality, c) the variation will be in harmony with
the general purpose and intent of this section, d) the variation will set no
unfavorable precedent either to the locality or to the village as a whole, e)
the variation will be the minimum necessary to afford relief to the petitioner,

Plan. Street right-of-way widths shall not be less than the following
dimensions: (Ord., 2-3-1976)
 
Freeways      250 feet to 400 feet
Expressways   125 feet to 175 feet
Arterials     100 feet
Local streets 66 feet
              36 feet radius where cul-de-sacs are created on existing streets
Cul-de-sacs   with a 66 foot right of way. In all other cases, a cul-de-sac
              shall require a 40 foot radius
Alleys        25 feet
 
(Ord., 2-3-1976; amd. Ord., 3-7-1978)
   Where existing rights of way of abutting streets are greater than above
standards, then such existing right- of-way widths may be used.
   B.   Easements: Where no alleys are provided, easements for the installation
and maintenance of all overhead or underground utility services including
electric, telephone, gas, water and sewage services, shall be dedicated upon
the subdivision plat. Said easements shall be not less than ten feet (10') in
width and shall be centered on the rear lot lines as far as possible, or in
such other locations as the enforcing officer and the Plan Commission may
approve, and shall be so laid out as to provide continuity of such public
utility services from block to block.
   C.   Setback Lines: For all subdivisions, setback lines, if any, shall
conform to the rules and regulations of the Village's Zoning Ordinance.
   D.   Block Sizes: In all subdivisions, blocks shall not be more than one
thousand two hundred feet (1,200') long nor less than two hundred fifty feet
(250') wide. (Ord., 2-3-1976)
   E.   Zoning Regulations: The proposed subdivision shall conform to all
applicable requirements of the Hinsdale zoning code, including, without
limitation, the regulations related to minimum lot areas and dimensions. (Ord.,
4-25-1989)
   F.   Large Lots Or Tracts: Any owner wishing to subdivide the property into
lots or tracks of an exceptionally large size shall plat the same in such
manner that any future streets that may be anticipated can be laid out along
lot lines. The Plan Commission may reserve the right to require easements for
such streets to be shown and dedicated on such subdivision. (Ord., 2-3-1976)
   G.   Land Dedication And Contribution Standards:
      1.   General Requirement:
         a.   Condition Of Subdivision Approval: As a condition of approval of
a final plat for any subdivision that is located, entirely or in part, within a
residential district or that is, or is intended to be, used, entirely or in
part, for residential purposes, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate
land for park and recreational purposes to serve the immediate and future needs
of the residents of the proposed subdivision, or to provide a cash contribution
in lieu of actual land dedication, or to provide a combination of land and cash
contributions, at the option of the Village, in accordance with this subsection
G; provided, however, that no land dedication or cash contribution in lieu
thereof shall be required for the first fifteen (15) persons of any net
increase in ultimate population in any subdivision as calculated pursuant to
this subsection G. Land shall not be artificially subdivided so as to avoid
dedication of the full amount of land or payment of the full cash contribution
in lieu of land dedication otherwise required pursuant to this subsection G.
         b.   Aggregation Of Multiple Subdivisions: Two (2) or more
subdivisions that are represented by their subdividers to be separate
subdivisions shall be aggregated and treated as a single subdivision under this
subsection G when they are determined to be part of a unified plan of
development and are physically proximate to each other. Two (2) or more
subdivisions shall be treated as a unified plan of development if one or more
of the following standards apply:
            (1)   Common Ownership Or Control: Two (2) or more of the following
standards are met:
               (A)   The same person or persons has retained or shared control
of the land in the subdivision within a period of twenty (20) years prior to
the date of submission of an application for subdivision approval but not
including any period prior to January 1, 1999;
               (B)   The same person or persons has ownership or a significant
legal, beneficial or equitable interest in the land in the subdivision or in
the development within a period of twenty (20) years prior to the date of
submission of an application for subdivision approval but not including any
period prior to January 1, 1999; or
               (C)   There is common management of the subdivisions controlling
the form of physical development or disposition of parcels in the development.
            (2)   Closeness In Time Of Development: A reasonable closeness in
time between the completion of eighty percent (80%) or less of one subdivision
and the submission to the Village or other entity with jurisdiction of a
tentative subdivision plan or application for zoning relief for the other
subdivision or subdivisions.
            (3)   Shared Infrastructure: The sharing of infrastructure between
or among the subdivisions, such as streets, sidewalks, sanitary sewers, water
mains, or storm sewers and drainage systems.
            (4)   Common Sales Efforts: A common advertising scheme or
promotional plan is used for the subdivisions sought to be aggregated.
         c.   Condition Of Occupancy Permit: No occupancy permit shall be
issued for any structure on the land in the subdivision until such conveyance
or contribution has been acknowledged and received by the Village Manager.
      2.   Density Formula:
         a.   Population Table: The Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per
Dwelling Unit, set forth in this Section as Table 11-1, shall be used as
provided in this subsection G to calculate the required dedication of land for
park and recreational purposes or for cash contributions in lieu thereof,
unless a written objection thereto is filed by the subdivider with the Village
Manager pursuant to subsection G2c of this Section.
TABLE 11-1 1 Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit    Total
Persons Per Dwelling Unit
Type of Unit Total Persons Per Dwelling Unit
Type of Unit                     Total Persons Per Dwelling Unit
Single-Family Detached Dwellings 3.8

2 Bedrooms                       1.9
3 Bedrooms or more               3.1
 
   Note: The determination of the number of bedrooms contained in a building
shall be made by the Village Manager. Rooms designated by a subdivider as
"den", "library", "study", "sewing room", "exercise room", or the like may be
designated by the Village Manager as bedrooms if they are suitable for such
accommodations.
         b.   Presumed Density Formula: In applying Table 11-1 of this Section
to a proposed subdivision for which the types of units and number of bedrooms
cannot reasonably be determined from the data and materials on file with the
Village, the following types of units and bedroom data shall be used, unless a
written objection thereto is filed by the subdivider with the village manager
pursuant to subsection G2c of this section:
 
                                         Equal mix of 2 and 3 bedroom units at
Single-family attached:                  maximum unit density permitted by
                                         applicable zoning.
Multiple-family dwellings in the R-5 and Equal mix of 2 and 3 bedroom units at
R-6 districts:                           maximum unit density permitted by
                                         applicable zoning.
 
         c.   Objection To Density Formulas: If the subdivider files a written
objection with the village manager to the use of table 11-1 of this section or
the presumed density formula set forth in subsection G2b of this section, the
subdivider shall submit, at the subdivider's sole cost and expense, a thorough
and comprehensive demographic study showing the estimated population to be
generated by the proposed subdivision. The village board shall make the final
determination as to the density formula and estimated population that shall
apply to the proposed subdivision, which final decision shall be based on the
demographic study submitted by the subdivider and all other facts and
circumstances relevant to the issue as determined and required by the village
board. Nothing in this subsection G2c shall be construed as limiting or
preventing the village board from utilizing table 11-1 of this section or the
presumed density formula set forth in subsection G2b of this section for any
proposed subdivision. (Ord. O99-19, 4-20-1999)
      3.   Criteria For Park Land Dedication:
         a.   Calculation Of Land Required To Be Dedicated: The amount of land
required to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes for a proposed
subdivision shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of
that subdivision. The requirement shall be based on a standard of fifteen (15)
acres of land per one thousand (1,000) net increase in ultimate population,
computed in accordance with subsection G2 and table 11-1 of this section. (Ord.
O2004-55, 11-16-2004)
         b.   Location Of Land To Be Dedicated: The location of the land to be
dedicated for park and recreational purposes for the proposed subdivision
pursuant to this subsection G shall be determined by the village board after
receipt of a recommendation by the plan commission. The determination shall be
based on such factors as the plan commission and the village board shall deem
appropriate, including specifically, but without limitation, the availability
of land, the suitability of any particular land for park and recreational
purposes as opposed to use for other development, the location of the land
relative to population concentrations, and the proximity of the land to other
park or recreational lands.
         c.   Minimum Size Of Dedicated Land: The minimum size of any land to
be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be ten thousand (10,000)
square feet in area and no dimension shall be less than one hundred feet
(100'); provided, however, that the plan commission may recommend and the
village board may approve dedications of a smaller size or dimension when
required by the specific plans of the proposed subdivision and when the
usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is clearly
demonstrated. Nothing in this subsection G3c shall require the dedication of
any land in excess of the amount otherwise required by subsection G3a of this
section.
         d.   On Site Storage Prohibited: No materials or equipment, including,
without limitation, topsoil or other soil materials, shall be stored on any
land that has been dedicated, or that has been designated for dedication, to
the village for park or recreational purposes pursuant to this subsection G
without the express prior written consent of the village.
         e.   Detention And Retention Areas Not Qualified: No storm water
detention or retention area shall qualify as land suitable for dedication for
park and recreational purposes, unless the suitability of such land for park
and recreational purposes as a secondary use is clearly demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the village board.
         f.   Private Common Open Space And Recreational Areas:
            (1)   When private open space is made permanently available for use
on an equal and common basis to every resident in the proposed subdivision at a
proportionate share of the cost of maintenance, and such open space is
specifically intended and designed to meet the recreational needs of the
subdivision and is depicted on the final plat for the proposed subdivision and
recorded against the subject property ("private common open space"), then a one
hundred percent (100%) credit toward the park land dedication requirement of
this subsection shall be allowed to the extent of such private common open
space.
            (2)   If the total acreage of private common open space for the
proposed subdivision equals the total acreage required to be dedicated for park
and recreational purposes pursuant to this subsection, then such requirement
shall be deemed to have been fulfilled by the provision of such private common
open space.
            (3)   If the private common open space for the proposed subdivision
is not adequately or property maintained, at any time, to the satisfaction of
the Village Board, or if such private common open space is not made available
for use on an equal and common basis to every resident in the subdivision at a
proportionate share of the cost of maintenance, or ceases to be made so
available for use on such basis, then the private common open space shall be
dedicated by the owner to the public for public park and recreational purposes
upon direction by the Village Board, in the form of a resolution or ordinance
duly adopted, that such a dedication be made.
            (4)   Prior to approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall
prepare and record covenants establishing the provisions of this subsection
G3f, which covenants shall be duly executed by all owners of the land and all
mortgage holders, if any, and delivered to the Village for recording. Each such
covenant shall recite that it shall be enforceable by suit in equity brought by
the Village, its successors, if any, or by any interested person.
      4.   Criteria For Payment In Lieu Of Land Dedication:
         a.   General Qualification: In the event that a proposed subdivision
is small and the resulting required land dedication is too small, in the
determination of the Village Board, to be practical, or when the Village Board
finds that the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational
purposes, then the Village shall have the authority to require the subdivider
to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the otherwise required land dedications,
in accordance with the standards of this subsection G4.
         b.   Definition Of Fair-Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu
of land shall be based on the fair-market value of the acres of land in the
proposed subdivision, which fair-market value shall be determined by an
appraiser hired by the Village. The Village's expenses related to the hiring of
an appraiser for the purposes of determining the fair-market value shall be
reimbursed to the Village by the subdivider.
         c.   Objection To Fair-Market Value Determination: If the subdivider
or any other affected person files a written objection with the Village Manager
to the fair-market value as established pursuant to subsection G4b of this
Section, the subdivider or other affected person shall submit, at his or her
sole cost and expense, a written appraisal professionally prepared by a Member
of the Appraisal Institute of America (MAI). The appraisal shall show the fair
market value of improved land in the area of the proposed subdivision. The
Village Board shall make the final determination as to the fair market value of
such improved land, which final determination shall be based on the appraisal
or other information submitted by the subdivider or other affected person
involved, and any response thereto filed by the subdivider or other affected
person, and all other facts and circumstances relevant to the issue as
determined and required by the Village Board. Nothing in this subsection G4c
shall be construed as limiting or preventing the Village Board from utilizing
the fair-market value as established in subsection G4b of this Section for any
proposed subdivision.
         d.   Disposition Of Cash Contributions:
            (1)   Cash contributions in lieu of park land dedications shall be
held in trust by the Village, or other public body designated by the Village,
solely for use in the acquisition or development of park and recreational land
to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of the proposed
subdivision or for the improvement of other existing local park and
recreational sites.
            (2)   Funds held in trust shall be kept separate from all other
funds and shall be accounted for in the appropriate manner.
         e.   Refund Of Cash Contributions: If any portion of a cash
contribution in lieu of a park land dedication is not expended for the purposes
set forth herein within seven (7) years after the date of receipt of such
contribution by the Village, then that cash contribution shall be refunded to
the subdivider who made such contribution, or its successor or assign.
      5.   Criteria For Combination Land Dedication And Cash Payment: A
combination of land dedication and cash contribution in lieu of land dedication
may be required when appropriate as determined by the Village Board, including,
without limitation, in the following two (2) circumstances:
         a.   Inadequate Land: The proposed subdivision has some but not enough
adequate land to meet the dedication requirements of this subsection. That
portion of the land within the proposed subdivision that is adequate for park
land shall be dedicated as provided in this subsection, and a cash contribution
shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be
dedicated pursuant to this subsection.
         b.   Previous Acquisition: A major part of the local park or
recreational site already has been acquired and only a small parcel of land is
needed from the proposed subdivision to complete the site. Such parcel shall be
acquired by dedication, and a cash contribution shall be required for any
additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this
subsection.
      6.   Reservation Of Additional Land: When the Village's Official
Comprehensive Plan or other applicable standard of the Village requires a
larger amount of park and recreational land in a particular subdivision than
the subdivider is otherwise required to dedicate pursuant to the terms of this
subsection, then the land needed in excess of the otherwise required dedication
shall be reserved by the subdivider for subsequent purchase by the Village or
other public body designated by the Village, provided that such acquisition is
started within one year after the date of approval of the final plat for the
proposed subdivision.
      7.   Combining With Adjoining Subdivisions: For proposed subdivisions of
forty (40) acres or less, the otherwise applicable park and recreational land
dedication may be combined, where practical as determined by the Village Board,
with dedications for the same purposes from adjoining subdivisions or
developments to produce usable park or recreational areas.
      8.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography, and geology of a site
to be dedicated pursuant to the requirements of this subsection, as well as its
surroundings, shall be suitable for the intended purpose of the site. Grading
on dedicated land shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. No removal of
existing topsoil shall be permitted.
      9.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready
for full service of electrical, telecommunications, gas, water, sewer and
streets (including curb and gutter and enclosed drainage), as applicable to the
location of the site, or acceptable provisions shall be made therefor.
      10.   Dedication Required As Part Of Annexation Agreement: Unless waived
by the Village Board in its sole and absolute discretion, the dedication of
land, or cash contributions in lieu thereof, required by this subsection also
shall be required as a condition of the annexation of any land to the Village
for residential purposes. However, the same shall not be required as condition
to an amendment of an annexation agreement unless the Village Board finds from
a consideration of the purposes of this subsection that such dedications or
payments should be required because of increased burdens to be placed on the
park system over and above those covered by the dedications and cash
contributions made or provided for in connection with the original annexation
agreement. If the Village Board does so find, then additional dedications or
cash contributions shall be required, but only to the extent necessary to cover
the shortage resulting from such increased burdens. Dedications of land or cash
contributions in lieu thereof as specified in any annexation agreement that
substantially comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be deemed
to have fulfilled the dedication requirements of this subsection.
      11.   Dedication At Time Of Approval Of Final Plat: Approval of any final
plat of subdivision shall be conditioned on the dedication of land, or cash
donations in lieu thereof, as required by this subsection. When a subdivision
is to be developed over a period of years, dedication of required land may be
made after completion of a portion of the subdivision provided that an escrow
fund satisfactory to the Village has been established to guarantee the
conveyance of land after completion of such portion of the subdivision.
      12.   Title To Dedicated Park Land:
         a.   General Requirement: All sites to be dedicated pursuant to this
subsection shall be conveyed to the Village either by warranty or trustee's
deed, or such form of conveyance as the Village shall require. The subdivider
shall be responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of
conveyance, including any agricultural rollback taxes that might be extended or
levied against such sites. In the discretion of the Village, a commitment for
title insurance issued by a company authorized to do business in Illinois may
be required as evidence of clear title.
         b.   Park Land: Conveyance of park land dedications shall occur only
after or simultaneously with the passage of an ordinance or resolution by the
Village, in which it indicates that the land will be accepted by the Village,
for park purposes.
   H.   Lands Designated For Public Use: In addition to any lands required to
be dedicated or reserved pursuant to subsection G of this Section, all
subdividers may be required to set aside a certain portion of land to be used
for public purpose. The Village Board shall proceed to acquire the land so
designated by purchase, or commence proceedings to acquire by condemnation
within one year from the date of approval of the subdivision plat. If the
Village Board fails to act within the one year period, the land designated for
public use may then be used by the owners in any other manner consistent with
this Plan. (Ord. O99-19, 4-20-1999)

   D.   Street Name Signs: The Village will order and install one street sign
at all new intersections created by such subdivision. The subdivider shall
reimburse the Village for all expenses associated with the above.
   E.   Water Supply: The water system of the Village shall be extended
throughout or adjacent to the entire subdivision by the subdivider, at his own
expense, in such a manner that every lot in such subdivision may be serviced by
means of a service connection from water mains within the frontage or side
yards of each lot. The water system must be a looped system providing two (2)
independent sources of water service. The water system shall be built in
accordance with the Village's Standard Specifications for Water Main
Installation, the current edition.
   F.   Sanitary Sewers: The subdivider shall, at his own expense, install a
complete system of sanitary sewers throughout or adjacent to the subdivision in
such a manner as to render same accessible to every lot within its own

11-1-14: INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Appointment of Inspector: If, in the opinion of the enforcing officer,
it is necessary to have the public improvement required herein under more or
less continuous inspection and supervision and requiring services beyond the
normal duties of Village employees, he may appoint a qualified person as an
inspector.
   B.   Payment of Inspection Fees: It shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider to pay the actual cost of said inspector's compensation including
said inspector's direct salary and fringe benefits.
   C.   Method of Payment: In the event that an inspector is appointed, the
enforcing officer shall require the subdivider, prior to starting any
improvements requiring inspection, to pay to the Village Collector a sum which
the enforcing officer estimates will cover the costs of said inspection. In the
event the amount originally paid is not sufficient, the subdivider shall pay
the additional amount required to finish the work; or if the amount originally
paid is more than required, the surplus shall be returned to the subdivider
without interest. (2-3-76)
11-1-15: VARIATIONS:
The Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may approve one or
more variations from the requirements of Sections
11-1-7,
11-1-10,
11-1-11,
11-1-12, and
11-1-13 of this Chapter for a plat of subdivision; provided, however, that no
such variation shall be granted by the Board of Trustees that would detract
from or adversely affect the general plan, intent, or spirit of this Chapter or
of any building or zoning regulations applicable to the property that is the
subject of such plat of subdivision. Any such recommendation by the Plan
Commission shall be made in writing and be transmitted to the Board of Trustees

   A.   Approval by Plan Commission: After approval of a final subdivision plat
by the Plan Commission, the certificate thereon denoting said approval and date
thereof shall be signed by the chairman of the Plan Commission and attested by
the secretary. The secretary shall then transmit the approved final plat to the
Village Board together with a document of transmittal calling the Board's
attention to all variations (if any) approved by the Plan Commission and
setting forth its reasons for approving said variations and conveying to the
Board such other information concerning the subdivision as the Plan Commission
may deem necessary or advisable. With the approved final plat, the secretary of
the Plan Commission shall also transmit to the Village Board the subdivider's
agreement with respect to improvements, the approval of the enforcing officer
of all said improvements, together with plans, specifications, estimates and
escrow agreements, and all other documents, certificates and papers pertaining
to the final plat and the subdivision platted thereon; except that the Village
Board may waive the requirement as to receiving documents at that time
pertaining to proposed improvements as specified immediately above and approve
the final plat without said documents; provided, that all such required
documents shall be delivered to the enforcing officer before the final plat is
recorded. (2-3-76)
   B.   Approval by Board of Trustees: When the Board of Trustees is satisfied
with the final plat and with all proposed improvements, conditions, and
documents as submitted pertaining to the subdivision platted therein, the Board
of Trustees shall approve the final plat and authorize and direct the Village
President and the Village Clerk to sign the "approved" certificate on the final
plat, including the date of such signature, and to affix the Village Seal
thereto. The Board of Trustees' approval of the final plat may be subject to
appropriate conditions that must be fulfilled prior to the recording of the
final plat, such as, without limitation, submission by the subdivider of cash
as required by Section
11-1-11 of this Code to ensure the proper installation of all public
improvements attendant to the subdivision. Before the Village Clerk shall sign
or affix the Village Seal to the final plat, the subdivider shall fulfill all
conditions imposed by the Board of Trustees on the approval of the final plat
and, in addition, shall pay to the Village Clerk the fee of twenty dollars
($20.00) for each of the first five (5) lots platted on the final plat and five
dollars ($5.00) for each lot in excess of five (5) lots, but in no event shall
the total fee be less than fifty dollars ($50.00). Such fee shall be in
addition to the recording fees required pursuant to subsection C of this
Section.
   C.   Recording of Plat; Fees; Time Limit: The Village Clerk shall retain
each approved final plat until the subdivider has 1) fulfilled all conditions
imposed by the Board of Trustees on the approval of the final plat, and 2)
submitted to the Village cash to ensure the proper installation of all public
improvements attendant to the subdivision as required by Section
11-1-11 of this Title, and 3) deposited all escrow funds, inspection fees, and
other materials and documents that may be required with the final plat, and 4)
paid the fee provided in subsection B of this Section, and 5) paid to the
Village Clerk a sum estimated by the Village Clerk to be the cost of recording
the final plat. The Village Clerk shall cause the final plat to be recorded,
but only after all such requirements have been fulfilled. The original final
plat shall be retained permanently in the Village's files. No final plat
approval shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless all conditions
attached to such final plat approval have been fulfilled and the final plat has
been recorded. (3-15-94)
   D.   Conflict of Jurisdiction: The Plan Commission claims full jurisdiction
over platting of subdivisions and improvements thereon on all subdivisions
outside the Village limits, except as modified herein, within the boundaries
described in section 10 of the Plan. However, in the matter of water supply and
sewage disposal for individual lots or subdivisions as a whole where it is not
feasible to supply such lots or subdivisions with water or sewage service from
existing public water or sewage systems, the said Plan Commission waives
jurisdiction over such water and sewer installations in favor of control of
same by the county in which located. The enforcing officer shall notify the
proper county authorities in such circumstances. (2-3-76)

   A.   In the event that the Village shall grant to a company a nonexclusive
franchise to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct a cable
communications system within the franchise area, or a renewal of an existing
franchise, said franchise or renewal shall constitute both a right and an
obligation to provide the services of a cable communications system as required
by the provisions of this Chapter and the franchise agreement. The franchise
agreement shall include those provisions of the company's application for
franchise or application for renewal that are finally negotiated and accepted
by the Village and the company.
   B.   Any franchise granted under the terms and conditions contained herein
shall be consistent with Federal and State laws and regulations.
   C.   Any franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general provisions
of this Chapter now in effect or hereafter made effective. Nothing in the
franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the Village regarding
permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction.
   D.   The company shall acknowledge that its rights under this Chapter and
the franchise are subject to the police power of the Village to adopt and
enforce generally applicable ordinances necessary to the health, safety and
welfare of the public; and the company shall agree to comply with all generally
applicable laws and ordinances enacted by the Village pursuant to such power.
(Ord. O2000-20, 6-20-2000, eff. 7-1-2000)
13-5-5: REQUIREMENT OF A FRANCHISE:
No person shall construct, install, maintain, or operate a cable system within
the Village, or within any public ways of the Village, unless a franchise has
first been obtained pursuant to this Chapter, and unless such franchise is in
full force and effect. Such franchise shall not take the place of any other
license or permit which may be legally required of the company in order to
conduct such a business, or to construct or install buildings, structures,
facilities, or equipment within the Village. (Ord. O2000-20, 6-20-2000, eff. 7-
1-2000)
13-5-6: FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE; LIMITING NUMBER OF FRANCHISES:
   A.   Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The Village may grant any
number of franchises subject to applicable Federal and State law. The Village
may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily
limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local
considerations such as:
      1.   The capacity of the public ways to accommodate multiple cables in
addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as
electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.
      2.   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights of way.
   B.   In the event the Village grants an additional franchise to use and
occupy the public ways for the purpose of operating a cable system, said
additional franchise should only be granted under the same terms and conditions
as those imposed on the company previously granted a franchise pursuant to this
Chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to avoid the Village's receipt
of redundant or outdated equipment, to the extent that the company previously
granted such a franchise has provided specific equipment in satisfaction of its
obligation to support public, educational or governmental programming, the
Village may require the subsequent franchisee to provide alternative equipment,
providing that the total financial commitment for said equipment is equal to
that provided by the previously granted franchise. (Ord. O2000-20, 6-20-2000,

by the Village and the company of a franchise agreement subject to the terms

pursued by the company to remedy the substantial breach or default, the Village
shall schedule a public hearing to hear and determine the issues and to
consider whether sufficient cause exists to revoke the franchise. The Village

submitted and is being actively and diligently pursued, and whether cause
exists to revoke the franchise. The company shall be given an opportunity to be
heard in connection with those issues. If the Corporate Authorities are
persuaded that a substantial breach or default has occurred, the Corporate
Authorities shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the
substantial breach or default, as reflected by the following factors, in
considering whether some lesser sanction or cure, if any, should be imposed:

revoke the franchise, it may by ordinance declare the company's franchise to be

additional period of time to remedy the substantial breach or default before

facilities shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the
same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of
structure. Each consolidated application shall provide all the information
required by this chapter for each small wireless facility at each location. If
such an application includes incomplete information for one or more small
wireless facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless
facilities that do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are
otherwise denied, the Village may remove such collocation requests from the
application and treat them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued
for each collocation approved in a consolidated application.
   K.   Alternate Locations: If an applicant is seeking to install a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole as part of its
application, the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be
located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure
within two hundred (200) feet of the proposed collocation. Where an existing
utility pole is proposed for collocation, the entity owning the utility pole
shall provide access for that purpose, and the fee charged to the applicant
shall be the lowest rate charged by the entity for other wireless providers and
shall not exceed the entity’s actual costs, as required by Section 11-80-24 of
the Act. The applicant shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as
it has the right to use the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless
the alternate location imposes technical limits or additional material costs as
determined by the applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location
based on the foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence
in the form of a written certification, under oath, describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate
location from being utilized.
   L.   Exemptions: No application, permit approval or fee shall be required
from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the right-of-way
when the work in question is for:
      1.   Routine maintenance not requiring replacement of wireless facilities
if the wireless provider notifies the Village in writing at least forty eight
(48) hours prior to the planned maintenance;
      2.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that
are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider
notifies the Village in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications, including (i) equipment type
and model numbers, for the replacement of equipment consistent with the
equipment specifications information required on a permit application for
original installation; and (ii) information sufficient to establish that the
replacement is substantially similar. To the extent commercially available,
technologically compatible with the local network system, and already used in
its national or regional wireless network system, the wireless provider is
required to, when replacing such small wireless facilities, install wireless
facilities with antenna and other equipment that have the smallest visual
profile. The wireless provider shall provide all information necessary and
requested by the Village to establish that the replacement is substantially
similar. Wireless facilities that vary significantly in design, or increase
power output, frequency, bandwidth or performance, or change the location of
the small wireless facility upon the utility pole or wireless support
structure, or increase signal strength, or make other modifications in other
key components, are not substantially similar, and are subject to standard
application processes, permitting requirements, and fees. The Village has the
sole right and responsibility to determine if a proposed small wireless
facility is substantially similar to the existing small wireless facility. In
addition, when a radio transceiver or antennas are replaced or added to an
existing small wireless facility, and regardless of whether an application or
permit are required, the wireless provider shall provide certification to the
Village from a radio engineer that the continuing operation of the small
wireless facility complies with all applicable FCC standards, including, but
not limited to, radio frequency emissions; or
      3.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement
of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
The foregoing shall not exempt communications service providers from Village
permitting requirements where traffic patterns are affected or lane closures
are required. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018; amd. Ord. O2022-06, 3-1-2022)
13-8-6: CONSTRUCTION:
Collocations for which permits are approved shall be completed within one
hundred eighty (180) days of issuance of the permit, unless the Village agrees
to extend the period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Village
utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the
site, provided the applicant has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Permits that are not completed
within applicable timelines shall be void absent an extension granted in
writing by the Village. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-7: PERMIT DURATION:
Permits issued for small wireless facilities pursuant to this chapter shall be
for a period of five (5) years. Permits are subject to renewal at the end of
the five (5) year permit period for a successive five (5) year term so long as
the installation complies with the applicable code provisions in force at the
time of renewal. A finding by the Village at the time of a request for renewal
that an installation does not comply with the applicable code provisions in
force at the time of the renewal request shall be in writing. If the Act is
repealed or found unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, all
permits granted by the Village under this chapter shall terminate at the end of
their current term. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-8: HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
   A.   Antenna Installations: The maximum permitted height of a small wireless
facility is ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support structure
on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
   B.   New Poles: The maximum permitted height of new or replacement utility
pole or wireless support structure on which a small wireless facility is
collocated is the higher of:
      1.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted, and that is located within three
hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support
structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the Village. The Village
may designate which intersecting right-of- way within three hundred feet (300')
of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the
height limitation for such facility; or
      2.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
   C.   Variance Process: A wireless provider may receive a variance from the
Village Director of Public Services or his or her designee pursuant to the
procedures set forth in section
7-1G-21, “Variances”, of this Code, from the maximum permitted height of a new
pole set forth in this section, if the wireless provider, in addition to
demonstrating the conditions set forth in section
7-1G-21 of this Code have been established, can establish that:
      1.   Because of a particular unusual condition, a particular hardship or
practical difficulty to the wireless provider would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, and such hardship or difficulty has not been created
by the wireless provider; and
      2.   Existing utility poles or wireless support structures, or a new
utility pole at the maximum permitted height for a new pole allowed by this
section cannot accommodate the wireless facility at a height necessary to
function effectively, under reasonable terms and conditions; and
      3.   The use of existing utility poles or other wireless support
structures, or a new utility pole at the maximum permitted height for a new
pole allowed by this section, is not technically feasible. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-
2018; amd. Ord. O2022-06, 3-1-2022)
13-8-9: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Public Safety Technology: A wireless provider's operation of a small
wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
Village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this Code.
   B.   Prohibited: A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any
small wireless facility that:
      1.   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a
right-of-way;
      2.   Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
      3.   Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;
      4.   Violates or conflicts with this title or title 7, chapter 1, article
G, "Construction Of Utility Facilities In Rights-Of-Way", of this Code, or
other applicable regulations set forth in or adopted by this Code, except to
the extent such chapters, sections or regulations may be modified by the
provisions of this chapter; or
      5.   Violates the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC
section 12101 et seq.)
   C.   Contractual Requirements: Wireless providers shall comply with all
requirements imposed by a contract between the Village and any private property
owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles
and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
   D.   Ground-Mounted Equipment: Wireless providers shall comply with the
ground mounted equipment spacing requirements, within rights- of-way, if any,
as set forth in title 7, chapter 1, article G, "Construction Of Utility
Facilities In Rights-Of-Way", of this Code.
   E.   Undergrounding:
      1.   Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with Village Code
provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements, if any, that
prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles
or equipment in the right-of-way.
      2.   Variance: A wireless provider may receive a variance from the
Village Director of Public Services or his or her designee pursuant to the
procedures set forth in section
7-1G-21, “Variances”, of this Code, to allow a small wireless facility to be
located above ground in an area where Village ordinances or regulations
prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if, in addition to demonstrating
the conditions of section
7-1G-21 of this Code have been established, the wireless provider can establish
that:
         a.   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no
reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-
way; and
         b.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
and
         c.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety
hazard; and
         d.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies; and
         e.   Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the
above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location; and
         f.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not create a safety hazard; and
         g.   The above ground small wireless facility is located and designed
in such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on adjacent properties; and
         h.   In any historical area, that the above ground small wireless
facility will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of the area.
      3.   Screening For Ground Mounted Facilities: Where a ground- mounted
facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in
accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape engineer.
Plant materials shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting
materials. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance
of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
      4.   Future Undergrounding: The Village may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the Village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the Village shall
either:
         a.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         b.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   F.   Collocation Limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small
wireless facilities within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole on Village utility poles that are part of
an electric distribution or transmission system.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subsection, the terms “communications space”,
“communication worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   G.   Code Compliance: Wireless providers shall comply with applicable codes
and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
   H.   Radio Frequency Compliance: Wireless providers shall comply with the
FCC’s radio frequency emissions standards at all times. Wireless providers are
required to perform on-going monitoring of small wireless facilities to ensure
all equipment continues to operate within allowable FCC radio frequency
emission ranges and shall, on a quarterly basis, provide to the Village a
certification with supporting information confirming whether all of the
wireless provider’s small wireless facilities within the Village operated in
compliance with all FCC radio frequency emission limits during the quarterly
reporting period. The certified report for each quarter shall be delivered to
the village manager no later than April 30 (for quarter ending March 31), July
31 (for quarter ending June 30), October 31 (for quarter ending September 30),
and January 31 (for quarter ending December 31). A wireless provider shall,
upon request of the Village at any time, perform radio frequency testing of all
or specific small wireless facilities, provide such testing results to the
Village, and shall promptly respond to all Village requests for information
and/or cooperation with respect to any of the foregoing. Village staff may, at
the Village’s option, accompany the wireless provider or its agents in the
performance of such testing. Any small wireless facility found not to comply
with FCC radio frequency emission standards shall be immediately reported by
the wireless provider to the FCC, with a copy of such report sent at the same
time to the village manager, and shall be powered-down, adjusted, repaired,
and/or replaced, or shut off and/or removed by the wireless provider within
three (3) calendar days of the provider becoming aware of the violation. Small
wireless facilities that exceed the FCC’s radio frequency emissions standards
are declared a public nuisance, and may be summarily abated by the Village.
Failure by a wireless provider to cure a violation of the FCC radio frequency
emission standards within three (3) calendar days shall result in a revocation
of the applicable small wireless facility permit, and/or a citation for
maintaining a public nuisance with a fine in the amount of seven hundred and
fifty dollars ($750), with each day of continued operation without cure being a
separate violation. In the event the Village determines that a small wireless
facility is not in compliance with any legal requirements or conditions related
to radio frequency, the wireless provider shall, in addition to the foregoing,
be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the Village in connection
with the investigation, enforcement and/or remediation of such noncompliance.
   I.   Annual Certification: In January of each year, a wireless provider
shall submit an affidavit to the Village which shall list, by location, all
small wireless facilities it owns within the Village, and shall certify: (1)
each such installation remains in use; (2) such in-use facility remains covered
by required insurance; and (3) each such installation which is no longer in
use. Any small wireless facility that is no longer in use shall be removed by
the wireless provider within ninety (90) calendar days of delivery of the
affidavit. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018; amd. Ord. O2022-06, 3-1-2022)

generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth,
concealment, design and aesthetic requirements that are otherwise identified by
the Village in an ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village Board of
Trustees, in the Village’s comprehensive plan, or in a written design plan that
applies to other occupiers of the rights-of- way, including on a historic
landmark or in a Historic District.
   B.   Historic Districts And Landmarks: For areas designated as Historic
Districts, including but not limited to the Village’s National Register
Downtown Historic District and the Robbins Park Historic District, or on
buildings or structures designated as historic landmarks pursuant to title 14,
“Historic Preservation”, of this Code, in addition to the stealth, concealment

      4.   Small wireless facilities within the right-of-way or on private
property in any designated Historic District shall utilize stealth technology
and be designed in such a manner so as to preserve the character of district,
ensure consistency with the surrounding elements, blend architecturally with
any buildings or structures designated as historic landmarks or located within
a designated Historic District, and shall be designed to blend with the
surrounding historical landmarks and/or district in design and color.
      5.   Small wireless facilities within historic districts may, at the

   C.   Historic District Or Landmark Limitations:
      1.   Any stealth, concealment and design standards in a Historic District
or on a historic landmark, including restrictions on a specific category of
utility poles, may not have the effect of prohibiting any provider’s
technology. Such stealth, concealment and design measures shall not be
considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size
restrictions of a small wireless facility.
      2.   This section shall not be construed to limit the Village’s
enforcement of historic preservation in conformance with the requirements
adopted pursuant to the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources Preservation

control of a small wireless facility located within the jurisdiction of the
Village, provide written notice to the Village of such sale or transfer of
control. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-15: ABANDONMENT:
   A.   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period
of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of the
facility shall remove the small wireless facility and any associated wireless
support structure or utility pole within ninety (90) days after receipt of
written notice from the Village notifying it of the abandonment. The
requirement that a wireless support structure or utility pole associated with
an abandoned small wireless facility be removed does not apply if the owner of
the facility does not own or otherwise have the right to remove the structure
or pole, and does not apply to Village-owned utility poles unless requested by
the Village. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the Village to the owner at its last known address. If
the small wireless facility and associated wireless support structure or
utility pole, if any, is not removed within ninety (90) days after receipt of
such notice, such wireless facility and associated structure or pole shall be
deemed to be a nuisance and the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility, structure or pole and recover or place a lien for its costs, pursuant
to the terms of its pole attachment or other agreement for Village utility
poles or through the procedures for abatement of nuisances set forth in this
code.

longer using the small wireless facilities to provide wireless service, it may
send the wireless provider written notice that requires the wireless provider
to remove the small wireless facility and associated wireless support structure
or utility pole or provide proof that the small wireless facility is
operational and still being used within thirty (30) days, and informs the
wireless provider that failure to provide proof or to remove the small wireless
facility, and any associated wireless support structure or utility pole will
result in the Village removing the small wireless facility, structure or pole
at the wireless provider’s cost. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018; amd. Ord. O2022-06,
3-1-2022)
13-8-16: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
The Circuit Court of DuPage County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve
all disputes arising under the Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning
rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on Village utility poles
within the right-of-way, the Village shall allow the collocating person to
collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year per pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution
of the dispute. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-17: INDEMNIFICATION:
Other than for liabilities and losses due to or caused by the sole negligence
of the Village or its employees or agents, a wireless provider shall indemnify
and hold the Village harmless against any and all liability or loss from
personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole
or in part, the use or occupancy of the Village infrastructure or improvements,
or right-of-way associated with such infrastructure or improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider proceeding under this chapter waives any claims it may have against
the Village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-18: INSURANCE:
At all times during the period in which a wireless provider's facilities are
located on Village infrastructure, improvements or in right-of-way, the
wireless provider shall, at its own sole cost and expense, carry the following
insurance coverages:
   A.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
   B.   Workers' compensation insurance within statutory limits as required by
law; and
   C.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the Village infrastructure, improvements or rights- of-way, including
coverage for bodily injury and property damage, with limits not less than:
      1.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
      2.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
      3.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability.
The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and shall provide certificates of insurance
and proof of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy
to the Village prior to the collocation of any small wireless facility, and
shall keep updated certificates and proof of inclusion on file with the Village
at all times that the provider maintains small wireless facilities within the
Village.
   D.   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limits required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement that the Village be named an additional insured. A wireless
provider that self- insures shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance limits required
by the Village. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-19: MAINTENANCE OF SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES:
   A.   A wireless provider shall maintain all small wireless facilities
installed within the Village in a condition that maintains the safety,
integrity and aesthetics of such facilities. Small wireless facilities shall
not appear to be unkempt. In the event of a failure to properly maintain such
facilities, the Village shall notify the wireless provider, in writing, who
shall have thirty (30) days to correct the identified maintenance violation. If
not corrected within such period, the Village reserves the right to take such
action as it deems necessary, including revocation of the permit. Maintenance
and replacement of small wireless facilities shall be performed by the wireless
provider at the wireless provider's sole cost and expense.
   B.   In the event of an emergency involving an imminent threat to life or
property, the Village may take corrective action to eliminate such emergency at
the wireless provider's expense. (Ord. O2018-38, 9-4-2018)
13-8-20: REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
   A.   A permit to collocate a small wireless facility may be revoked for one
or more of the following reasons:
      1.   The wireless provider obtained approval by means of fraud or made a
misrepresentation of a material fact with respect to the permit application, or
any required documentation or submittal.
      2.   The wireless provider failed to construct the small wireless
facility in accordance with the approved plans.
      3.   The wireless provider failed to comply within any material condition

90.675.
      11.   The small wireless facility has been abandoned and the wireless
provider has failed to remove the small wireless facility as provided in this
chapter.
      12.   The small wireless facility is found to have been in violation of
FCC radio frequency emission standards and the wireless provider, after
becoming aware of such violation, fails to shut-down or otherwise cure the
violation within three (3) calendar days.
   B.   Written notification of the permit revocation shall be sent by
certified mail or shall be personally delivered to the wireless provider
setting forth the basis for the revocation. The wireless provider shall, within
fourteen days of the notice of revocation, file a written response with the
Village’s director of public services or his or her designee setting forth the
reasons why the permit should not be revoked along with such evidence in
opposition to the revocation as the wireless provider determines necessary.
Failure to file a response with the Village’s director of public services or
his or her designee shall be deemed an admission of the facts set forth in the
notification of written notification and shall result in automatic revocation
of the permit. The Village’s director of public services or his or her designee
shall render findings and a decision within twenty-one days of the date of
receipt of the wireless provider’s response, if any.
   C.   If the Village’s director of public services or his or her designee

upon request or consent of the applicant. (Ord. O2001-12, 3-6-2001)
14-3-4: RECOMMENDATIONS BY HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
   A.   General: The commission shall review all information presented to it at
the public hearing and shall adopt a recommendation that the nominated landmark
or historic district does or does not meet the criteria for designation as
herein prescribed. The commission may recommend that an area consisting of less
than all of the properties included in the original application be designated
as an historic district, as long as the smaller recommended district complies
with all requirements for consent of owners of record under this chapter. The
recommendation shall contain the following information:
      1.   The commission's rationale for recommending either approval or
rejection of the nomination;
      2.   In the case of a recommendation of approval of designation of a
landmark, the significant feature or features in the exterior architectural
appearance of the landmark that should be protected and preserved;
      3.   In the case of a recommendation of approval or designation of an
historic district, the significant features in the exterior architectural
appearance of any structures, buildings, or sites within the historic district
that should be protected and preserved; and
      4.   Any other pertinent comments related to the nomination of the
landmark or historic district.
   B.   Landmarks: In the case of a nominated landmark, within forty five (45)
days following the conclusion of the public hearing, the commission shall
transmit to the village board its recommendation in the form specified by
subsection 2-12-6A of this code. The failure of the commission to act within
forty five (45) days following the conclusion of such hearing, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the
approval of the application for designation as submitted. The village board
shall promptly act on such recommendation.
   C.   Historic Districts: In the case of a nominated historic district, such
recommendation by the commission shall be deemed preliminary and shall be
accompanied by action of the commission requiring that notice be given to all
owners of record of property within the nominated district that the nominated
district has been preliminarily determined to meet the standards for
designation as an historic district and allowing such owners of record an
opportunity to complete a form indicating whether the owner consents to the
designation of the nominated district. The manner of obtaining such consent
shall be pursuant to section
14-3-6 of this chapter. Following receipt of the results of the consent forms
submitted by the owners of record, the commission shall reconsider its
preliminary recommendation and shall issue a final recommendation to the
village board within forty five (45) days following receipt of the results. The
commission shall transmit to the village board its recommendation in the form
specified by subsection 2-12-6A of this code. The failure of the commission to
act within forty five (45) days following the receipt of the results, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation
for the approval of the application for designation as submitted. The village
board shall promptly act on such recommendation.
   D.   Recommendations On File: All recommendations by the commission shall be
filed with the village manager and made available to persons requesting the
same in writing. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-5: DESIGNATION BY VILLAGE BOARD:
An ordinance passed by the affirmative vote of at least four (4) members of the
Village Board shall be required to designate an official landmark or historic
district. Upon passing an ordinance approving the nomination for a landmark or
historic district designation, the Village Board shall direct that notice be
sent to the Building Commissioner and to the owners of record advising them of
such designation and informing them that any structure, building, site, or area
designated as a landmark or located within the boundaries of a designated
historic district shall thereafter be subject to the requirements of Chapter 5
of this Title. The Village Board shall also direct that the ordinance approving
a landmark or historic district designation be recorded in the offices of the
appropriate County Recorder of Deeds. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-6: CONSENT OF OWNERS OF RECORD IN PROPOSED HISTORIC DISTRICT:
   A.   Manner Of Consent: In the event that the Commission makes a preliminary
recommendation that an historic district should be designated and that notice
shall be given in accordance with subsection 14-3-4C of this Chapter, the
notice shall include one or more written forms on which the owners of record of
each site within the proposed district may indicate their ownership and whether
or not they consent to the designation of the proposed district. If a site is
owned by more than one owner of record, only one consent form may be submitted
for that site. The forms for such consent shall be prepared in a manner that
enables the Village to verify whether the person submitting the consent form is
the owner of record while keeping the owner's name separate from the owner's
indication of whether or not the owner consents to the designation.
   B.   Effect Of Consent: No historic district shall be designated by the
Village without affirmative written consent to such designation by the owners
of record of more than fifty percent (50%) of the sites within the proposed
district. However, the Village shall not be required to designate any proposed
district because of the affirmative written consent to such designation by the
owners of record of more than fifty percent (50%) of the sites within the
proposed district. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-7: DENIAL OF DESIGNATION:
An applicant whose nomination for a landmark or historic district designation
is denied by the Village Board may request reconsideration by filing a written
request within thirty (30) days after a decision denying designation is
rendered; provided, however, that the Village Board shall reconsider a
nomination only if substantial new evidence or information regarding the
nominated landmark or historic district is provided. Once a nomination has been
denied by the Village Board, no further nominations involving substantially the
same relief under this Chapter for any structure, building, site, or area whose
designation was denied may be filed for ninety (90) days; provided, however,
that this period does not apply to an application to designate a landmark
within an area for which historic district designation was denied. (Ord. O2000-
7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-8: STAY OF PROCEEDINGS:
No building, demolition, sign, or other permit shall be issued for a proposed
landmark or a structure, building, site, or area in a proposed historic
district from the date when the nomination form is filed with the Village
Manager until the final disposition of the nomination unless the process for
certificate of appropriateness review required by Chapter 5 of this Title is
completed. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-9: LANDMARK DESIGNATION CONTROLS:
In the event that a building, structure, or site has been designated as both a
landmark and as part of an historic district, the requirements, limitations,
restrictions, and regulations contained in this Title pertaining to landmarks
shall control over the requirements, limitations, restrictions, and regulations
pertaining to historic districts, including, without limitation, the
requirements contained in Chapter 5 of this Title regarding the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-10: SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred: Whenever any
application filed pursuant to this Chapter has been finally denied on its
merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or
not in the same form or on the same theory, shall not be brought unless in the
opinion of the Village Manager or the Commission there is substantial new
evidence available or a mistake of law or fact significantly affected the prior
denial.
   B.   New Grounds To Be Stated: Any such second application shall include a
detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such application.
   C.   Summary Denial With Or Without Hearing: Any such second application may
be denied by the Village Manager summarily, and without hearing, on a finding
that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where such
application is set for hearing, the applicant shall be required to establish
grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application prior to
being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds are
established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such failure.
   D.   Exception: Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second
application filed more than two (2) years after the final denial of a prior
application shall be heard on the merits as though no prior application had
been filed. The applicant shall, however, be required to place in the record
all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have
developed since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such
evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.

5-1-2000; amd. Ord. O2024-07, 4-2-2024)
14-5-2: CRITERIA:
All applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the
applicable standards in this section.
   A.   General Standards:
      1.   Alterations that do not affect any essential architectural or
historic features of a structure or building as viewed from a public or private
street ordinarily should be permitted.
      2.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure,
building, or site and its environment should not be destroyed. No alteration or
demolition of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should
be permitted except when necessary to assure an economically viable use of a
site.
      3.   All structures, buildings, sites, and areas should be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that
seek to create an earlier appearance than the true age of the property are
discouraged.
      4.   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a structure, building, or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance should be recognized and respected when dealing with a
specific architectural period.
      5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a structure, building, site, or area should ordinarily be
maintained and preserved.
      6.   Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      7.   The surface cleaning of structures and buildings should be
undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning
methods that will damage the structures and buildings should be avoided.
      8.   New structures or buildings, or alterations to sites should not be
discouraged when such structures or alterations do not destroy significant
historical or architectural features and are compatible with the size, scale,
color, material, and character of the site, neighborhood, or environment.
      9.   Whenever possible, new structures or buildings, or alterations to
the existing conditions of sites should be done in such a manner that, if such
new structures or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential
form and integrity of the original structure, building, site, or area would be
unimpaired.
      10.   Any permitted alteration or demolition should promote the purposes
of this Title and general welfare of the Village and its residents.
      11.   Demolition should not be permitted if a structure, building, or
site is economically viable in its present condition or could be economically
viable after completion of appropriate alterations, even if demolition would
permit a more profitable use of such site.
   B.   Design Standards:
      1.   Height: The height of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with the height of the original landmark. The height of a structure
or building and adjacent open spaces after any proposed alteration or
construction within an historic district should be compatible with the style
and character of the structure or building and with surrounding structures and
buildings in an historic district.
      2.   Relationship Between Mass And Open Space: The relationship between a
landmark and adjacent open spaces after its alteration should be compatible
with such relationship prior to such alteration. The relationship between a
structure or building and adjacent open spaces after alteration within an
historic district should be compatible with the relationship between
surrounding structures, buildings and adjacent open spaces within such historic
district.
      3.   Relationship Among Height, Width And Scale: The relationship among
the height, width, and scale of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with such relationship prior to such alteration. The relationship
among height, width, and scale of a structure or building after an alteration
within an historic district should be compatible with the relationship among
height, width, and scale of surrounding structures and buildings within such
historic district.
      4.   Directional Expression: The directional expressions of a landmark
after alteration, whether its vertical or horizontal positioning, should be
compatible with the directional expression of the original landmark. The
directional expression of a structure or building after alteration within an
historic district should be compatible with the directional expression of
surrounding structures and buildings within such historic district.
      5.   Roof Shape: The roof shape of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with the roof shape of the original landmark. The roof shape of a
structure, building, or object after alteration within an historic district
should be compatible with the roof shape of surrounding structures and
buildings within such historic district.
      6.   Architectural Details, General Designs, Materials, Textures, And
Colors: The architectural details, general design, materials, textures, and
colors of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the
architectural details, general design, materials, textures, and colors of the
original landmark. The architectural details, general design, materials,
textures, and colors of a structure or building after alteration within an
historic district should be compatible with the architectural details, general
design, materials, textures, and colors of surrounding structures and buildings
within such historic district.
      7.   Landscape And Appurtenances: The landscape and appurtenances,
including without limitation signs, fences, accessory structures, and pavings,
of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the landscape and
appurtenances of the original landmark. The landscape and appurtenances of a
structure or building after alteration within an historic district should be
compatible with the landscape and appurtenances of surrounding structures and
buildings within such historic district.
      8.   Construction: New construction in an historic district should be
compatible with the architectural styles, design standards and streetscapes
within such historic districts.
   C.   Additional Standards: In addition to the foregoing standards, the
commission may consider the secretary of the interior's standards for
rehabilitation guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings (revised 1983),
and any amendments thereto, in reviewing any application under this section.
(Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-5-3: PRELIMINARY APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN REVIEW MEETING:
   A.   Mandatory Preliminary Application Requirements: Any person proposing
either of the following are required to submit a preliminary application for a
certificate of appropriateness:
      1.   The demolition, removal or relocation of any designated landmark; or
      2.   The demolition, removal or relocation of an existing residence
within the Robbins Park Historic District, or the construction of a new
residence within the Robbins Park Historic District.
   B.   Discretionary Preliminary Review by Historic Preservation Commission:
While only application types specified in subsection A. above are required to
submit a preliminary application and are subject to the requirements of this
Section, any other party seeking a certificate of appropriateness is free to,
and is encouraged to, seek informal preliminary input from the Historic
Preservation Commission prior to submission of a formal application.
   C.   Village Exemption: The Village is exempt from the preliminary
application and Design Review Meeting requirements of this section and Chapter.
   D.   Preliminary Application Forms, Required Information and Filing
Procedures: A preliminary application for a certificate of appropriateness
shall be filed with the director of community development, on forms provided by
the community development department. The application form shall be completed
in its entirety and shall include such information as determined by the Village
to be necessary to allow an initial design review by the Ad Hoc Historic
District Design Review Team. The information provided shall include concept
plans and/or building elevations of any proposed new residence or replacement
residence within the Robbins Park Historic District.
   E.   Purpose of Design Review Meeting: The purpose of a Design Review
Meeting is to broadly acquaint the Ad Hoc Historic District Design Review Team
with the applicant's proposal, in order to help an applicant gain an
understanding of the type of architectural design elements preferred by the
Team, Commission and Board of Trustees. The Meeting serves the additional
purpose of providing the applicant with any preliminary views or concerns that
members of the Ad Hoc Historic District Design Review Team may have at a time
in the process when designs and plans are still flexible, where adjustment is
still possible, and prior to the time when the applicant is required to expend
the funds necessary to prepare the complete documentation required for a formal
application. In addition, the Design Review Meeting also serves as an
opportunity for the Ad Hoc Historic District Design Review Team to determine
whether, in cases involving the demolition, relocation or removal of any
structure, building, site or area within a designated historic district, the
building or property has sufficient architectural or historic merit to warrant
conducting a full Historic and Architectural Impact Study prior to
consideration of a formal application.
   F.   Receipt of Preliminary Application/Setting of Design Review Meeting:
Following the proper filing of a complete preliminary application, and the
formation of the Ad Hoc Historic District Design Review Team assigned to the
application, the director of community development shall forward the
application to the Ad Hoc Historic District Design Review Team members for
their review.
   G.   Design Review Meeting: Upon receipt of an application, the Ad Hoc
Historic District Design Review Team members shall conduct a review of the
proposed demolition and concept plans for any new or replacement structure.
Team members shall provide their comments and feedback on the proposed
demolition and concept plans to an applicant through a meeting within thirty
(30) days of Team formation. The Team shall meet with an applicant as a group
at a location of their choosing, or via a video conferencing application, or a
combination of both. Such meetings are intended to be informal, in order to
facilitate productive discussion between an applicant and the Ad Hoc Historic
District Design Review Team members. The applicant, property owner and design
professional must be in attendance at the Design Review Meeting to ensure both
receive and understand any comments provided by the Team. Any views expressed
in the course of the Team's review of any preliminary application shall be
deemed to be advisory and only the individual preliminary views of the Team
member expressing them. Nothing said or done in the course of such review shall
be deemed to create, or to prejudice, any rights of the applicant or to
obligate the Historic Preservation Commission or Village Board, or any member
of it, to approve or deny any formal application following full consideration
thereof as required by this Title. If a Design Review Meeting does not take
place within thirty (30) days of the formation of the Ad Hoc Historic District
Design Review Team for any reason other than the unavailability of the
applicant, property owner and/or design professional, the applicant may proceed
to file a formal application for a certificate of appropriateness prior to a
Design Review Meeting occurring and without having received comments or a
recommendation from the Design Review Team.
   H.   Recommendation and Comments: At the conclusion of the Design Review
Meeting, the Ad Hoc Historic District Design Review Team shall summarize its
recommendations and comments on the proposed design and any other matters
before it. Such recommendations and comments shall be reduced to writing and
may include any proposed changes it would like an applicant to make to the
conceptual design prior to submission of a formal certificate of
appropriateness application. The recommendations and comments shall be provided
to the applicant, along with a copy to village staff and a copy to the Historic
Preservation Commission, within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of
the Design Review Meeting.
   I.   Determination Regarding Historic and Architectural Impact Study: In
cases involving the demolition, removal or relocation of any designated
landmark demolition, relocation or removal of a residence within the Robbins
Park Historic District, where a majority of the Team members determine that the
affected residence has sufficient architectural or historic merit to warrant
conducting a full Historic and Architectural Impact Study, such Study shall be
prepared by the applicant, at the applicant's sole cost and expense, and be
provided to the Village as part of a formal application. The Study shall
include the information set forth in Section
14-5-4.B. Factors to be used in determining the necessity of a full Historic
and Architectural Impact Study include any history provided by the Village, and
any other information received by the Team at the Design Review Meeting. (Ord.
O2024-07, 4-2-2024)
14-5-4: FORMAL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Formal Application Requirements: Any person proposing an alteration,
demolition, signage, or any other physical modifications to the exterior
architectural appearance of a designated landmark, or the demolition,
relocation, or removal of an existing residence located in the Robbins Park
Historic District, or construction of a new residence located within the
Robbins Park Historic District, shall submit a formal application for a
certificate of appropriateness as a precondition to commencing such action or
obtaining such permit. The filing of a preliminary application, subsequent
Design Review Meeting, and receipt of a recommendation and comments from the Ad
Hoc Historic District Design Review Team are necessary prerequisites to filing
a full formal application for a certificate of appropriateness in cases where
such preliminary application, Design Review Meeting and recommendation are
mandatory pursuant to section
14-5-3. A formal application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be
filed with the director of community development, on forms provided by the
community development department. The application form shall be completed in
its entirety and shall include such information as determined to be necessary
by the Village to allow consideration of the application by the Commission. In
the case of a demolition, relocation or removal of an existing residence, or
construction of a new residence, plans and specifications for the proposed new
or replacement structure, including information pertaining to landscaping,
massing, relationship to site and streetscape, scale, and signs shall be
included as part of the application. No formal application for a certificate of
appropriateness requesting demolition or construction of a new residence shall
be deemed complete without inclusion of such information absent a waiver of
this requirement by the Commission. In the event that the Commission denies a
requested waiver of the requirement to provide such information, the applicant
may appeal the Commission's denial of the waiver to the Village Board by filing
an appeal in writing to the village manager within fifteen (15) days after the
Commission's denial. The Village Board may affirm the decision not to waive the
application requirement, or may overturn the Commission's decision, with or
without conditions. If the waiver is granted, an otherwise completed
application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be considered by the
Commission; and
   B.   Historic and Architectural Impact Study: In cases involving the
demolition, relocation or removal of any existing residence within the Robbins
Park Historic District, where a majority of the Ad Hoc Historic District Design
Review Team determined that the existing residence has sufficient architectural
or historic merit to warrant conducting a full Historic and Architectural
Impact Study, such study shall be provided, at the applicant's sole cost and
expense, as part of a formal application. The study shall be prepared by the
Hinsdale Historical Society or one or more persons who are qualified to render
opinions on the architectural style and merit of buildings, the historical
significance of buildings, or both. In no event shall an applicant be required
to pay in excess of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) to the Hinsdale
Historical Society for preparation of the Impact Study. If the Historical
Society quotes a price in excess of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) for
preparation of the Study, the applicant may decline to include an Impact Study
as part of the formal application. The study shall include the following
information where available from the Hinsdale Historical Society or other
readily available sources:
      1.   Information on Preparers. The names, addresses, qualifications and
experience of all persons who prepared any part of the study.
      2.   Ownership History of the Property. The Historic and Architectural
Impact Study shall trace the ownership of the property since its construction
and identify any owner who had or has a significant role in the history of the
Village, State of Illinois or United States, or who is tied to a significant
event in the history of the Village, State of Illinois or United States.
      3.   Construction History of the Property. The Historic and Architectural
Impact Study shall provide a narrative description of all alterations made to
the exterior of any building and open space on the property since the date of
original construction, including the addition or removal of accessory
structures, including the dates of such work and the architect(s) involved.
      4.   Architectural Significance of the Property. The Historic and
Architectural Impact Study shall identify the original and all subsequent
architects, providing information on the importance and range of influence of
each. The Study shall also evaluate the architectural style, including
detailing materials, craftsmanship, methods of construction and rarity, and
shall include interior and exterior photographs to illustrate such
characteristics.
      5.   Landmark Status of the Property. The Historic and Architectural
Impact Study shall state whether the property or structures have been:
         a.   designated a landmark pursuant to this title;
         b.   included in the most recent Illinois Historic Structures Survey
conducted under the auspices of the Illinois Department of Conservation; or
         c.   listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the
Illinois Register of Historic Places.
      6.   Impact on Immediate Neighborhood. The Historic and Architectural
Impact Study shall also consider the contribution of the residence to the
neighborhood, the existence of a particular grouping of similar styles, periods
or types of property relating to the structure, and the resulting impact that
the proposed demolition will have on the immediate neighborhood.
      7.   Historic or Architectural Features Warranting Preservation. The
historic and architectural impact study shall specifically identify any
critical exterior historical or architectural features of the residence that
warrant preservation.
   C.   Receipt of Formal Application/Setting of Consideration of Application:
Following the proper filing of a complete formal application, the director of
community development shall cause such application to be referred to the
Commission for placement on the agenda of the next Commission meeting held
thirty (30) days or more after the date of its filing for consideration of the
application. Notice of such meeting shall be given in accordance with section
14-1-4 of this title.
   D.   Review Of Formal Application:
      1.   Public Meeting If No Demolition, Relocation or Removal: After the
filing of a properly completed formal application for a certificate of
appropriateness that does not include any request for demolition, relocation or
removal, or construction of a new residence the Commission shall conduct a
public meeting on the application. Notice of the meeting shall be given in
accordance with section
14-1-4 of this title. The meeting shall be commenced, conducted and concluded,
and a decision on the certificate of appropriateness issued by the Commission
as soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
properly completed formal application has been filed, unless such time is
extended by agreement of the applicant or the applicant failed to appear.
Unless such time is extended by agreement of the applicant, or the applicant
failed to appear, the failure by the Commission to render a decision within
sixty (60) days shall be deemed approval by the Commission of the certificate
of appropriateness.
      2.   Public Hearing If Demolition, Relocation, Or Removal: After the
filing of a properly completed formal application for a certificate of
appropriateness that includes a request for demolition, relocation, or removal,
or construction of a new residence, the cCommission shall conduct a public
hearing on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance
with section
14-1-4 of this title, and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with
section
14-1-5 of this title. The applicant, property owner and design professional
must be in attendance at the public meeting to ensure both receive and
understand any comments provided by the Commission. The hearing shall be
commenced, conducted and concluded and a decision on the certificate
appropriateness shall be made by the Commission as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than sixty (60) days after the public hearing on the application
has commenced, unless such time is extended by agreement of the applicant or
the applicant, property owner and/or design professional failed to appear.
Unless such time is extended by agreement of the applicant, or the applicant,
property owner and/or design professional failed to appear at a meeting or
meetings as required by this section, the failure by the Commission to conclude
the hearing and render a decision within sixty (60) days shall be deemed
approval by the Commission of the certificate of appropriateness. (Ord. O2024-
07, 4-2-2024)

reasonable return to present or future owners.
   C.   Study Period: If the Commission finds that without approval of the
proposed work, the property cannot obtain a reasonable economic return
therefrom, then the application shall be delayed for a period not to exceed
forty five (45) days. During this period of delay, the Commission shall

14-7-3: HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURES PROPERTY LIST:
   A.   Creation of List. The primary goal of the Historic Overlay District
created in Article VIII, Part II (Historic Overlay District) of the Hinsdale
Zoning Code is to incentivize the preservation, rehabilitation, enhancement and
restoration of structures within the Historic Overlay District that are deemed
to be of historical significance. To that end, the Village shall create, and
the Village Clerk shall maintain, a Historically Significant Structures
Property List within the Historic Overlay District to which regulations within
the Overlay District may apply. Such list shall be created pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this chapter and shall be included as Appendix 1 to
this chapter.
   B.   Review Criteria. In order for a property to be deemed to host a
Historically Significant Structure and be included on the Historically
Significant Structures Property List, a property must be located within the
Historic Overlay District and meet one (1) or more of the following criteria:
      1.   The property or one (1) or more structures on the property are
associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
      2.   The property or one (1) or more structures on the property are
associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
      3.   One (1) or more structures on the property embodies the distinctive
characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or represents the
work of a master, or possesses high artistic values, or represents a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction;
      4.   The property or one (1) or more structures on the property yields,
or may be likely to yield, information important to history or prehistory;

source of civic pride or identity for the community.
   C.   Process - Creation of Historically Significant Structures Property
List.
      1.   The Historic Preservation Commission, using existing Village
studies, historical materials and maps, and their own expertise, shall, within
one hundred eighty (180) days of approval of the Ordinance creating the
Historic Overlay District, compile an Initial List of properties proposed for
inclusion on the Historically Significant Structures Property List.
      2.   Upon creation of the Initial List, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall hold a public hearing or hearings relative to the Initial List
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
14-1-4.C. of this Title 14.
      3.   Multiple properties proposed for inclusion on the Historically
Significant Structures Property List may be considered at a single hearing and
may be included on the hearing notice. Multiple rounds of public hearings may
be held regarding properties proposed for inclusion on the Historically
Significant Structures Property List for administrative convenience.
      4.   Following the public hearing, the Historic Preservation Commission
shall determine whether each property on the Initial List possesses one or more
of the criteria set forth in Subsection B above and make a recommendation to
the Board of Trustees as to whether each property included on the Initial List
should be included on the Historically Significant Structures Property List.
The recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission shall be forwarded
to the Board of Trustees for consideration.
      5.   The Board of Trustees shall consider the recommendations of the
Historic Preservation Commission and may approve or deny the inclusion of each
property on the Initial List for inclusion on the Historically Significant
Structures Property List. The Board of Trustees may also remand the Initial
List, or individual properties on the Initial List, to the Historic
Preservation Commission for further consideration or for additional information
without further public hearing.
   D.   Process - Adding Properties to the Historically Significant Structures
Property List.
      1.   Additional properties not on the Initial List may be considered as
additions to the Historically Significant Structures Property List at any time
upon application of an individual property owner, or upon direction from the
Board of Trustees or Historic Preservation Commission.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall hold a public hearing or hearings relative to the property
proposed to be added to the Historically Significant Structures Property List.
Notice of the public hearing shall be given pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section
14-1-4.C. of this Title 14.
      3.   Following the public hearing, the Historic Preservation Commission
shall determine whether the property proposed to be added to the Historically
Significant Structures Property List possesses one or more of the criteria set
forth in Subsection B above and make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees
as to whether the property shall be added to the Historically Significant
Structures Property List. The recommendation of the Historic Preservation
Commission shall be forwarded to the Board of Trustees for consideration.
      4.   The Board of Trustees shall consider the recommendation of the
Historic Preservation Commission and may approve or deny the inclusion of each
property on the Historically Significant Structures Property List. The Board of
Trustees may also remand a property to the Historic Preservation Commission for
further consideration or for additional information, without further public
hearing.
   E.   Notification of Inclusion of a Property on the Historically Significant
Structures Property List.
      1.   Upon approval of a property for inclusion on the Historically
Significant Structures Property List, a notification of inclusion shall be sent

effort to publicize the List and incentives available.
      3.   A Notice of Historically Significant Property shall be recorded
against title to each property approved for inclusion on the Historically
Significant Property list. The notice shall reference this Chapter, Article
VIII, Part II (Historic Overlay District) of the Zoning Code and the
availability of the Preservation Incentives specified herein.
   F.   Process - Removal of Properties from the Historically Significant
Structures Property List.
      1.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall periodically, but no less
often than every five (5) years, undertake a review of the Historically
Significant Structures Property List to determine whether properties on the
List should be proposed for removal from the List due to changed circumstances.
In addition, individual properties on the Historically Significant Structures
Property List may be considered for removal from the List at any time upon
application of an individual property owner, or upon direction from the Board
of Trustees or Historic Preservation Commission.
      2.   A property with a Historically Significant Structure on it may be
removed from the Historically Significant Structures Property List when it is
found that due to changed circumstances, the qualities which caused the
structure to be originally eligible for inclusion on the List have been lost or
destroyed, or where it has otherwise ceased to meet the criteria that made it
originally eligible for inclusion.
      3.   A property shall be automatically removed from the Historically
Significant Structures Property List upon demolition of the historically
significant structure on the property, without the need for hearing or other
action by the Historic Preservation Commission or Board of Trustees.
      4.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public hearing or
hearings relative to any property proposed to be removed from the Historically
Significant Structures Property List due to changed circumstances. Notice of
the public hearing shall be given pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Chapter 14-1 of this Title 14.
      5.   Following the public hearing, the Historic Preservation Commission
shall determine whether the property proposed to be removed from the
Historically Significant Structures Property List meets the criteria in
Subsection F.2 above and make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees as to
whether the property should be removed from the Historically Significant
Structures Property List. The recommendation of the Historic Preservation
Commission shall be forwarded to the Board of Trustees for consideration.
      6.   The Board of Trustees shall consider the recommendation of the
Historic Preservation Commission and the criteria set forth in Subsection F.2.
above, and may approve or deny the removal of each property from the
Historically Significant Structures Property List. The Board of Trustees may
also remand a property to the Historic Preservation Commission for further
consideration or for additional information, without further public hearing.
      7.   Upon removal of a property from the Historically Significant
Structures Property List, a Notice of Removal shall be mailed to the owner and/
or occupant and recorded against title to the property. The notice shall
reference this Chapter, Article VIII, Part II (Historic Overlay District) of
the Hinsdale Zoning Code, the previously recorded Notice of Historically
Significant Property, and the fact that Preservation Incentives are no longer
available for the property. (Ord. O2022-27, 9-20-2022)

issuance of a Preservation Incentive Certificate pursuant to Section
14-7-5 below, perform exterior alterations, additions, rehabilitation,
restoration or relocation of or to any structure on a property on the
Historically Significant Structures Property List and incur documented eligible
costs of $50,000 or more. In the event an Applicant seeks both a property tax
rebate incentive and a grant or rebate incentive, the eligible project costs
being matched for grant or rebate purposes cannot be counted towards the

Board of Trustees, and shall only be available in the following circumstances:

   G.   Grants or Matching Funds. Grants or façade improvement matching fund
rebate incentives from the Village's Historic Preservation Fund may be awarded

seeks both a grant or rebate incentive and a property tax rebate incentive, the
eligible project costs being matched for grant or rebate purposes cannot be
counted towards the $50,000 in documented eligible costs for purposes of
reaching the threshold amount for property tax rebate eligibility. Grant or
rebate incentives are subject to compliance with program requirements,
application, available funding, approval of a Preservation Incentive
Certificate and approval by the Board of Trustees.
   H.   Alternative Bulk Standards. Alternative Bulk Zoning Standards as
detailed in Section 8-205 of the Zoning Code may be utilized in alterations,
additions, rehabilitation, restoration or relocation work or other physical
modifications of or to any structure on a property on the Historically
Significant Structures Property List, or for other historic preservation
projects related to any structure on a property on the Historically Significant
Structures Property List, subject to compliance with any program requirements,
application, approval of a Preservation Incentive Certificate, and approval by
the Historic Preservation Commission and, if applicable, the Board of Trustees.
(Ord. O2022-27, 9-20-2022)
14-7-5: PRESERVATION INCENTIVES PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Incentives Optional. Preservation Incentives are only available to
Applicants, as defined in Section
14-7-2 above. The use of Incentives by the owner of a structure on a property
on the Historically Significant Structures Property List is optional. If the
owner of a structure on a property on the Historically Significant Structures
Properties List chooses not to utilize Preservation Incentives, the bulk
standards of the underlying Base Zoning District shall apply.
   B.   Preservation Incentive Certificate Required. A Preservation Incentive
Certificate authorizing specific Preservation Incentives is required prior to
undertaking any project utilizing Preservation Incentives and that involves any
exterior alterations, additions, rehabilitation, restoration or relocation of
or to any structure on a property on the Historically Significant Structures
Property List, except as otherwise set forth below. Preservation Incentives are
not available for, and a Preservation Incentive Certificate is not required
for, the following:
      1.   Painting.
      2.   Landscaping.
      3.   Fences.
      4.   Driveways, sidewalks, and other paved areas.
      5.   Reversible appurtenances, including air conditioning units, gutters,
downspouts, antennas, satellite dishes and mailboxes.
      6.   Routine maintenance and cleaning.
      7.   New detached garages or changes to existing detached garages, unless
the detached garage is considered a historically significant structure.
      8.   Any accessory building or structure other than a garage (e.g., shed,
rear deck, patio, trellis, etc.), unless the accessory building or structure is
considered a historically significant structure.
      9.   Interior improvements or work.
   C.   Application. An Applicant may apply for one (1) or more of the
Preservation Incentives set forth in Section
14-7-4 by submitting an application on a form provided by the Department of
Community Development. Such application shall include plans for any exterior
alterations, additions, rehabilitation, restoration or relocation, and any
other information required by the Village.
   D.   No Property Tax Owed; No Debts. No application for a Preservation
Incentive shall be considered where there are outstanding real estate property
taxes owed on the property, or where other fines, penalties, debts or
obligations of the property owner and Applicant, if different than the owner,
are due and owing to the Village.
   E.   Public Meeting. A completed application shall be reviewed by the
Historic Preservation Commission at a public meeting for consideration as to
the issuance of a Preservation Incentive Certificate.
   F.   Design Criteria and Development Standards for Properties in the
Historic Overlay District Utilizing Preservation Incentives. A Preservation
Incentive Certificate shall be approved by the Historic Preservation Commission
if it complies with the following standards:
      1.   The exterior alterations, additions, rehabilitation, restoration or
relocation of or to any structure on a property on the Historically Significant
Structures Property List is found by the Historic Preservation Commission to be
consistent with, or compatible with, the historical nature of the structure.
Consideration of whether this standard is met shall be guided by the Secretary
of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, where
applicable, and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as
follows:
         a.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in
a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site environment;
         b.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
         c.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken;
         d.   Most properties and structures change over time; those changes
that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
         e.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated
with sensitivity;
         f.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities, and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence;
         g.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible;
         h.   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;
         i.   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment;
         j.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      2.   The proposed exterior alterations, additions, rehabilitation,
repairs or relocation will not have any significant adverse impact on adjacent
properties. Such adverse impacts include, but are not limited to, stormwater
runoff impacts.
      3.   All other Village code requirements must be met.
   G.   Final Determination.
      1.   For applications seeking Preservation Incentives in the form of
waivers of fees, expedited process, or alternative bulk standards, as detailed
in Section
14-7-4, where a majority of the then-sitting members of the Historic
Preservation Commission finds that a Preservation Incentive Certificate should
be granted, the Certificate shall be issued by the Village Manager or his or
her designee.
      2.   For applications requesting Preservation Incentives in the form of
grants or rebates, as detailed in Section
14-7-4, the vote of the Historic Preservation Commission shall be advisory, and
a recommendation shall be forwarded to the Board of Trustees. If the Historic
Preservation Commission does not recommend approval of an application
requesting a grant or a rebate, with at least four (4) affirmative votes, the
application is denied and will not proceed to the Board of Trustees. Upon
receipt of a recommendation from the Historic Preservation Commission, the
affirmative vote of four (4) or more members of the Board of Trustees is
required for approval of a Preservation Incentive Certificate involving a grant
or rebate. The Board of Trustees approval of such grant or rebate shall specify
the specific amount approved in the case of a grant or number of approved years
in the case of a Property Tax Rebate. Upon Board of Trustees approval, a
Preservation Incentive Certificate shall be issued by the Village Manager or
his or her designee.
      3.   Final Determinations of the Historic Preservation Commission on a
Preservation Incentive Certificate may be appealed to the Board of Trustees by
filing a request for an appeal within ten (10) days of the denial. Within sixty
(60) days following the receipt of an appeal, the Board of Trustees shall
either grant the Preservation Incentive Certificate, affirm its denial, or
remand the matter back to the Historic Preservation Commission for further
proceedings.
      4.   The Historic Preservation Commission or the Board of Trustees, as
applicable, may impose reasonable conditions on the issuance of a Preservation
Incentive Certificate.
   H.   Program Agreement Required. No Preservation Incentive shall be made
available unless the Applicant, following a Final Determination, enters into a
Program Agreement on a form previously developed by staff and approved by the
Board of Trustees governing the terms and conditions of any Preservation
Incentive received. (Ord. O2022-27, 9-20-2022)

CHAPTER 99
ZONING
ARTICLE I. TITLE AND PURPOSES
SECTION:
1-101: Title
1-102: Authority And Purposes
Sec. 1-101: Title:
This document shall be known, and may be referred to, as the HINSDALE ZONING
CODE.
Sec. 1-102: Authority and purposes:
This Code is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the Village by the
Illinois Municipal Code for the following purposes.
   A.   Overall purpose. The overall purpose of this Code is to maintain
Hinsdale as one of the nation's finest residential suburbs by preserving and
enhancing its historic character as a community comprised principally of well-
maintained single family residential neighborhoods and small, thriving business
areas oriented to serve the day-to-day needs of local residents.
   B.   Land use patterns. The purposes of this Code related to land use
patterns are to:
      1.   Implement and foster the goals and policies of the Village's
Official Comprehensive Plan; and
      2.   Establish a rational pattern of land uses and encourage the most
appropriate use of individual parcels of land in the Village; and
      3.   Encourage compatibility between different land uses; and
      4.   Encourage and promote detached single family homes as the principal
land use in the Village; and
      5.   Limit the bulk and density of new and existing structures to
preserve the existing scale of development in the Village; and
      6.   Provide for the gradual elimination of non-conforming uses that
adversely affect the character and value of permitted development; and
      7.   Protect the scale and character of the existing residential,
business, commercial, and office development areas of the Village from the
encroachment of incompatible uses; and
      8.   Encourage and enhance the preservation of natural resources,
aesthetic amenities, and natural features; and
      9.   Secure adequate natural light, clean air, privacy, a safe
environment, and convenience of access to property; and
      10.   Promote and protect the public health, safety, morals, and the
general welfare of the Village.
   C.   Public infrastructure. The purposes of this Code related to public
infrastructure are to:
      1.   Facilitate the most efficient use of existing and planned public
facilities and utilities; and
      2.   Protect existing public facilities and utilities from being
overloaded due to excess development; and
      3.   Protect and enhance a pattern of interconnected streets and highways
that is unified, integrated, safe, effective, and efficient; and
      4.   Protect residential streets from degradation by non-residential
traffic; and
      5.   Reduce congestion and promote safety on streets and highways by
limiting traffic generation through the control of land use intensity; and
      6.   Avoid or lessen the hazards of flooding and storm water accumulation
and run-off; and
      7.   Establish and regulate set-back lines along streets and highways,
property lines, and storm flood water runoff channels or basins.
   D.   Justifiable expectations and taxable value. The purposes of this Code
related to justifiable expectations and taxable value are to:
      1.   Protect and respect the justifiable reliance of existing residents,
businesspeople, and taxpayers on the continuation of existing, established land
use patterns; and

provisions of this Code; and

Code.
ARTICLE II. ZONING DISTRICTS AND OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
SECTION:
2-101: Establishment Of Zoning Districts
2-102: Interpretation Of District Sequence
2-103: Zoning Map
2-104: Annexed Land
Sec. 2-101: Establishment of zoning districts:
To carry out the purposes of this Code, the Village is hereby divided into the
following zoning districts:
   A.   Single family residential districts (Article III)
      R-1 - Single Family Residential District
      R-2 - Single Family Residential District
      R-3 - Single Family Residential District
      R-4 - Single Family Residential District
   B.   Multiple family residential districts (Article IV)
      R-5 - Multiple Family Residential District
      R-6 - Multiple Family Residential District
   C.   Business districts (Article V)
      B-1 - Community Business District
      B-2 - Central Business District
      B-3 - General Business District
   D.   Office districts (Article VI)
      O-1 - Specialty Office District
      O-2 - Limited Office District
      O-3 - General Office District
   E.   Special districts (Article VII)
      HS - Health Services District
      OS - Open Space District
      IB - Institutional Buildings District
   F.   Overlay districts (Article VIII)
DR - Design Review Overlay District
Sec. 2-102: Interpretation of district sequence:
   A.   General rule. This Code rejects as outdated and inappropriate the
concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and, except as noted
below, is based on the concept that each district should be designed to
accomplish a specific purpose, to encourage a particular type of development,
and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible
types of development.
   B.   Special rule. Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is
recognized that when different districts are juxtaposed, their differing
characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that
might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this Code recognizes the
concept of "more restrictive" and "less restrictive" districts. For this
purpose, the districts established by this Code shall be considered "more
restrictive" or "less restrictive" in accordance with the following rules:
      1.   The R-1 District shall be deemed to be the most restrictive
residential district and the R-6 District shall be deemed to be the least
restrictive residential district, and the residential districts shall be deemed
to become less restrictive as the district number increases.
      2.   The residential districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive
than any nonresidential district except the Open Space District.
      3.   The business and office districts shall be deemed to become less
restrictive as the district number increases.
      4.   The Health Services District shall be deemed to be less restrictive
than the office districts.
      5.   The Open Space District shall be deemed to be more restrictive than
any other district.
      6.   The Institutional Buildings District shall be deemed to be more
restrictive than the office districts but less restrictive than any residential
district.
      7. Overlay Districts shall not be considered in determining the
restrictiveness of the underlying district.
Sec. 2-103: Zoning map:
   A.   Map incorporated. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts
established by this Code are as shown on a map entitled "Zoning Map of the
Village of Hinsdale, Illinois," hereafter referred to as the Zoning Map, which
is by this reference incorporated as part of this Code. All notations,
references, and other information shown on the Zoning Map, and all amendments
thereto, shall be as much a part of this Code as if specifically set forth and
literally described herein.
   B.   Omitted land. It is the intent of this Code that the entire area of the
Village, including all land and water areas, be included in the districts
established by this Code. Any area lying within the Village but not shown on
the Zoning Map as being included in such a district shall be deemed to be, and
it is hereby, classified in the R-1 Single Family Residential District.
   C.   District boundaries. In the event that any uncertainty exists with
respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
      1.   The district boundaries are the center lines of tollways,
expressways, highways, streets, alleys, waterways, railroads, and other rights-
of-way unless otherwise indicated. When the designation of a boundary line on
the Zoning Map coincides with the location of any such right-of-way, the center
line of such right-of-way shall be construed to be the boundary of such
district.
      2.   When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot line, such lot line
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
      3.   When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way or lot line, the district boundary shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
   D.   Maintenance and availability of official zoning map. The official copy
of the Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Village Manager and shall be
available for public inspection during Village business hours at the Village
Memorial Building. Any amendment to zoning district boundaries or any change in
any other information shown on the Zoning Map made by amendment to this Code
shall be indicated on the official copy of the Zoning Map.
   E.   Mapping of parcels affected by court decrees. Parcels of land affected
by court decrees shall be shown on the Zoning Map in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection
12-106B of this Code.
   F.   Availability of zoning map. A revised, up-to-date copy of the Zoning
Map, certified as to being inclusive of all amendments and drawn to a
convenient scale, shall be published at least once annually and made available
for sale at the Village Memorial Building.
Sec. 2-104: Annexed land:
   A.   Annexation of land. All land annexed to the Village after the effective
date of this Code shall be classified automatically upon such annexation in the
R-1 Single Family Residential District. The owner of any land proposed to be
annexed to the Village shall file, with the petition for annexation, an
application for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance pursuant to Section 11-301
of this Code. In the case of an involuntary annexation, the Village Manager
shall complete the required application.
   B.   Application for different classification. When any land is classified
pursuant to this Section, it shall remain so classified unless and until an
application to amend such classification is filed and granted pursuant to
Sections
11-301 and
11-601 of this Code. Such application may be filed prior to or
contemporaneously with the annexation of the land in question.
ARTICLE III. SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
SECTION:
3-101: Purposes
3-102: Permitted Uses
3-103: Accessory Structures And Uses
3-104: Home Occupations
3-105: Temporary Uses
3-106: Special Uses
3-107: Parking And Loading Requirements
3-108: Sign Regulations
3-109: Buffers And Landscaping
3-110: Bulk, Space, And Yard Requirements
Sec. 3-101: Purposes:
Four (4) zoning districts are provided for single-family residential
development. The single-family residential districts blend, in combination with
the multiple-family residential districts described in article IV of this Code,
to provide a reasonable range of opportunity for the development and
preservation of housing types consistent with the existing residential
character of the Village.
The single-family districts provide for a limited range of housing densities
consistent with the Village's established residential neighborhoods. The R-
1 and R-2 Districts allow for lower density residential use and large lot
sizes. The R-3 and R-4 Districts allow for somewhat higher density residential
use and smaller lot sizes.
Taken as a whole, the single-family district regulations are intended to
perpetuate the existing high quality residential character of the Village by
preserving established neighborhoods and encouraging new residential
development consistent with the overall character of the Village. Only service
uses that are compatible with the single- family residential character of each
zoning district are allowed in addition to the permitted residential uses.
(1991 Code)
Sec. 3-102: Permitted Uses:
The following use and no other is permitted as of right in the single-family
residential districts: Single-family detached dwellings. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-103: Accessory Structures And Uses:
Accessory structures and uses are permitted in all single-family residential
districts subject to the provisions of section
9-101 of this Code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-104: Home Occupations:
Home occupations are permitted in all single-family residential districts
subject to the provisions of section
9-102 of this Code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-105: Temporary Uses:
Temporary uses are permitted in all single-family residential districts subject
to the provisions of section
9-103 of this Code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-106: Special Uses:
   Except as specifically limited in the following paragraphs, the following
uses may be permitted in any single-family residential district subject to the
issuance of a special use permit as provided in section
11-602 of this Code and subject to the additional standards hereinafter set
forth:
   A.   Public utility stations, subject to the following additional standards:
      1.   Structure Appearance And Screening: All buildings and structures
either shall have exteriors which give the appearance of a structure permitted
in the district where located or shall comply with the buffer and landscape
requirements applicable to nondwelling uses abutting a residential use pursuant
to subsection
9-107 F of this Code.
      2.   Safety Fencing: All such uses shall be fenced where any hazard to

for less than five (5) years, the building that previously sat on such lot
shall be included, and excluding the highest and lowest setbacks for buildings
on developed lots on such frontage and all lots containing nonresidential
principal buildings or structures; provided, however, that no such front or
corner side yard shall be permitted to be less than twenty five feet (25') in
the R-1 and R-2 districts and twenty feet (20') in the R-3 and R-4 districts.
When a lot has a front or corner side yard located on a frontage in which less
than fifty percent (50%) of the lots have already been developed, the front or

average of the setbacks of the buildings on each of the developed lots and the
required front or corner side yard in the zoning district for each of the
undeveloped lots, including the existing building on the subject lot, which if
vacant for less than five (5) years, the building that previously sat on such
lot shall be included, and excluding the highest and lowest setbacks for
buildings on developed lots on such frontage and all lots containing
nonresidential principal buildings or structures; provided, however, that no
such front or corner side yard shall be permitted to be less than twenty five
feet (25') in the R-1 and R-2 districts and twenty feet (20') in the R-3 and R-
4 districts. When a lot has a front or corner side yard located on a frontage
that contains three (3) or less lots, the front or corner side yard applicable
to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of the setbacks of all
principal structures on such frontage, including the existing building on the
subject lot, which if vacant for less than five (5) years, the building that
previously sat on such lot shall be included, and excluding all lots containing
nonresidential principal buildings or structures. When determining a front or
corner side yard required pursuant to this subsection, all measurements of
setbacks of existing buildings shall exclude all encroachments in front or
corner side yards by covered, unenclosed porches authorized by subsection I5 of
this section. When a through lot is located on a frontage where fifty percent
(50%) or more of the total number of lots on the frontage are through lots, the
front yard that is opposite the front yard toward which the front of the
principal dwelling is oriented shall be fifty percent (50%) of the average
front yard as determined under this subsection; provided, however, that no such
front yard shall be permitted to be less than thirty five feet (35').
      9.   Side And Rear Yard Regulations For Accessory Structures And Uses:

when located within the rear twenty percent (20%) of the lot shall not be
required to maintain an interior side or rear yard in excess of two feet (2');
provided, however, that when the rear yard of such lot abuts the side yard of
an adjacent lot, then detached accessory structures and uses shall not be
located closer than six feet (6') from said side yard, and provided further,
however, that the exception provided by this subsection shall not apply to
residential recreational facilities or antennas and antenna support structures.
No accessory structure or use, or combination of such structures or uses, other
than permitted accessory parking garages, located within an otherwise required
side or rear yard pursuant to this subsection shall occupy more than thirty

      10.   Corner And Interior Side Yard Adjustment: The required corner side
yard in the R-3 and R-4 districts may be reduced by one foot (1') for each foot
of additional interior side yard provided in excess of the applicable minimum
interior side yard requirement; provided, however, that no such corner side
yard shall be reduced to a size less than twenty feet (20').
      11.   Rear Yard Regulation For Decks: Decks shall not be required to
maintain a rear yard in excess of twenty five feet (25') in the R-1 and R-
2 districts nor in excess of fifteen feet (15') in the R-3 and R-4 districts.

requirement shall not apply to prevent development of a total of two thousand
eight hundred (2,800) square feet of gross building floor area.
      13.   Floor Area Bonus For Detached Garages: In determining the floor
area ratio for lots having a detached garage and no other garage, exclude one-
half (1/2) of the area of the detached garage, but not more than two hundred

porch to which the exemption applies lies between the widest apart side
building lines of the dwelling or lies in front of the front building line of
the dwelling extended or 5) in the case of a corner side yard, the portion of
the porch to which the exemption applies lies between the frontmost and the
rearmost building lines of the dwelling or lies in front of the corner side
building line of the dwelling extended; provided, however, that this exemption
shall not exceed a total of two hundred (200) square feet for any zoning lot.

4-112: Special Development And Use Regulations
Sec. 4-101: Purposes:
Two (2) zoning districts are provided for multiple-family residential
development. Only selected service uses that are compatible with the
residential character of these zoning districts are allowed in addition to
permitted residential uses.
The R-5 district is designed principally in recognition of the existence of
certain multiple-family uses on property developed under county zoning
regulations and subsequently annexed into the village. The R-5 district also is
intended to function as a transition between single-family detached and other
zoning districts and to provide for lower density multiple-family building
types, which may result in higher densities than in single-family developments.
The R-6 district allows for taller buildings and higher densities to
accommodate multiple-family structures developed under DuPage County zoning
regulations and subsequently annexed into the village. The permitted use and
bulk regulations are designed to encourage a moderate density residential area
including alternate housing types in a suburban environment. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-102: Mapping Restrictions:
   A.   R-5 District: The R-5 district shall be mapped only in areas where it
is appropriate to accommodate existing multiple-family development or where the
flexibility offered by use of alternate low density housing types facilitates a
logical transition between an area of established single-family detached
housing and adjacent property zoned in less restrictive zoning districts, or on
existing large tracts that are inappropriate for classification in a more
restrictive district and that offer the opportunity for the creation of
significant amounts of usable open space through the use of alternate low
density housing types, or as an expansion onto abutting property of an existing
R-5 district.
   B.   R-6 District: The R-6 district is designed to accommodate higher
density multiple-family uses existing in the village on the effective date of
this code, most of which were developed under county zoning regulations and
subsequently annexed into the village. The R-6 district is inappropriate for
mapping, and shall not be mapped, in any other area of the village. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-103: Permitted Uses:
The following uses and no others are permitted as of right in the multiple-
family residential districts:
   A.   Single-family detached dwellings.
   B.   Townhouse (single-family attached) dwellings, but not more than eight
(8) attached dwelling units in any one building.
   C.   Two-family dwellings.
   D.   Multiple-family dwellings, but only in the R-6 district. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-104: Accessory Structures And Uses:
Accessory structures and uses are permitted in all multiple-family residential
districts subject to the provisions of section
9-101 of this code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-105: Home Occupations:
Home occupations are permitted in all multiple-family residential districts
subject to the provisions of section
9-102 of this code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-106: Temporary Uses:
Temporary uses are permitted in all multiple-family residential districts
subject to the provisions of section
9-103 of this code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-107: Special Uses:
Except as specifically limited in the following subsections, the following uses
may be permitted in all multiple-family residential districts subject to the
issuance of a special use permit as provided in section
11-602 of this code and subject to the additional standards hereinafter set
forth:

certain source of continuous and sufficient funds to provide for the operation
and maintenance of such facility in accordance with the representations of the
application and the various standards applicable to such facility by reason of
this Code and other laws and regulations.
   D.   Planned developments, subject to the special procedures and standards
set forth in Section
11-603 of this Code and subject to the additional standard that uses in planned
developments in each multiple family residential district shall be limited to
the permitted, special, accessory, and temporary uses as otherwise permitted in
that district.
   E.   Transitional service facilities for up to six transitional service
facility residents, subject to the following additional standards:
      1.   Supervision. Every transitional service facility shall provide
qualified and experienced supervisory personnel, in sufficient numbers and
during sufficient and appropriate hours of the day and night, to meet all
standards of any agency responsible for the licensing or regulation of the
transitional service facility and such additional services as may be required
by the Board of Trustees. The special use permit shall specifically establish
minimum standards for supervision. The name and telephone number of at least
one person having direct responsibility for the operation of the facility shall
be listed in the Hinsdale telephone directory under the name of the facility.
      2.   Concentration. No transitional service facility shall be located
within one-quarter mile of any other existing transitional service facility,

   G.    Exceptions And Explanatory Notes:
      1.   Height Exceptions:
         (a)   Adjustment For Senior Citizen Housing: The plan commission may
recommend and the board of trustees may authorize an increase of the maximum
permitted height to three (3) stories or thirty five feet (35'), whichever is
less, in the R-5 district or six (6) stories or sixty feet (60'), whichever is
less, in the R-6 district when approving a special use permit for a senior
citizen housing development.
         (b)   Personal Wireless Services: Personal wireless services antennas,
with or without antenna support structures, and related electronic equipment
and equipment structures, may extend to the following heights:
            (i)   Omnidirectional or whip antennas may extend to a height of
fifteen feet (15') above the highest point of the roof of the building or
structure to which they are attached;
            (ii)   Directional or panel antennas may not extend above the
highest point of the building or structure to which they are attached or more
than two feet (2') from the exterior of any wall or roof of the building or
structure to which they are attached; and
            (iii)   Related electronic equipment and equipment structures shall
not exceed applicable district height limitations.
      2.   Nonconforming Lots: See section
10-105 of this code for lot requirements with respect to legal nonconforming
lots of record.
      3.   Density Adjustment For Senior Citizen Housing And Personal Care
Facilities:
         (a)   Authority To Approve Increased Density: The plan commission may
recommend and the board of trustees may authorize a reduction of the minimum
lot size per dwelling unit requirement, and thus an increase in the overall
density of development, when approving a special use permit for a senior
citizen housing development in a multiple-family district.
         (b)   Maximum Permissible Adjustment: No such adjustment shall reduce
the lot size per dwelling unit requirement to less than two thousand (2,000)
square feet unless in conjunction with a special use for a planned development
that includes special use permit applications for both a personal care facility
and senior citizen housing, and provided that the structures that are the
subject of the application were constructed prior to the year 1980.
         (c)   Standard For Adjustment: No such adjustment shall be recommended
or authorized except on the basis of a finding that the adjustment will not
result in any undue congestion in or adverse impact on the surrounding area. In
determining the amount of any such adjustment to be recommended or authorized,
consideration shall be given to:
            (i)   The development's excellence in satisfying the standards set
forth in subsection
4-107C of this article; and
            (ii)   The extent to which public or private subsidies are provided
to allow some or all of the proposed dwelling units to be occupied by
individuals of low or moderate income within the meaning of section 103(b)(4)
(A) of the internal revenue code of 1954, as amended.
      4.   Calculation Of Nursing Or Personal Care Facility Density: Every
patient bed in a nursing or personal care facility, whether in a private,
semiprivate, or dormitory room, shall be counted as one dwelling unit. In
addition, any dwelling unit occupied or available for occupancy by staff of the
nursing or personal care facility shall be counted as a dwelling unit.
      5.   Clustering In Planned Developments: In planned developments, minimum
lot size per unit requirements are intended only as a limit on overall
development density and not as a requirement that each individual unit be
placed on a lot of the specified size. In other words, units may be clustered
together so long as sufficient common open space is provided within the
development to meet the average minimum lot size requirement of the development
taken as a whole.
      6.   Lot Size Adjustments In Planned Developments: No adjustment of the
minimum lot size per dwelling unit requirement pursuant to subsection
11-603H of this code shall reduce the lot size per dwelling unit requirement to
less than four thousand (4,000) square feet in the R-5 district and two
thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in the R-6 district for a planned
development in a multiple-family district. No such adjustment shall be
recommended or authorized except on the basis of the development's excellence
in achieving the purposes for which planned developments may be approved
pursuant to subsection
11-603B of this code and in satisfying the standards applicable to such
developments as set forth in subsection
11-603E of this code. In determining whether such excellence has been shown,
special consideration shall be given to the following factors:
         (a)   The amount of usable open space; and
         (b)   The extent of land dedication for public building sites and open
space; and
         (c)   The quality and extent of landscaping, including special
elements such as water features and public art; and
         (d)   The quality and extent of recreational facilities such as golf
courses; swimming pools, tennis courts, playgrounds, and other residential
recreational facilities; bicycle, hiking, and jogging trails; and community
centers; and
         (e)   The quality of design of vehicular circulation elements and
parking lots and areas; and
         (f)   The care taken to maximize energy conservation in site design,
building design, and building systems; and
         (g)   The quality of roof design and finishes in terms of consistency
with an attractive residential setting and the avoidance of flat roofs.
      7.   Special Yard And Setback Requirements In Planned Developments:
Special perimeter open space, setback, and spacing requirements for planned
developments are set forth in subsections 11-603E2(f) and E2(g) of this code.
Such requirements shall not be waived under any circumstances.
      8.   Visibility Across Corners: Any other provision of this code to the
contrary notwithstanding, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, allowed to
grow, or maintained on any corner lot in any residential district in violation
of the provisions of title 7, chapter 1, article D of the village code.
      9.   Special Setbacks For Signs: Special setbacks established for some
signs by subsections 9-106F, H, I, and J of this code shall control over the
yards and setbacks established in the table.
      10.   Specified Structures And Uses In Required Yards: The following
structures and uses, except as limited below, may be located in any required
yard:
         (a)   Statuary, arbors, trellises, and ornamental light standards
having a height of ten feet (10') or less; and
         (b)   Eaves and gutters projecting not more than three feet (3') from
an exterior wall; and
         (c)   Awnings, canopies, bay windows, and balconies projecting not
more than three feet (3') into a front or rear yard from an exterior wall for a
distance not more than one-third (1/3) of the length of such wall or two feet
(2') into a side yard from an exterior wall for a distance not more than one-
fourth (1/4) of the length of such wall; provided that such projections shall
come entirely within planes drawn from the main corners of the building at an
interior angle of twenty two and one-half degrees (221/2°) with the wall in
question; and
         (d)   Chimneys, flues, belt courses, leaders, sills, pilasters,
lintels, ornamental features, cornices, and the like projecting not more than
two feet (2') from an exterior wall; and
         (e)   Outside stairways projecting from an exterior wall not more than
three feet (3') and having a height of four feet (4') or less; and
         (f)   Flagpoles; and
         (g)   Nonmechanical laundry drying equipment, except in front yards;
and
         (h)   Terraces; and
         (i)   Recreational devices, but only freestanding basketball standards
and no other recreational devices in any front yard; and
         (j)   Fences, walls, and hedges, subject to the limitations of section
9-107 of this code; and
         (k)   Driveways, subject to the limitations of subsection
9-104C of this code.
      11.   Platted Building Lines: See subsection
12-101F of this code.
      12.   Front And Corner Side Yard Adjustment Next To Existing Structures:
When a lot abuts, on both sides, lots that have already been developed, the
front yard applicable to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of
the setbacks of the buildings on the two (2) abutting lots; provided, however,
that no such front yard shall be less than twenty five feet (25'). When a lot
abuts a lot that has already been developed on one side and a vacant lot or
street on the other side, the front or corner side yard applicable to such lot
shall be determined by taking the average of the setback of the building on the
abutting developed lot and the required front yard in the zoning district;
provided, however, that no such front or corner side yard shall be less than
twenty five feet (25').
      13.   Side And Rear Yard Regulations For Accessory Structures And Uses:
Parking areas wherever located and other detached accessory structures and uses
when located within the rear twenty percent (20%) of the lot shall not be
required to maintain an interior side or rear yard in excess of two feet (2');
provided, however, that when the rear yard of such lot abuts the side yard of
an adjacent lot, then detached accessory structures and uses shall not be
located closer than six feet (6') from said side yard, and provided further,
however, that the exception provided by this paragraph shall not apply to
residential recreational facilities, stables, or antennas and antenna support
structures, and provided further, however, that no accessory structure or use,
or combination of such structures or uses, located within an otherwise required
side or rear yard pursuant to this paragraph shall occupy more than thirty
percent (30%) of such required yard.
      14.   Application Of Side Yard Requirements To Townhouse Dwellings: In
the case of townhouse dwellings, side yard requirements shall apply to the
entire structure and not to individual dwelling units therein.
      15.   Rear Yard Regulation For Decks: Decks shall not be required to
maintain a rear yard in excess of fifteen feet (15').
      16.   Exception For Decks: Coverage by decks shall not be included in
determining the amount of building coverage.
      17.   Exception For Specified Accessory Structures: This limitation shall
not apply to attached accessory structures, nor to air conditioning units,
antennas, or antenna support structures, nor to any such accessory structure
protected by a fire separation wall approved by the village manager.
      18.   Buildings For Senior Citizen Housing And Personal Care Facilities:
Separate buildings connected by atriums and/or enclosed walkways which were
constructed prior to the year 2010 shall not create or otherwise be considered
a single structure. (Ord. 97-4, §§2B, C, 3-4-1997; Ord. O2011-47, 10-24-2011)

Sec. 5-101: Purposes:
Three (3) zoning districts are provided for business and commercial uses. When
taken together, these districts are intended to permit development of property
for the full range of business and commercial uses needed to serve the citizens
of Hinsdale and surrounding areas in a suburban setting.
The districts, while distinct, permit a harmonious spectrum of general suburban
shopping and service opportunities, ranging from a relatively low intensity (B-
1), through a higher intensity business zone intended to accommodate local
shopping needs in a "downtown" setting (B-2), to a more generalized commercial
district designed for established areas of heavier vehicular traffic (B-3).
Specifically, the B-1 community business district is intended to serve the
everyday shopping needs of village residents as well as to provide
opportunities for specialty shops attractive to wider suburban residential
community around the village. It permits uses that are necessary to satisfy
most basic, frequently occurring shopping needs. Also allowed are compatible
uses that, while not used as frequently, would be desirably located in close
proximity to potential users. This district is designed to accommodate
development of community shopping centers with planned off street parking and
loading as well as existing individual shops or small groups of local stores.
The district is normally located on primary or secondary thoroughfares, is
relatively small in size, and has bulk standards that provide for compatibility
with nearby residential uses.
The B-2 central business district is intended to serve the entire Hinsdale
suburban community with a wide variety of retail and service uses. It is
intended to serve as the primary shopping area of the village. This district is
located in the center of the village, adjacent to commuter facilities, and at
the convergence of primary thoroughfares. The bulk standards are intended to
reflect the generally more intense development of property in this area.
The B-3 general business district is intended to serve the Hinsdale suburban
community with a full range of locally oriented business uses commonly located
along established traffic routes. (1991 Code)

colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the
building.
      7.   Equipment Enclosures: All electronic and other related equipment and
appurtenances necessary for the operation of any personal wireless services
antenna shall, whenever possible, be located within a lawfully preexisting
structure or completely below grade. When a new structure is required to house
such equipment, such structure shall be harmonious with, and blend with, the
natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such structure.
      8.   Licenses And Permits: The operator of every personal wireless
services antenna shall submit to the village manager copies of all licenses and
permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the
design, construction, location and operation of such antenna and shall maintain
such licenses and permits and provide evidence of renewal or extension thereof
when granted.

antenna support structure shall comply with all plans approved by the village.
      10.   Limited To Applicant: Every ordinance granting approval of a
special use permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support
structure shall state that any assignment or transfer of the special use permit
or any of the rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of the board
of trustees.
      11.   Term Limitation: Every ordinance granting approval of a special use
permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support structure
may provide that:
         (a)   Where the provider of personal wireless services is not the
owner of the land on which such antenna or structure is located, the term of
the special use permit is limited to the term of the lease or other agreement
granting rights to use the land; and
         (b)   The special use permit shall be subject to review by the board
of trustees, at ten (10) year intervals, to determine whether the technology in
the provision of personal wireless services has changed such that the necessity
for the special permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or

Sec. 6-101: Purposes:
Three (3) zoning districts are provided for office development. The office
districts accommodate a range of suburban office space alternatives in keeping
with the residential and local business atmosphere in the village.
In the office districts, the combination of use regulations and varied bulk and
yard regulations is intended to:
   A.   Perpetuate the existing high quality character of the village by
preserving established office use areas while permitting only beneficial new
office development consistent with the overall character and land use patterns
of the existing village; and
   B.   Assure through height limits, setback and open space requirements, and
mapping decisions that all office development is compatible with the
residential scale of village; and
   C.   Implement through reasonable regulation the purposes and intent of this
code.
Specifically, the O-1 specialty office district is intended to provide for
small offices in the older areas of the village adjacent to the central
business areas where it is possible to retain the residential character and
appearance of the village and at the same time promote limited business
activity. The uses permitted are characterized by low traffic volume and
limited outdoor advertising. The regulations of the O-1 district are designed
to encourage the retention and renovation of sound existing structures and to
ensure that the office uses remain compatible with the residential uses while
permitting the area to maintain a distinctive residential character.
Replacement structures in the O-1 district also must have a residential
character and appearance. The O-1 district normally is small in size and
located to provide a transition between residential areas and less restricted
districts.
The O-2 limited office district is designed to provide for the general needs of
business and professional offices and related business uses on smaller sites in
scattered areas throughout the village. Bulk and height regulations encourage
development that is architecturally consistent with smaller sites and
compatible with nearby residential uses.
The O-3 general office district is provided to accommodate the needs of
business and professional offices and related business uses requiring a
somewhat wider range of office space with a somewhat higher intensity of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic movements. Bulk and height regulations are
consistent with a moderate amount of development. (1991 Code)
Sec. 6-102: O-3 District Mapping Restriction:
The O-3 district shall be mapped only on property lying north of Ogden Avenue
and east of York Road. (1991 Code)
Sec. 6-103: Permitted Uses:
The following uses and no others are permitted as of right in the office
districts indicated in the following table. In interpreting the use
designations, reference should be made to the "Standard Industrial
Classification Manual" (see appendix A) and section
11-501 of this code. SIC codes are given in parentheses following each use

lawfully preexisting antenna support structures or other lawfully preexisting
buildings or structures wherever possible. No special use permits authorizing
construction of a new antenna support structure or addition to or expansion of
an existing antenna support structure or existing building or structure shall
be authorized unless the applicant is able to demonstrate that no lawfully
preexisting antenna support structure or lawfully preexisting building or
structure is available, on commercially reasonable terms, and sufficient for
the location of an antenna necessary for the provision of personal wireless
services.
      2.   Design Of New Antenna Support Structures For Collocation: Unless
otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees for good cause shown, every new
personal wireless services antenna support structure, whether constructed as a
permitted or special use, shall be designed, constructed and installed to be of
a sufficient size and capacity to allow the location of additional personal
wireless services antennas to accommodate at least one additional personal
wireless service provider on such structure in the future. Any special use
permit for such a support structure may be conditioned upon the agreement of
the applicant to allow collocation of other personal wireless service providers
on commercially reasonable terms specified in such special use permit.
      3.   Tower Design: Every new personal wireless services antenna support
structure that is of a tower design shall:
         (a)   Be a monopole rather than latticework, unless otherwise
authorized by the board of trustees for good cause shown;
         (b)   Not be illuminated or have any signs installed thereon unless
otherwise required by federal law or regulations; and
         (c)   Be located at least twenty feet (20') from any other such
structure.
Any deck on such a tower shall be centered on the tower and shall have not more
than three (3) sides, with each side having dimensions that do not exceed five
feet (5') vertically and twelve feet (12') horizontally.
      4.   Sizes Of Antennas On Buildings: Antennas located on a lawfully
preexisting building shall not exceed the following dimensions:
         (a)   Omnidirectional or whip antennas shall not exceed three inches
(3") in diameter and fifteen feet (15') vertically; and
         (b)   Directional or panel antennas shall not exceed two feet (2')
horizontally and five feet (5') vertically.
      5.   Protection Against Climbing: Every personal wireless services
antenna and antenna support structure shall be protected against unauthorized
climbing or other access by the public.
      6.   Color: Every personal wireless services antenna and antenna support
structure shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and that blend
with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such antenna
and antenna support structures; provided, however, that directional or panel
antennas and omnidirectional or whip antennas located on the exterior of a
building that will also serve as an antenna support structure shall be of
colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the
building.
      7.   Equipment Enclosures: All electronic and other related equipment and
appurtenances necessary for the operation of any personal wireless services
antenna shall, whenever possible, be located within a lawfully preexisting
structure or completely below grade. When a new structure is required to house
such equipment, such structure shall be harmonious with, and blend with, the
natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such structure.
      8.   Licenses And Permits: The operator of every personal wireless
services antenna shall submit to the village manager copies of all licenses and
permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the
design, construction, location and operation of such antenna and shall maintain
such licenses and permits and provide evidence of renewal or extension thereof
when granted.
      9.   Compliance With Plans: Every personal wireless services antenna and
antenna support structure shall comply with all plans approved by the village.
      10.   Limited To Applicant: Every ordinance granting approval of a
special use permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support
structure shall state that any assignment or transfer of the special use permit
or any of the rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of the board
of trustees.
      11.   Term Limitation: Every ordinance granting approval of a special use
permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support structure
may provide that:
         (a)   Where the provider of personal wireless services is not the
owner of the land on which such antenna or structure is located, the term of
the special use permit is limited to the term of the lease or other agreement
granting rights to use the land; and
         (b)   The special use permit shall be subject to review by the board
of trustees, at ten (10) year intervals, to determine whether the technology in
the provision of personal wireless services has changed such that the necessity
for the special permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or
modified, and whether the special use permit should be modified or terminated
as a result of any such change.
      12.   Abandonment And Removal: When one or more antennas, an antenna
support structure, or related equipment are not operated for the provision of
personal wireless services for a continuous period of twelve (12) months or
more, such antenna, antenna support structure, or related equipment may be
deemed to be abandoned by the village. The owner of such an antenna, antenna
support structure, or related equipment shall remove such items within ninety
(90) days following the mailing of written notice that removal is required.
Such notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the village to such owner at the last known address of such
owner. If two (2) or more providers of personal wireless services use the
antenna support structure or related equipment to provide personal wireless
services, then the period of nonuse under this provision shall be measured from
the cessation of operation at the location of such antenna support structure or
related equipment by all such providers.
      13.   Additional Standards For Review: In addition to the special use
standards contained in subsection
11-602E, and the requirements of this subsection K, the following factors may
also be considered in the review of special use permit for personal wireless
services antennas, with or without antenna support structures, and related
electronic and equipment structures:
         (a)   Where the antenna support structure is a tower, the height
thereof, its proximity to residential structures and residential district
boundaries, and the design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating, or failing to reduce or eliminate, the visual obtrusiveness
thereof;
         (b)   The nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby property;
         (c)   The surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage; and
         (d)   The availability of suitable lawfully existing structures, as
described in subsections K1 and K2 of this section.
   L.   Depository And Nondepository Credit Institutions: The special use set
forth in subsection
6-106A1 of this article may be granted for a depository or drive-in
nondepository credit institution subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Limitation On Space: The board of trustees may impose a limitation
on: a) the maximum permissible square footage of the ground floor and b) the
maximum permissible street frontage of any building occupied by any new

institution on the vitality of business environment in the vicinity of the
institution.
      2.   Parking: Every new depository or non-depository credit institution
shall be required to provide all required parking on site notwithstanding any
provision of this code to the contrary.
      3.   Conditions: The board of trustees may impose on the special use such
conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this code as may be necessary or appropriate to limit the impact
of the use on the vitality of the business environment in the vicinity of the
institution and to prevent or minimize adverse effects of the use on property
and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property, on public facilities
and services, and on the aesthetics of the street frontage in the vicinity of
the building.
   M.   Drive-In Depository And Nondepository Credit Institutions: The special
use set forth in subsection
6-106A2 of this article shall be subject to the following additional
regulations:
      1.   Number Of Drive-In Lanes: No more than two (2) drive-in lanes shall
be permitted under any circumstances, including any drive-in lane for an
automatic teller machine. The board of trustees may further limit the number
of, or prohibit, drive-in lanes.
      2.   Location Of Drive-In Lanes: Drive-in lanes shall not be permitted in
any front or corner side yard; provided, however, only that a required access
drive aisle from the public street to the drive-in lanes may traverse a front
or corner side yard in a manner that minimizes the lot coverage within that
front or corner side yard.
      3.   Traffic Study: With every application for a special use for a drive-
in depository or nondepository credit institution, the applicant shall provide
a traffic study prepared by an expert transportation planning consultant.
      4.   Pedestrian Access To Automatic Teller Machines: Pedestrian access to
one or more automatic teller machines shall be provided at each drive-in
depository and nondepository credit institution, and pathways shall be provided
in a manner that keeps pedestrian access separate from vehicular drive-in

conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this code as may be necessary or appropriate to limit the impact
of the use on the vitality of the business environment in the vicinity of the
institution and to prevent or minimize adverse effects of the use on property
and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property, on public facilities
and services, and on the aesthetics of the street frontage in the vicinity of
the building.

antenna and antenna support structure shall be protected against unauthorized
climbing or other access by the public.
      5.   Color: Every personal wireless services antenna and antenna support
structure shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and that blend
with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such antenna
and antenna support structures; provided, however, that directional or panel
antennas and omnidirectional or whip antennas located on the exterior of a
building that will also serve as an antenna support structure shall be of
colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the
building.
      6.   Equipment Enclosures: All electronic and other related equipment and
appurtenances necessary for the operation of any personal wireless services
antenna shall, whenever possible, be located within a lawfully preexisting
structure or completely below grade. When a new structure is required to house

antenna support structure shall comply with all plans approved by the village.
      9.   Limited To Applicant: Every ordinance granting approval of a special
use permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support
structure shall state that any assignment or transfer of the special use permit
or any of the rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of the board
of trustees.
      10.   Abandonment And Removal: When one or more antennas, an antenna
support structure, or related equipment are not operated for the provision of
personal wireless services for a continuous period of twelve (12) months or
more, such antenna, antenna support structure, or related equipment may be
deemed to be abandoned by the village. The owner of such an antenna, antenna
support structure, or related equipment shall remove such items within ninety
(90) days following the mailing of written notice that removal is required.
Such notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the village to such owner at the last known address of such
owner. If two (2) or more providers of personal wireless services use the
antenna support structure or related equipment to provide personal wireless
services, then the period of nonuse under this provision shall be measured from
the cessation of operation at the location of such antenna support structure or
related equipment by all such providers. (Ord. 97-4, §5C, 3-4-1997)

structures, and related electronic equipment and equipment structures in the OS
District:
      1.   Location. Personal wireless services antennas shall be located on
lawfully pre-existing antenna support structures or other lawfully pre-existing
buildings or structures wherever possible. No special use permits authorizing
construction of a new antenna support structure or addition to or expansion of
an existing antenna support structure or existing building or structure shall
be authorized unless the applicant is able to demonstrate that no lawfully pre-
existing antenna support structure or lawfully pre-existing building or
structure is available, on commercially reasonable terms, and sufficient for
the location of an antenna necessary for the provision of personal wireless
services.
      2.   Design of new antenna support structures for co-location. Unless
otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees for good cause shown, every new
personal wireless services antenna support structure shall be designed,
constructed and installed to be of a sufficient size and capacity to allow the
location of additional personal wireless services antennas to accommodate at
least one additional personal wireless service provider on such structure in
the future. Any special use permit for such a support structure may be
conditioned upon the agreement of the applicant to allow co-location of other
personal wireless service providers on commercially reasonable terms specified
in such special use permit.
      3.   Tower design. Every new personal wireless services antenna support
structure that is of a tower design shall:
         (a)   Be a monopole rather than latticework, unless otherwise
authorized by the Board of Trustees for good cause shown;
         (b)   Not be illuminated or have any signs installed thereon unless
otherwise required by federal law or regulations; and
         (c)   Be located at least 20 feet from any other such structure.
Any deck on such a tower shall be centered on the tower and shall have not more
than three sides, with each side having dimensions that do not exceed five feet
vertically and 12 feet horizontally.
      4.   Sizes of antennas on buildings. Antennas located on a lawfully pre-
existing building shall not exceed the following dimensions:
         (a)   Omnidirectional or whip antennas shall not exceed three inches
in diameter and 15 feet vertically; and
         (b)   Directional or panel antennas shall not exceed two feet
horizontally and five feet vertically.

antenna and antenna support structure shall be protected against unauthorized
climbing by the public.
      6.   Color. Every personal wireless services antenna and antenna support
structure shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and that blend
with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such antenna
and antenna support structures; provided, however, that directional or panel
antennas and omnidirectional or whip antennas located on the exterior of a
building that will also serve as an antenna support structure shall be of
colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the
building.
      7.   Equipment enclosures. All electronic and other related equipment and
appurtenances necessary for the operation of any personal wireless services
antenna shall, whenever possible, be located within a lawfully pre- existing
structure or completely below grade. When a new structure is required to house
such equipment, such structure shall be harmonious with, and blend with, the
natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such structure.
      8.   Licenses and permits. The operator of every personal wireless
services antenna shall submit to the Village Manager copies of all licenses and
permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the
design, construction, location and operation of such antenna and shall maintain
such licenses and permits and provide evidence of renewal or extension thereof
when granted.
      9.   Compliance with plans. Every personal wireless services antenna and
antenna support structure shall comply with all plans approved by the Village.
      10.   Limited to applicant. Every ordinance granting approval of a
special use permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support
structure shall state that any assignment or transfer of the special use permit
or any of the rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of the Board
of Trustees.
      11.   Term limitation. Every ordinance granting approval of a special use
permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support structure
may provide that:
         (a)   Where the provider of personal wireless services is not the
owner of the land on which such antenna or structure is located, the term of
the special use permit is limited to the term of the lease or other agreement
granting rights to use the land; and
         (b)   The special use permit shall be subject to review by the Board
of Trustees, at ten year intervals, to determine whether the technology in the
provision of personal wireless services has changed such that the necessity for
the special permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or modified,
and whether the special use permit should be modified or terminated as a result
of any such change.
      12.   Abandonment and removal. When one or more antennas, an antenna
support structure, or related equipment are not operated for the provision of
personal wireless services for a continuous period of 12 months or more, such
antenna, antenna support structure, or related equipment may be deemed to be
abandoned by the Village. The owner of such an antenna, antenna support
structure, or related equipment shall remove such items within 90 days
following the mailing of written notice that removal is required. Such notice
shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the
Village to such owner at the last known address of such owner. If two or more
providers of personal wireless services use the antenna support structure or
related equipment to provide personal wireless services, then the period of
non-use under this provision shall be measured from the cessation of operation
at the location of such antenna support structure or related equipment by all
such providers.
      13.   Additional standards for review. In addition to the special use
standards contained in Subsection
11-602E, and the requirements of this Subsection B, the following factors may
also be considered in the review of special use permit for personal wireless
services antennas, with or without antenna support structures, and related
electronic and equipment structures:
         (a)   Where the antenna support structure is a tower, the height
thereof, its proximity to residential structures and residential district
boundaries, and the design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating, or failing to reduce or eliminate, the visual obtrusiveness
thereof;
         (b)   The nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby property;
         (c)   The surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage; and
         (d)   The availability of suitable lawfully existing structures, as
described in subsections B1 and B2 of this section. (Ord. 97-4, §6D, 3-4-1997)

services.
      2.   Design Of New Antenna Support Structures For Collocation: Unless
otherwise authorized by the board of trustees for good cause shown, every new
personal wireless services antenna support structure, whether constructed as a
permitted or special use, shall be designed, constructed and installed to be of
a sufficient size and capacity to allow the location of additional personal
wireless services antennas to accommodate at least one additional personal
wireless services provider on such structure in the future. Any special use
permit for such a support structure may be conditioned upon the agreement of
the applicant to allow collocation of other personal wireless services
providers on commercially reasonable terms specified in such special use
permit.
      3.   Tower Design: Every new personal wireless services antenna support
structure that is of a tower design shall:
         (a)   Be a monopole rather than lattice-work, unless otherwise
authorized by the board of trustees for good cause shown;
         (b)   Not be illuminated or have any signs installed thereon unless
otherwise required by federal law or regulations; and
         (c)   Be located at least twenty feet (20') from any other such
structure.
Any deck on such a tower shall be centered on the tower and shall have not more
than three (3) sides, with each side having dimensions that do not exceed five
feet (5') vertically and twelve feet (12') horizontally.
      4.   Sizes Of Antennas On Buildings: Antennas located on a lawfully
preexisting building shall not exceed the following dimensions:
         (a)   Omnidirectional or whip antennas shall not exceed three inches
(3") in diameter and fifteen feet (15') vertically; and
         (b)   Directional or panel antennas shall not exceed two feet (2')
horizontally and five feet (5') vertically.
      5.   Protection Against Climbing: Every personal wireless services
antenna and antenna support structure shall be protected against unauthorized
climbing or other access by the public.
      6.   Color: Every personal wireless services antenna and antenna support
structure shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and that blend
with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such antenna
and antenna support structures; provided, however, that directional or panel
antennas and omnidirectional or whip antennas located on the exterior of a
building that will also serve as an antenna support structure shall be of
colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the
building.
      7.   Equipment Enclosures: All electronic and other related equipment and
appurtenances necessary for the operation of any personal wireless services
antenna shall, whenever possible, be located within a lawfully preexisting
structure or completely below grade. When a new structure is required to house
such equipment, such structure shall be harmonious with, and blend with, the
natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such structure.
      8.   Licenses And Permits: The operator of every personal wireless
services antenna shall submit to the village manager copies of all licenses and
permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the
design, construction, location and operation of such antenna and shall maintain
such licenses and permits and provide evidence of renewal or extension thereof
when granted.
      9.   Compliance With Plans: Every personal wireless services antenna and
antenna support structure shall comply with all plans approved by the village.
      10.   Limited To Applicant: Every ordinance granting approval of a
special use permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support
structure shall state that any assignment or transfer of the special use permit
or any of the rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of the board
of trustees.
      11.   Term Limitation: Every ordinance granting approval of a special use
permit for a personal wireless services antenna or antenna support structure
may provide that:
         (a)   Where the provider of personal wireless services is not the
owner of the land on which such antenna or structure is located, the term of
the special use permit is limited to the term of the lease or other agreement
granting rights to use the land; and
         (b)   The special use permit shall be subject to review by the board
of trustees, at ten (10) year intervals, to determine whether the technology in
the provision of personal wireless services has changed such that the necessity
for the special permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or
modified, and whether the special use permit should be modified or terminated
as a result of any such change.
      12.   Abandonment And Removal: When one or more antennas, an antenna
support structure, or related equipment are not operated for the provision of
personal wireless services for a continuous period of twelve (12) months or
more, such antenna, antenna support structure, or related equipment may be
deemed to be abandoned by the village. The owner of such an antenna, antenna
support structure, or related equipment shall remove such items within ninety
(90) days following the mailing of written notice that removal is required.
Such notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the village to such owner at the last known address of such
owner. If two (2) or more providers of personal wireless services use the
antenna support structure or related equipment to provide personal wireless
services, then the period of nonuse under this provision shall be measured from
the cessation of operation at the location of such antenna support structure or
related equipment by all such providers.
      13.   Additional Standards For Review: In addition to the special use
standards contained in subsection
11-602E of this code, and the requirements of this subsection B, the following
factors may also be considered in the review of a special use permit for
personal wireless services antennas, with or without antenna support
structures, and related electronic and equipment structures:
         (a)   Where the antenna support structure is a tower, the height
thereof, its proximity to residential structures and residential district
boundaries, and the design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating, or failing to reduce or eliminate, the visual obtrusiveness
thereof;
         (b)   The nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby property;
         (c)   The surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage; and
         (d)   The availability of suitable lawfully existing structures, as
described in subsections B1 and B2 of this section. (Ord. 97-4, §7E, 3-4-1997)

PART I. DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT
Sec. 8-101: Purposes:
The regulations of the DR Design Review Overlay District are intended to
promote the historic and architectural qualities of the Village and thereby
preserve the distinctive character of the Village. Various areas of the
Village, such as the area around the old Graue Mill and the downtown business
district among others, have special historical, cultural, and design
significance. These areas contain historic or unique sites deserving
protection. Many areas also serve a sensitive transitional function from one
land use to another that must be protected from incompatible development or
redevelopment. The preservation and appropriate development of these areas
require rules and regulations specifically addressing these distinctive
characteristics. The Design Review District has been created and shall be
mapped on the Zoning Map in furtherance of the following public purposes, which
are hereby found to be in the interest of the health, prosperity, and welfare
of the Village and its residents:
   A.   Special character. To effect and accomplish the protection,
enhancement, perpetuation, and use of improvements and areas of special
character or special historic and aesthetic interest or value which represent
or reflect elements of the Village's cultural, social, economic, political, and
architectural history or distinction.
   B.   Local atmosphere. To maintain the local, "small town" atmosphere of
various residential and business areas within the Village.
   C.   Compatibility. To insure compatibility of new development with the
existing characteristics of the area.
   D.   Transitional areas. To protect sensitive areas of transition from one
land use to another.
   E.   Attractiveness. To protect and enhance the Village's attractiveness to
visitors and the support and stimulus to local business provided thereby.
   F.   Strong economy. To strengthen the economy of the Village.
   G.   Education, pleasure, and welfare. To promote the use of areas within
the Design Review District for the education, pleasure, and welfare of the
residents of the Village.
Sec. 8-102: Overlay district:
The Design Review District appears on the Zoning Map as an "Overlay District,"
imposed on top of other districts created by this Code and referred to in this
Section as "base districts." Development of properties in the Design Review
District must comply both with the regulations of the Design Review District
and with the regulations of the base district in which they are located. When
there is any conflict between the Design Review District and the base district,
the more restrictive provision shall control.
Sec. 8-103: Mapping restrictions:
The Design Review District shall be mapped on the Zoning Map only in those
areas of the Village that constitute logically distinct areas having the
potential to provide cultural and civic benefits for the residents of the
Village by reason of the prevalence of at least two of the following factors:
   A.   Historical interest. The presence of special historical interest
relating to local, state, or national history.
   B.   Special character. The presence of special character or aesthetic
interest or value caused by the development pattern of the area or by natural
conditions or vegetative, landscaping, or topographical features of the area.
   C.   Historic architectural style. The presence of one or more periods or
styles of architecture typical of one or more eras in the history of the
Village that gives the area a distinct character.
   D.   Local architectural value. The concentration of indigenous examples of
local architecture that have not been significantly altered from their original
design.
   E.   Distinguished buildings or structures. The presence of one or more
distinguished buildings or structures of high architectural quality and
historic interest.
   F.   Transitional areas. A location in a sensitive transitional area between
varied land uses requiring careful control of development, redevelopment, and
remodeling, tailored to the special character of the area, to preserve and
enhance the transitional function served by existing structures and uses.
The Design Review District shall be mapped on the Zoning Map only pursuant to
Subsection
11-601D of this Code.
Sec. 8-104: Development plan required:
Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 11-601D1 of this Code, the Design
Review District shall be mapped only after preparation by the Board of Trustees
of a written and graphic plan for the area proposed to be included in the
district addressing the above-listed factors and describing the purposes and
intentions of the Board of Trustees in mapping the district. Such a written and
graphic plan shall be attached to, incorporated into, and approved as part of
any ordinance granting approval of an application to map a Design Review
District.
The requirement of this Section shall not apply to the area previously
classified as the "Historic Graue Mill Gateway District" by Ordinance No. 10-7-
80, which area is being mapped into the Design Review District as of the
effective date of this Code.
Sec. 8-105: Design review permit required:
Unless a Design Review permit shall have first been obtained pursuant to
Section 11-605 of this Code, no person shall perform, cause, or permit any
construction, alteration, remodeling, removal, movement, or demolition of any
building, structure, or other improvement or premises that is located within
the Design Review District, and no person shall secure or issue a permit
authorizing any such work. No person shall maintain any property located within
the Design Review District on which any such work has been performed in the
absence of, or in violation of the terms of, a Design Review permit. Repair of
fire, storm, or other catastrophic damage with the same material and
configuration as existed prior to the fire does not require a Design Review
permit.
PART II. HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT (HOD)
Sec. 8-201: Purpose and Applicability:
   A.   Purpose. The Historic Overlay District is intended to promote local
historic preservation efforts and to help preserve structures with historic,
architectural, or cultural significance in the Village of Hinsdale by creating
a district within which the Village may provide certain incentives that
encourage the preservation, rehabilitation, enhancement, and restoration of
structures deemed to be historically significant within the District.
   B.   Applicability. The Historic Overlay District appears on the Zoning Map
as an "Overlay District," imposed on top of other zoning districts created by
this Code and referred to in this Section as "Base Zoning Districts." The
regulations of the Historic Overlay District shall supplement those of the Base
Zoning Districts, and development of properties with historically significant
structures in the Historic Overlay District shall comply with the regulations
of the Base District, the requirements of the Design Review Overlay District
created by Part I of Article VIII, where applicable, and, where an Applicant,
as defined herein, chooses to do so in conformance with the requirements of
this Part II, the Historic Overlay District. In the case of any conflict or
overlap, the regulations and standards applicable to the Historic Overlay
District set forth in this Part II shall take precedence. (Ord. O2022-27, § 3,
9-20-2022)
Sec. 8-202: Historic Overlay District Boundaries:
   A.   Establishment of District Boundaries. The Historic Overlay District
shall be comprised of all or parts of the various zoning districts within the
Village and its boundaries shall be established pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section 11-601 (Amendments) of this Zoning Code. The areas zoned
Historic Overlay District need not be contiguous.
   B.   Amendment of District Boundaries. Once established, the boundaries of
the Historic Overlay District may be further amended pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section
11-601  (Amendments) of this Zoning Code. (Ord. O2022-27, § 3, 9-20-2022)
Sec. 8-203: Historically Significant Structures Property List, Preservation
Incentives and Operation of the Historic Overlay District:
   This Part II operates in conjunction with Chapter 14-7 of Title 14 (Historic
Preservation) of the Village Code. Following the creation of the Historic
Overlay District, a Historically Significant Structures Property List within
the District shall be created by the following the procedures set forth in
Section 14-7-3 of the Village Code. Properties on the Historically Significant
Structures Property List and located within the Historic Overlay District are
eligible to seek certain Preservation Incentives, as also set forth in Chapter
14-7 of Title 14 (Historic Preservation) of the Village Code. (Ord. O2022-27, §
3, 9-20-2022)
Sec. 8-204: Definitions:
   For the purposes of this Article, the definitions set forth in Chapter 14-
7 of Title 14 (Historic Preservation) of the Village Code shall apply. (Ord.
O2022-27, § 3, 9-20-2022)
Sec. 8-205: Land Use and Development Regulations:
   A.   Land Uses. The use regulations of the underlying Base Zoning District
shall apply in the Historic Overlay District.
   B.   Bulk Regulations. Except in the case of properties listed on the
Historically Significant Structures Property List set forth in Appendix 1 to
Chapter 14-7 (Historic Overlay Zoning District) of the Village Code, the
applicable bulk regulations of the underlying Base Zoning District, including
any footnotes, shall apply. In cases where an Applicant seeks a Preservation
Incentive pursuant to Chapter 14-7 of the Village Code that includes use of the
alternative bulk regulations set forth in Table 8-1 below, the below bulk
regulations shall apply upon application, compliance with any program
requirements, approval of a Preservation Incentive Certificate by the Historic

prior approval of the village manager on the basis of the adequacy of the
parcel size, parking provisions, and traffic access and the absence of undue
adverse impact on other properties. Such use shall be limited to a period not
to exceed ten (10) days. Such use need not comply with the yard requirements of
this code except that structures or equipment that might block the view of

      9.   Others: In any district, any other temporary use consistent with the
purposes of this code and with the purposes and intent of the regulations of
the district in which such use is located; provided, however, that any such use
shall require the specific prior approval of the board of trustees. The board
of trustees shall establish a limitation on the duration of every temporary use
approved pursuant to this subsection D9. Any approval granted hereunder shall
be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was given, and

   F.   Use Limitations:
      1.   General Limitations: Every temporary use shall comply with the
limitations made applicable to specified temporary uses by subsection D of this

significant negative impact, including aesthetic impact, on any adjacent
property or on the area, as a whole, in which it is located.
      2.   Hours And Days Of Operation: No temporary use shall be operated
during any hours or on any days of the week except such as are designated by
the village manager in the certificate required by subsection C of this
section, on the basis of the nature of the temporary use and the character of

      4.   Traffic: No temporary use shall be permitted if additional vehicular
traffic reasonably expected to be generated by such temporary use would have
undue detrimental effects on surrounding streets and uses.
      5.   Conflicts With Other Temporary Uses: No temporary use shall be
permitted if such use would conflict with another previously authorized
temporary use.

      7.   Parking: Before approving any temporary use, the village manager
shall make an assessment of the total number of off street parking spaces that
will be reasonably required in connection with the proposed temporary use, on
the basis of the particular use, its intensity, and the availability of other
parking facilities in the area, and shall approve such temporary use only if
such off street parking is provided. No temporary use shall be authorized that
would, in the opinion of the manager, unreasonably reduce the amount of off
street parking spaces available for use in connection with permanent uses
located on the zoning lot in question.
      8.   Additional Conditions: Every temporary use shall, in addition,
comply with, and the village manager may impose, such other conditions as may

public health, safety, and welfare. (1991 Code)
Sec. 9-104: Off Street Parking:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the requirements set out in this section is to
further the appropriate provision and design of off street parking and loading
areas that will:
      1.   Provide access for occupants, employees, customers, clients and
visitors to land uses in a community dependent on automobile and truck
transportation;
      2.   Foster safe and efficient circulation of vehicles and pedestrians
both on private property and on adjacent public streets; and
      3.   Minimize nuisance in residential areas from on or off street parking
of large numbers of, or incompatible types of, vehicles.
   B.   Authorization: Subject to the limitations of this section and
subsections 9-101D3 and D4 of this article, off street parking is permitted as
an accessory use in all districts. Off street parking as a principal use is
permitted only when expressly authorized by the regulations applicable to the
district in question. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
right of any person to provide off street parking in excess of the requirements
herein established but all such parking shall comply with the standards of this
section.
   C.   Applicability To Existing, New, And Expanded Uses:
      1.   General Applicability: Except as provided otherwise in this section,
the provisions of this section shall apply to, and off street parking spaces
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this section shall be provided for,
all existing and new uses, in accordance with the provisions of articles X and
XII of this code.
      2.   Changes In Existing Use: Whenever a use existing on the effective
date of this section is changed to a new use, parking spaces shall be provided
as required by this code for the new use. Notwithstanding this requirement,
however, when the existing use was deficient in required parking spaces on the
effective date of this section, then the new use may be established with a
parking space deficiency as follows:
         (a)   If the new use requires the same number, or more, parking spaces
than the existing use, and more spaces than exist for the existing use, then
the new use may be established with a deficiency equal in number to the
preexisting deficiency; or
         (b)   If the new use requires fewer parking spaces than the existing
use, but more spaces than exist for the existing use, then the new use may be
established with a deficiency equal in number to the number of spaces required
for that new use minus the number of existing spaces; or
         (c)   If the new use requires the same number of, or fewer, parking
spaces than exist for the existing use, then no deficiency shall be permitted
for the new use.
      3.   Increase In Use Intensity: Whenever the intensity of use of any
structure or use is increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor
area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for
required parking spaces, parking spaces as required herein shall be provided
for such increase in intensity of use; provided, however, that this shall not
apply to the addition of dwelling units in any structure in the B-2 central
business district.
   D.   Exceptions:
      1.   Minor Additions: Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
section, no building or use lawfully existing on the effective date of this
code, or any amendment to it establishing parking requirements with respect to
such structure or use, shall be required to provide any additional parking
spaces pursuant to this section unless and until the aggregate increase in the
units of measurement by which the parking requirement is calculated shall equal
ten percent (10%) or more of the units of measurement required upon such
effective date, in which event parking spaces as required herein shall be
provided for the total aggregate increase.
      2.   Nonconforming Locations And Designs: Nothing in this section shall
be construed to prohibit the continued utilization of any parking space as an
accessory use to any structure or use for parking of a vehicle that may
lawfully be parked in such space solely because such space does not satisfy the
location or design requirements of this code, or any amendment to it, if such
space was validly in use as an accessory use to such structure or use on the
effective date of this code or such amendment.
      3.   Remote Parking Spaces: When proposed to eliminate a parking
deficiency or when required because of a change in use or an increase in use
intensity pursuant to subsection C2 or C3 of this section, parking spaces may
be located within any district adjacent to the district in which the principal
use in question is a permitted use, or within the same zoning district as, and
within one thousand feet (1,000') of, the zoning lot on which the use to be
served is located; provided, however, that such remote parking spaces may be
allowed only when such remote site is covenanted to remain as parking for so
long as said parking spaces are required to meet the standards of this code.
      4.   Access Across Separate Zoning Lot: No such access to an adjacent
street shall be provided through a zoning lot other than the zoning lot on
which the parking lot is located except across a permanent, recorded access
easement in form and substance satisfactory to the village attorney.
      5.   Parking Space Deficiencies In B-2 District: When an owner or
applicant is required to provide additional off street parking spaces pursuant
to this section for an existing, new, or change of use in the B-2 central
business district, that owner or applicant may pay to the village a per space
fee of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in lieu of providing up to
seven (7) of those required additional spaces. In addition, that owner or
applicant may pay the same per space fee in lieu of providing a greater number
of those required additional spaces if, but only if, that owner or applicant
establishes to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that all of the
following standards are satisfied:
         (a)   Effect On Purpose: The elimination of more than seven (7) of
those additional required spaces will not have an unduly adverse effect on the
purposes for which this code was enacted, or on the purposes for which the
regulations of B-2 central business district were established, or on general
purpose and intent of the official comprehensive plan; and
         (b)   Effect On Adjacent Property: The elimination of more than seven
(7) of those additional required spaces will not have an unduly adverse effect
on adjacent property or the public health, safety, and general welfare; and
         (c)   Effect On Traffic Congestion: The elimination of more than seven
(7) of those additional required spaces will not cause undue traffic
congestion; and
         (d)   Compliance: The proposed use or development for which those
additional spaces are required complies with all standards imposed on it by the
particular provision of this code authorizing that use or development.
The fees paid to the village pursuant to this subsection D5 shall be used by
the village for improvements benefiting the B-2 central business district,
including the possible development and maintenance of additional parking
facilities in the B-2 district or on property abutting the B-2 district.
         (e) Parking Space Reductions In The B-2 District: If any owner or
applicant to which the requirements of this subsection apply is authorized to
reduce the number of off street parking spaces existing on the effective date
of this code accessory to a use in the B-2 central business district pursuant
to planned development approval, grant of a variation, or some other approval
made by the village, then that owner or applicant shall pay to the village the
sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per space for each space reduced,
which payment shall be in addition to any payment made pursuant to subsection
D5 of this section. Such sums so paid to the village shall be used by the
village for improvements benefiting the B-2 central business district,
including the possible development and maintenance of additional parking
facilities in said district or on property abutting said district.
   E.   Landbanking/Reserve Areas For Required Parking:
      1.   Landbanking Authorized: Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, the board of trustees may, by special use permit granted pursuant to
section
11-602 of this code, reduce the total number of off street parking spaces
required to be paved pursuant to subsection J of this section or the stall
length and width dimension required pursuant to subsection I4 of this section,
subject to acceptance by the property owner of the conditions set forth in
subsections E2 through E4 of this section.
      2.   Termination Of Landbanking: The board of trustees shall have the
right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to require the property owner or
his or her successor at any time to increase the stall length and width to the
dimension required by subsection I4 of this section or to increase the number
of parking spaces provided to serve said development up to the maximum required
by subsection J of this section for the property in question as if no special
use permit for landbanking had been granted.
      3.   Alternate Plans Required: Every application for a special use permit
to allow landbanking of required parking spaces shall be accompanied by
alternate detailed parking plans. One plan shall show the full stall length and
width required by subsection I4 of this section and the full number of parking
spaces required pursuant to subsection J of this section; the other plan shall
show the reduced stall length and width or the reduced number of parking spaces
or both, as the case may be, proposed to be provided pursuant to the special
use permit being sought and also shall show the landscaping treatment of areas
proposed to be reserved for future parking requirements. Both such plans shall
show the location on the site of all parking areas, the exact number of parking
spaces to be provided, and complete details for: a) wheel stops, b) markings,
c) curbing, d) surfacing, e) screening and landscaping, f) lighting, g)
signing, and h) access. The design plans for such parking areas shall be
subject to the approval of the board of trustees.
      4.   Open Space Covenant: As a condition of granting such special use
permit, the applicant shall file with the village manager his unconditional
agreement and covenant in form and substance satisfactory to the village
attorney that areas reserved for future parking shall be maintained as
landscaped open space until and unless required to be used for off street
parking pursuant to subsection E2 of this section or until such covenant is
released by the board of trustees. The ordinance granting such permit, together
with such agreement and covenant, shall be recorded with the applicable county
recorder of deeds.

               (A)   Driveway Approach: When a driveway approach to a
residential lot intersects with an alley or other right-of-way that: 1) has
only one lane and 2) is constructed to connect only to one other right-of-way
thus providing only one direction for ingress and egress, then that driveway
approach and driveway shall be constructed to provide enough maneuvering room,
in the determination of the Village's Director of Public Services, to permit
the direction of a vehicle to be reversed so that the vehicle may both enter
into and exit from the residential lot in such a manner that the vehicle may be
driven forward along the one lane right-of-way. The intent of this provision is
to prohibit the creation of any need for any vehicle to be driven in reverse
down a one lane, one outlet alley or other right-of-way for any distance away
from a residential lot.
               (B)   Garage In Similar Circumstances: If a garage is
constructed on a residential lot under the circumstances stated in subsection
F3(e)(v)(A) of this section, then the wall of the garage farthest from the

      2.   Unspecified Uses: When the ultimate use of a structure is not known,
the maximum number of spaces that might be required for any use to which the
structure might reasonably be devoted shall be provided.
      3.   Computation Of Required Spaces:
         (a)   Fractional Spaces: When determination of the number of required
parking spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction
shall require one additional parking space.
         (b)   Capacity Calculations: When parking spaces are required on the
basis of capacity, capacity shall be determined based on the occupancy
standards established by the Hinsdale Building Code.
         (c)   Bench Seating: In stadia, auditoria, houses of worship, and
other places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews,
or other similar seating facilities, each twenty two inches (22") of such
seating facility shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining
the requirement for off street parking facilities under this Code.
         (d)   Population Calculations: When parking spaces are required on the
basis of the number of customers, students, or similar measure, the maximum
number for which the structure is designed shall govern, except that when the
structure has no design capacity the maximum number present at any one time
shall govern. When parking spaces are required on the basis of the number of
employees, the number of employees working during the largest work shift shall
govern. (Ord. 94-4, §2, 2-1-1994; Ord. 95-5, §2, 3-7-1995; Ord. 2000-10, §6, 5-

Sec. 9-106: Signs:
   A.   Purpose: The regulation of signs by this code is intended to promote
and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing the depreciation
of property values caused by signs that are incompatible with surrounding land
uses; by creating a more attractive economic and business climate within the
office and commercial areas of the village; by enhancing and protecting the
physical appearance of all areas of the village; by protecting signs from
obstruction by other signs; and by reducing the distractions, obstructions, and
hazards to pedestrian and auto traffic caused by the indiscriminate placement
and use of signs.
   B.   Scope: The regulations of this section shall govern and control the
erection, enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation, maintenance,
relocation, and removal of all signs within the village visible from any

         (b)   Level Of Illumination: In no event shall the illumination of any
sign, resulting from any internal or external artificial light source, exceed
fifty (50) foot-candles when measured with a standard light meter held
perpendicular to the sign face at a distance equal to the narrowest dimension
of such sign face. All artificial illumination shall be so designed, located,
shielded, and directed as to illuminate only the sign face or faces and to
prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon adjacent property or streets.
In no event shall signs located in single-family residential districts be
illuminated.
         (c)   Signs Adjacent To Residential Areas: Any illuminated sign
located on a lot abutting or across a street from, and visible from, any
residentially zoned area shall not be illuminated between the hours of ten
o'clock (10:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. except that such sign may
remain illuminated during such time as the activity to which the sign pertains
is open for business so long as such sign is not a public or private nuisance.

expressly permitted by this section, no flashing, blinking, or intermittent
lights shall be permitted.
         (e)   Gas Tube Signs Prohibited: Exposed neon and other gas tube signs

purposes of this subsection E2, black and white shall be considered to be
colors except when either is used only as the background of a sign.
      3.   Minimum Elevation Of Certain Signs: The bottom of every projecting
sign or wall sign and every awning or canopy valance bearing a nameplate sign
shall be elevated at least eight feet (8') above grade. Whenever possible, wall
signs on the same facade shall maintain the same top and bottom elevations
above grade.

applicable provision of the Hinsdale building code.
      6.   Traffic Safety:
         (a)   Confusion With Traffic Signals: No sign shall be maintained at
any location where by reason of its position, size, shape, content, color, or
illumination it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or
be confused with any traffic control sign, signal, or device or where it may
interfere with, mislead, or confuse traffic.
         (b)   Obstruction Of Sight Triangles Prohibited: No sign, nor any part
of a sign other than a supporting pole or brace no greater than eighteen inches
(18") in width or diameter, shall be located lower than eight feet (8') from
grade within the area of any sight triangle as defined in title 7, chapter 1,
article D of the village code.
      7.   Signs In Rights Of Way: Except as provided in this subsection E7, no
sign, except governmental signs and decorative post signs authorized by this
section, shall be placed in or extend into or over any public property or
public right of way, except those signs of structural types set forth in

international building code, as adopted by the village pursuant to section
9-2-1 of the village code of Hinsdale, as amended, and said signs shall be
subject to the projection and other standards for such signs, with the
exception of clearance standards. Civic event signs may extend on, into, or
over a public right of way upon the specific prior approval of the board of
trustees on the basis of need, impact on pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and
impact on surrounding property. Decorative post signs shall: a) be allowed only

all applicable laws, in a safe and secure condition, and in a neat and orderly
condition and good working order at all times, and to prevent the development
of any rust, corrosion, rotting, or other deterioration in the physical
appearance or safety of such sign. The premises around ground and pylon signs
shall be kept clean and free of all rubbish and weeds.
      10.   Sign Measurement:
         (a)   Area To Be Included: The supporting structure or bracing of a
sign shall be omitted in measuring the area of the sign unless such structure
or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign. When a sign has
more than one display face, all faces shall be included in determining the area
of the sign. The area of the supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall be
consistent with the sign it supports and location in which it is placed.
         (b)   Area Of Signs With Backing: The area of all signs with backing
shall be measured by computing the area of the sign backing.
         (c)   Area Of Signs Without Backing: The area of all signs without
backing shall be measured by computing the area of the smallest single regular
geometric figure that can encompass all words, letters, figures, emblems, and
other elements of the sign message.
         (d)   Area Of Signs With And Without Backing: The area of all signs
formed by a combination of elements with and without backing shall be measured
by combining the area of such elements measured in accordance with the
foregoing subsections.

any other provision of this Section, no landscaping, fencing, or other
screening shall be erected or maintained at a height in excess of three feet
(3') within the area of any sight triangle as defined in Title 7, Chapter 1,
Article D of the Village Code.
      8.   Existing Vegetation: Whenever determined as practical by the
Community Development Director and Village Forester, existing trees and
vegetation on a lot may be preserved and counted toward any required on-site
plant materials.
      9.   Public Landscaping: Any proposed tree or landscaping installation or
removal in a dedicated right-of-way shall be in conformance with the provisions
of Title 7, Chapter 2 of the Village Code. Tree planting locations shall be
adjusted to avoid conflicts with existing street trees.
      10.   Selection, Installation, Planting, And Maintenance:
         (a)   All plant materials shall comply with the most recent edition of
provisions set forth by the American Standard for Nursery Stock, ANSI Z60.1.
         (b)   Plant materials used in conformance with the requirements in
this Section shall be selected to provide:

color and variety in texture and shape.
         (f)   Plant materials shall be maintained in a neat and orderly
appearance.
         (g)   All lots shall be mowed and kept free of accumulations of refuse
and debris, and other unsightly or nuisance-creating materials by the owner or
agent of the premises.
         (h)   All landscape materials must be maintained in good condition,
present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, and kept free of refuse and
debris. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced within six (6)
months of notification by the Village or the next reasonable available growing/
planting season. All fences, steps, retaining walls and similar elements
required within the landscape plan must be maintained in good repair. The owner
of the premises shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, and
replacement of all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls, refuse
areas, and similar site elements. Irrigation systems, when provided, must be
maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of the plant
material and the conservation of water over the entire life of the development.
      11.   Calculations: Any plant quantity calculations shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole number.
      12.   Stormwater Management Infrastructure: Landscape improvements should
be designed to facilitate stormwater runoff infiltration through curb design,
soil depth, plant selection, and site grading to convey stormwater to the
landscaped areas. Where practical, landscaped areas or buffers shall function
as bioretention and infiltration areas to assist in water quality protection
and facilitate groundwater recharge. Green infrastructure is considered a
permitted encroachment in any required yard, subject to Village approval.
   D.   Enforcement of Landscaping Provisions:
      1.   No building permit or certificate of occupancy will be issued for
any lot or use subject to the requirements of this Section unless all the
requirements of this Section have been fulfilled. Failure to implement the
landscape plan, or to maintain the lot or use in substantial conformance with
the landscape plan, is cause for revocation of the certificate of occupancy
and/or the application of fines and penalties, as established in this Section.
In addition, all landscaping is subject to periodic inspection.
      2.   Timing for Installation: If weather prohibits the installation of
landscaping at the time an occupancy permit is applied for, or other
circumstances exists beyond the applicant's control that delays installation, a
temporary occupancy permit may be issued, subject to the following:
         (a)   The applicant must provide, in writing, the reasons why the
required landscaping cannot be completed prior to the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy and the date all landscaping will be completed.
         (b)   The applicant must install protective ground cover within sixty
(60) days once the temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. The Community
Development Director can grant an extension if inclement weather or other
circumstances exist. Temporary occupancy permits issued over the winter months
shall require that protective ground cover is installed by June 15.
         (c)   The landscape installer shall provide an itemized cost estimate
for all the landscaping to be completed.
         (d)   Prior to the issuance of a temporary occupancy permit, the
applicant shall provide assurance via a signed affidavit that the required
landscaping will be completed.
         (e)   The applicant shall deposit with the Village a cash escrow,
performance bond, or a letter of credit in the amount of 150% of the cost
estimate of the approved Landscape Plan. If the developer/owner does not
complete the landscaping by the stated date the landscaping was to be
completed, the Village may use the cash escrow or call the surety bond or
letter of credit to contract with a landscaping company to complete the
landscaping to meet Village Standards or take legal action against the
applicant.
         (f)   All landscape material shall be guaranteed for a period of one
(1) year after initial planting.
      3.   Changes to Approved Landscape Plans: Once approved, minor changes to
screening or a landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net
amount of plant material, the general type of plant material, or other minor
changes may be approved by the Community Development Director. Major changes
shall be approved as a Major Adjustment to a Site Plan Review pursuant to
Section
11-604  of this Code, or a Major Adjustment to a Planned Development pursuant
to Section
11-603 .
      4.   Alternative Compliance: To allow for flexibility in addressing
unique, site-specific redevelopment challenges, the Village Board may waive
certain landscaping or screening requirements and approve an alternative
compliance plan when it is determined that one or more of the following
conditions are present:
         (a)   The site or an existing building has space limitations or an
unusual shape that makes strict compliance impossible or impractical;
         (b)   Conditions on or adjacent to the site such as topography, soils,
vegetation or existing structures or utilities are such that strict compliance
is impossible, impractical or of no value in terms of advancing the general
purposes of this Section;
         (c)   Safety considerations such as intersection visibility, utility
locations, etc., make alternative compliance necessary;
         (d)   Creative, alternative plans will provide an equal or better
means of meeting the intent of the landscaping and screening regulations of
this Section;
         (e)   The property is in the B-2 District and strict compliance would
be inconsistent with the historic and downtown character of the area; or
         (f)   The property is owned by the Village of Hinsdale.
      If alternative compliance is requested, the applicant shall be required
to show that landscaping or screening cannot be accommodated on the site or
requirements must be modified for specific purposes due to practical
difficulties, safety concerns, or for aesthetic reasons, or where imposition of
the requirements would be inconsistent with the intent and purposes of this
Section. If only certain requirements can be accommodated on the site, those
elements are required, unless otherwise approved. The Community Development
Director or Board of Trustees, where applicable, shall make the determination
that all or a portion of the required landscape does not have to be installed.
   E.   Components of a Landscape Plan:
      1.   Review and approval of a landscape plan is required as part of a
Planned Development, Site Plan Review, or Design Review for any development
proposal prior to issuance of a building permit, unless otherwise determined

provide the maximum reasonably achievable screening, as determined by the
village manager, of such antenna and antenna support structure from view from
adjacent properties and public or private streets. See Subsections 9-101D7 and
D8 of this article for additional requirements applicable to antennas and
antenna support structures.
      2.   Personal Wireless Services Antennas: Ground mounted personal
wireless services antennas and antenna support structures and related
electronic equipment and equipment structures shall be buffered and screened by
a perimeter landscaped open space of not less than ten feet (10') in width,
consisting of a densely planted evergreen hedge of not less than six feet (6')
in height and other landscaping materials. Such screening shall be provided
between any such ground mounted personal wireless services antenna or antenna
support structure and each lot line of the property on which such personal
wireless services antenna or antenna support structure is located so as to
provide the maximum reasonably achievable screening, as determined by the board
of trustees, of such personal wireless services antenna and antenna support
structure from view from adjacent properties and public or private streets.
Such screening requirements may be waived by the board of trustees where the
operator of such personal wireless services antenna demonstrates that such
screening will substantially interfere with the provision of personal wireless
services, in which case the operator shall provide the maximum reasonably
achievable screening as is approved by the board of trustees. See applicable
district regulations for additional requirements applicable to personal
wireless services antennas and antenna support structures.
   M.   Mechanical Equipment:
      1.   Applicability: Except for antennas mounted on roofs pursuant to the
provisions of this code, mechanical equipment includes but is not limited to
heating, air conditioning, ventilation, generators, and other similar
equipment. This Subsection does not apply to detached or attached single-family
residential buildings. This Subsection applies to all new buildings, and to the
installation of new equipment, or to the replacement or relocation of existing
mechanical equipment for existing buildings.
      2.   Screening for Roof-Mounted Mechanical Equipment: All roof-mounted
mechanical equipment shall be fully screened from view from the adjacent public
or private streets by installing a parapet wall or other screening structure.
Such screening structure shall be constructed of the same materials as, or
materials architecturally and aesthetically compatible with, the principal
building facade to the height of such equipment.
      3.   Screening for Ground-Mounted Mechanical Equipment: All ground-
mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened on all sides with a wall, fence,
or dense landscaping equal in height or greater to the height of such
equipment. Such screening shall be aesthetically compatible with the principal
building façade.
   N.   Fences: Fences erected as permitted obstructions in any required yard
shall comply with the requirements of Section 9-12-3  of the Village Code.
(Ord. 97-4, § 8, 3-4-1997; Ord. 99-6, § 7E, 3-2-1999; Ord. O2006-44, § 4, 6-20-
2006; Ord. O2025-05, § 3, - -2025)
Sec. 9-108:   Short-Term Rentals and Other Rentals:
   A.   The Village Board of Trustees finds and determines that short-term
rentals as defined in Section
12-206 of this Code present issues within the Village which differ from those
presented by longer-term rentals. Parking, noise, excessive activity, the
presence of unlicensed animals, and other nuisance activities, along with
concerns for the health and safety of renters, the conduct of prohibited
commercial activity within residential areas, and the protection of the
peaceful and quiet nature of the Village's residential neighborhoods, are of
concern to both residents and the Village's elected officials and necessitate
the prohibition of short-term rentals in residential zoning districts within
the Village.
   B.   Except as otherwise provided herein, short-term rentals, as defined in
Section
12-206 of this Code, are specifically prohibited within the residential zoning
districts of the Village.
   C.   The term of any lease or occupancy agreement which has satisfied the
minimum term required by the definition of short-term rental in Section
12-206 may be extended on a month to month basis on the condition that the
tenant(s) remain(s) the same.
   D.   No owner shall lease or allow occupancy of a dwelling unit by a tenant
more than four (4) times during any twelve (12) month period.
   E.   The restrictions of this Section shall be applicable whether the rental
premises comprise(s) all or a part of the principal dwelling unit, or all or
part of any legal, non-conforming dwelling unit in an accessory structure. The
residential lease of all or any part of an accessory structure other than one
containing a legal, non-conforming dwelling unit is prohibited, regardless of
its term.
   F.   The property owner shall remain responsible for compliance with all
applicable provisions of this Code and/or the Village Code during the term of
any allowable rental and/or occupancy agreement and/or during the term of any
occupancy of the rental premises by persons other than the property owner.
   G.   No temporary structure shall be permitted to be used for a residential
rental, regardless of its term.
   H.   The prohibition on short term rentals as herein provided shall not
apply when the immediately preceding owner of a property maintains possession
of the dwelling unit after closing on a real estate transaction for the sale
thereof and leases said property back from the successor owner for a period of
time pursuant to a written agreement, or in other circumstances where a Village
Code Enforcement Officer, upon investigation and in their discretion,
determines that the circumstances of the rental do not constitute the
repetitive commercial type of rental activity that this Section is intended to
prohibit.
   I.   Each day a principal dwelling or any accessory structure within a
residential zoning district in the Village is offered for rent as a short-term
rental, is leased or rented as a short-term rental, and/or each day a principal
dwelling or any accessory structure is occupied as a "short-term rental", as
that term is defined herein, shall constitute a separate violation of this
Section.
   J.   In addition, operation of any short-term rental or other rental within
the Village in violation of the provisions of this Section shall be deemed a
public nuisance and abated pursuant to all available remedies, including but
not limited to injunctive relief.
(Ord. O2024-25, § 5, 8-13-2024)
ARTICLE X. NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
10-101: General Provisions
10-102: Nonconforming Uses Of Land And Nonconforming Uses In Structures
Designed For A Permitted Use
10-103: Nonconforming Uses In Structures Not Designed For A Permitted Use
10-104: Precode Structures
10-105: Legal Nonconforming Lots Of Record
10-106: Nonconforming Signs
Sec. 10-101: General provisions:
   A.   Purposes. This Article X regulates and limits the continued existence
of uses, structures, lots, and signs established prior to the effective date of
this Code that do not conform to the regulations of this Code applicable in the
zoning districts in which such uses, structures, lots, and signs are located.
The zoning districts established by this Code are designed to guide the future
use of land within the Village by encouraging the development or maintenance of
desirable residential, business, and office areas with appropriate groupings of
compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is
frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are
established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is
generally desirable.
   B.   General scope and scheme of regulation. Separate restrictions are
established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of structures
designed for a permitted use, nonconforming uses of structures not designed for
a permitted use, nonconforming structures (herein sometimes referred to as
"pre-code structures"), nonconforming lots of record, and nonconforming signs.
The degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity is
generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the
amount of investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type.
Pursuant to Section
11-503 of this Code, provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions
of this Article X when practical difficulties exist.
   C.   Exception for repairs pursuant to public order. Nothing in this Article
X shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe
condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who
is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to
be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition, provided such
restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this
Article X prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or
destroyed structures or signs.
   D.   Nonconforming accessory uses and structures. No use, structure, or sign
that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue
after such principle use or structure shall have been terminated, unless it
shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which
it is located.
Sec. 10-102: Nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses in structures
designed for a permitted use:
   A.   Authority to continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this
Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use not involving the use of a
structure, or involving only a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming
use of land, or located in a structure designed for a use permitted in the
district in which it is located may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Subsections B through
H of this Section and in Subsections D and E of Section 10-101 of this Code.
   For purposes of this Section, any structure that is used in connection with
a nonconforming use of land and that has an assessed value of less than
$5,000.00 on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto creating
such nonconformity shall be considered to be a structure accessory to a
nonconforming use of land.
   B.   Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and the installation or relocation of non-bearing or
curtain walls, non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be
performed on any structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or
that is designed for a permitted use but devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use; provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be deemed
to authorize any violation of Subsections C through I of this Section.
   C.   Structural alteration. No structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless
the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new parking,
loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any
existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such
structure. In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been
created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this
Code shall control.
   D.   Enlargement of structure. No structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any
manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the use of such
structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in
which it is located. No such enlargement shall create any new parking, loading,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing
parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. In
determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been created or
increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this Code shall
control.
   E.   Extension of use. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is
accessory to a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use in a structure
designed for a permitted use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being
limited to:
      1.   An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, to any
structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on
the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto that causes such use to
become nonconforming; and
      2.   An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a
building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not
occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code or any
amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming; and
      3.   An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal
hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto
that causes such use to become nonconforming.
   F.   Moving. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land
or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part, for any
distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless
such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located after being so moved.
   G.   Change in use. A nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or
involving only a structure that is accessory to the nonconforming use of land
or a nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in the
district in which it is located shall not be changed to any use other than a
use permitted in the zoning district in which the use or structure is located.
When such a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not
thereafter be changed back to any nonpermitted use. For purposes of this
Subsection G, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing
nonconforming use shall have been terminated and a permitted use shall have
commenced and continued for a period of five days. Any change of use in
violation of this Subsection shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the
lawfully existing nonconforming use.
   H.   Damage or destruction. Any structure:
      1.   That is accessory to a nonconforming use of land and that is damaged
or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 25 percent of the cost of
replacement of such structure new; or
      2.   That is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part
to a nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed by any means, where
such damage or destruction involves damage or destruction of the portion of
such structure devoted to the nonconforming use, to the extent of more than 25
percent of the cost of replacement of such portion new, shall not be restored
unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and unless such
restoration is accomplished without creating any new parking, loading, bulk,
yard, or space nonconformity or increasing the degree of any parking, loading,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or
destruction. In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been
created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this
Code shall control.
   When any such structure, or the portion thereof devoted to a nonconforming
use, is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the control of the owner
thereof to the extent of 25 percent or less of the cost of replacement new of
the structure, or the portion thereof devoted to a nonconforming use, repair or
restoration of such structure may be made; provided, however, that no repairs
or restorations shall be made that would create any new parking, loading, bulk,
yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any parking, loading,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or
destruction, nor shall any repairs or restoration except in conformity with the
applicable zoning district regulations be made unless a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after
the date of such partial damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to
completion.
   In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means
within the control of the owner be repaired or re-stored except in accordance
with Subsections B, C, and D of this Section.
   I.   Termination of certain uses.
      1.   Termination in accordance with previous amortization schedule. Any
nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only a
structure that is accessory to the nonconforming use of land that was required
to be removed by former Section 10-1-6 of the Hinsdale Zoning Ordinance, as
amended, that has not been removed in accordance with the terms of that section
shall be removed immediately and every such use is hereby declared to be
unlawful and a public nuisance.
      2.   Termination by abandonment. When a nonconforming use of land not
involving a structure or involving only a structure that is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land or when a nonconforming use of a part or all of a
structure that was designed for a use that is permitted in the zoning district
in which such structure is located is discontinued or abandoned for a period of
three consecutive months, regardless of any intent to resume or not to abandon
such use, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any
subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall comply with the use
regulations of the zoning district in which such land or structure is located.
   Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this Paragraph.
Sec. 10-103: Nonconforming uses in structures not designed for a permitted use:
   A.   Authority to continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this
Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use located in a structure not
designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which it is
located may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
regulations contained in Subsections B through H of this Section and in
Subsections D and E of Section 10-101 of this Code.
   B.   Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and the installation or relocation of non-bearing or
curtain walls, non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be
performed on any structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use
and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located; provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be
deemed to authorize any violation of Subsections C through I of this Section.
   C.   Structural alteration. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located shall be structurally altered
unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. No such alteration
shall create a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increase the degree of any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a parking or loading
nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-
104B1 and 9-105B1 of this Code shall control.
   D.   Enlargement of structure. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located shall be enlarged or added to in
any manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the entire
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all the regulations
of the district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new
parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of
any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such
structure. In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been
created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this
Code shall control.
   E.   Extension of use.
      1.   Prohibited extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not
designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which such
structure is located shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in
intensity by:
         (a)   An extension of such use to any structure or land area other
than that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code
or any amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming; or
         (b)   An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the
normal hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or any amendment
to it that causes such use to become nonconforming.
      2.   Permitted extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not
designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which such
structure is located may be extended throughout any part of such structure
lawfully existing on the effective date of this Code or any amendment to it
that causes such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that such
extension shall not be allowed unless off-street parking and loading spaces
required for such extension can be, and are, provided in accordance with the
requirements and restrictions of Sections 9-104 and 9-105 of this Code. No such
extension shall be deemed to affect the duty to terminate such use pursuant to
Subsection I of this Section.
   F.   Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use
and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
   G.   Change In Use: A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or
intended for a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located
shall not be changed to any use other than a nonconforming use of a more
restricted classification or a use permitted in the zoning district in which
the structure is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restricted nonconforming use or to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be
changed back to a less restricted nonconforming use. For purposes of this
subsection, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing
nonconforming use shall have been terminated and a more restricted
nonconforming use or a permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a
period of five (5) days. Any change of use in violation of this subsection
shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing nonconforming
use.
   H.   Damage Or Destruction: Any structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located that is damaged or destroyed, by
any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
replacement of such structure new shall not be restored unless such structure
and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located and unless such restoration is accomplished
without creating a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increasing the degree of any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity of such structure existing prior to such damage or destruction.
In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been created or
increased, the provisions of subsections 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this code shall
control.
   When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or less of
the cost of replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of such
structure may be made; provided, however, that no repairs or restorations shall
be made that would create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity or increase the degree of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or
space nonconformity of such structure existing prior to such damage or
destruction nor shall any repairs or restoration except in conformity with the
applicable zoning district regulations be made unless a certificate of zoning
compliance is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after
the date of such partial damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to
completion.
   In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means
within the control of the owner be repaired or restored except in accordance
with subsections B, C, and D of this section.
   I.   Termination Of Certain Uses:
      1.   Termination In Accordance With Previous Amortization Schedule: Any
antenna or antenna support structure that was required to be removed by former
section
10-1-6 of the Hinsdale zoning ordinance, as amended, and that remains
nonconforming with the provisions of subsections 9-101D6 and D7 of this code
that has not been removed in accordance with the terms of that section shall be
removed immediately and every such structure is hereby declared to be unlawful
and a public nuisance. Any structure subject to said section
10-1-6 that was not fully amortized pursuant thereto shall be terminated and
removed at the earliest date required either by that section or by this
subsection I.
      2.   Termination By Abandonment: When a nonconforming use of a part or
all of a structure that was not designed or intended for any use permitted in
the zoning district in which such structure is located is discontinued or
abandoned for a period of six (6) consecutive months, regardless of any intent
to resume or not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished or resumed.
   Any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the use
regulations of the district in which such structure is located.
   Any period of such discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this paragraph. (1991 Code)
Sec. 10-104: Precode Structures:
   A.   Authority To Continue: Any precode structure may be maintained,
altered, enlarged, rebuilt, restored, and repaired so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in subsections B through E of
this section and subsection
10-101D of this article.
   B.   Maintenance, Repair, Alteration, And Enlargement: Any precode structure
may be maintained, repaired, altered or enlarged; provided, however, that
except as hereinafter expressly provided, no such maintenance, repair,
alteration, or enlargement shall either create any new parking, loading, yard,
bulk or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any parking, loading,
yard, bulk, or space nonconformity of all or any part of such structure as it
existed on the effective date of this code. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence:
      1.   Front And Rear Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a precode
structure that is nonconforming with respect to a required front or rear yard
may be extended vertically within its existing perimeter walls but may not be
extended horizontally; and
      2.   Side Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure
that is nonconforming with respect to a required side yard may be extended
vertically within its existing perimeter walls; provided, however, that no such
extension shall be allowed within ten feet (10') of any side lot line in the R-
1 and R-2 districts or within six feet (6') of any side lot line in the R-3 and
R-4 districts; and
      3.   Side Yard Horizontal Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure
that is nonconforming with respect to a required side yard may be extended
horizontally between the required front and rear yard lines at a distance from
the side lot line equal to the greater of: a) the minimum existing distance
between said side lot line and said nonconforming portion or b) ten feet (10')
in the R-1 and R-2 districts or six feet (6') in the R-3 and R-4 districts; and
      4.   Roof Elevation Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that
is nonconforming with respect to the permitted maximum elevation may be
extended horizontally at an elevation in excess of said permitted maximum
elevation; provided, however, that the top of the roof of such extension shall
not exceed the top of the precode structure.
      5.   Roof Height Extensions: Any portion of precode structure located on
a conforming lot in a single-family residential district that is nonconforming
with respect to the permitted maximum height and that is a precode structure
solely due to the nonconforming height of the structure may be extended: a)
horizontally at a height in excess of said permitted maximum height but not in
excess of the roofline of the existing structure or b) horizontally and
vertically at a height in excess of the permitted maximum height but not in
excess of the height of the structure as of the date of initial occupancy of
the original structure, provided, however, that such extension shall not be
permitted where the height of the structure as of the date of initial occupancy
of the original structure exceeded the maximum height authorized by law; and,
in either case, such extension shall not extend more than twenty four inches
(24") beyond the exterior face of the exterior walls of said existing
structure.
      6.   Certain Garages Accessory To Certain Precode Detached Dwellings:
Notwithstanding the applicable maximum floor area and building coverage
regulations and notwithstanding the limitations set in subsection C1 of this
section, a detached garage accessory to, and on the same zoning lot as, a
precode single-family detached dwelling structure may be demolished and
replaced with a new detached garage if, but only if, all of the following
conditions and standards are met: a) the dwelling was constructed prior to
1950, b) the dwelling does not have an attached garage, and c) the replacement
garage does not exceed a total floor area of four hundred forty (440) square
feet.
For the purposes of this subsection B, any vertical or horizontal extension of
a precode structure in violation of subsection B5 of this section shall be
construed to increase the degree of an existing nonconformity. For purposes of
this subsection B, the provisions of subsection D of this section shall, where
applicable, be applied in determining the existence and extent of any side yard
nonconformity.
   C.   Damage Or Destruction: Any precode structure that is demolished,
damaged, or destroyed by any means, whether or not within the control of the
owner thereof, may be rebuilt, restored, or repaired; provided, however, that:
      1.   Voluntary Damage: In no event shall any demolition, damage, or
destruction to such a structure caused by any means within the control of the
owner be rebuilt, restored, or repaired except in conformity with all of the
applicable district regulations other than minimum lot area and lot dimension
regulations.
      2.   Involuntary Damage: In no event shall any damage or destruction to
such a structure caused by any means not within the control of the owner be
rebuilt, restored, or repaired so as to create any new parking, loading, yard,
bulk, or space nonconformity or to increase the degree of any parking, loading,
yard, bulk, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or
destruction. For the purposes of this subsection C2, any vertical or horizontal
extension of a structure in violation of the yard, bulk, or space regulations
applicable in the district in which such structure is located shall be
construed to increase the degree of an existing nonconformity, except that:
         (a)   Front And Rear Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a
precode structure that was, prior to such damage or destruction, nonconforming
with respect to a required front or rear yard may be extended vertically within

any lawfully existing nonconforming sign that is located on the premises of,
and accessory to, such business may be maintained, repaired, replaced, changed,
altered or structurally altered in a manner otherwise inconsistent with

past, present, and future trends of the village with respect to its population,
housing, economic, social, and environmental development patterns and its land,

lying within one and one-half (11/2) miles of its boundaries as they may from
time to time exist, prepared and recommended by the plan commission with the
advice and assistance of the village manager and the village manager's staff
and adopted by the board of trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together with
such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The term "official
comprehensive plan" also shall refer to any internally consistent and complete
portion of such a compilation relating to any one or more of the aforesaid

to be undertaken by the village with respect to its future maintenance and
development.
   D.   Effect: After the adoption of the official comprehensive plan or a part
thereof, no ordinance, regulation, or official map relating to the physical
maintenance, development, or redevelopment of the village or any land within it
shall be enacted, established, amended, or varied and no right of way, street,

Village Manager and the Village Manager's staff, shall exercise the powers and
duties delegated to it by Section 11-103 of this Article XI in the continuing

plan development is necessarily an informal one not readily adaptable to rigid

plan, shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the views, comments, and
criticisms of interested persons. In addition, the Plan Commission, prior to
making any recommendation for the adoption or amendment of a plan or part
thereof to the Board of Trustees, shall set, notice, and conduct a public
hearing thereon in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-303 of this
Article XI.
   The Board of Trustees may, at any time, refer a plan to the Plan Commission
for consideration and recommendation. In the case of such referral, the Plan
Commission shall return its recommendation to the Board of Trustees not later
than 90 days following the receipt of the referral. In the event such
recommendation is not so delivered, the Board of Trustees may proceed to
consider the amendment without such recommendation.
   When satisfied that a plan or a part thereof is adequate for adoption as or
amendment of the Official Comprehensive Plan of the Village or a part thereof,
the Plan Commission shall transmit such plan or part thereof to the Board of
Trustees together with its recommendations for adoption of such plan as well as
any reports or statements deemed necessary to a full consideration of such plan
or part thereof. Such reports or statements may include majority and minority
positions. Such transmittal shall be made not later than 15 days following the
close of the public hearing concerning such plan.

Commission with respect to the adoption or amendment of any plan or a part
thereof, the Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly enacted, may adopt such plan
in whole or in part, with or without amendments; or may refer such plan or any
part thereof back to the Plan Commission for further consideration; or may
reject such plan. The Board of Trustees shall take such action not later than
90 days following the close of the Plan Commission public hearing on such plan.
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within such period shall be deemed
to be a rejection of the plan. Upon the adoption of any such plan or part
thereof, it shall be designated as the "Official Comprehensive Plan of the
Village of Hinsdale" and, if less than a total comprehensive plan, shall carry
a subheading designating its specific contents.
      3.   Plan amendment. The Official Comprehensive Plan, or any part
thereof, may be amended at any time in accordance with the provisions of this
Paragraph 3. Such an amendment may be initiated by the Board of Trustees, the
Plan Commission, the Village Manager, or by any owner of property affected by
the provisions of such plan sought to be amended. Amendments initiated by the
Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, or the Village Manager shall require no
formal application and shall be processed as provided in Paragraphs E1 and E2
of this Section. Amendments initiated by the owner of affected property shall

maps, standards, and specifications of and for existing and proposed rights-of-
way, streets, alleys, utility easements, public grounds, and public utility
systems within the Village or within the unincorporated area lying within one

prepared and recommended by the Plan Commission with the advice and assistance
of the Village Manager and the Village Manager's staff, and adopted by the
Board of Trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together with such amendments
thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The term "Official Map" also shall
refer to any internally consistent and complete portion of such a compilation
relating to any one or more of the aforesaid subjects or to any specific
portion of the aforesaid geographical area. As of the effective date of this
Code, the term "Official Map" shall be understood to refer to the documents

of said fee. By signing the application, the owner shall be deemed to have
agreed to pay such fee and to consent to the filing and foreclosure of a lien
on the subject property to ensure collection of any such fee, plus the costs of
collection, in the event such fee has not been properly paid as required with
the filing of the application. Any lien filed pursuant to this Subsection may
be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or mechanics'
liens.
      2.   Recoverable costs. The costs incurred by the Village in processing
an application shall be deemed to consist at least of the following items of
direct and indirect expense:
         (a)   Legal Publication (direct cost);
         (b)   Recording Secretarial Services (direct cost);
         (c)   Court Reporter (direct cost);
         (d)   Document Preparation and Review (hourly salary times a
multiplier to be established from time to time by administrative order of the
Village Manager at a level sufficient to recover 100 percent of the direct and
indirect cost of such service);
         (e)   Copy Reproduction (direct cost);
         (f)   Document Recordation (direct cost);
         (g)   Inspection Fees (direct cost);
         (h)   Professional and technical consultant services (direct cost);
and
         (i)   Legal review, consultation, and advice (direct) cost).
      3.   Condition of all applications, approvals, and permits; time periods.
No application filed pursuant to this code shall be considered complete unless
and until all fees due pursuant to this Subsection have been paid. Every
approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this Code, whether or not
expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned upon payment of
fees as required by this Subsection.
   When this Code provides that the passage of time without decision or action
shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation for approval, all time periods
shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue
to run.
   The failure to fully pay any such fee when due shall be grounds for refusing
to process an application and for denying or revoking any permit or approval
sought or issued with respect to the land or development to which the unpaid
fee relates.
      4.   Waiver for specified public bodies. The provisions of this
Subsection
11-301D may be waived by the Board of Trustees for fees applicable to any
application filed by any public body, or any agency deriving the majority of
its revenues from taxes levied within the Village or any charitable or
eleemosynary organization.
      5.   Notification. The Village shall notify an applicant when the costs
incurred in processing that applicant's application surpass $5,000, and shall
thereafter notify such applicant when such costs surpass each $500 increment
grater than $5,000. The failure of the Village to notify any such applicant
shall not relieve such applicant of the duty to pay all such costs and shall
not prevent the Village from assessing and collecting all such costs.
      6.   Hardship. The Village Manager, in his or her sole discretion, may
reduce or waive any fee required pursuant to this Subsection
11-301D, but only after a showing, in writing, by the Applicant of a particular
hardship caused by the application of such fee.
   E.   Minimum data requirements. Every application submitted pursuant to this
Code shall contain such information as is required by the Village from time to
time. Application requirements shall be established by administrative order and
shall be made available to all applicants in the office of the Village Manager.
   F.   Special data requests. In addition to the data and information required
pursuant to Subsection E of this Section, every applicant shall submit such
other and additional data, information, or documentation as the Village Manager
or any board or commission before which its application is pending may deem
necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of
the particular application.
   G.   Waiver of application requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section, the Village Manager shall have the authority to waive any
requirement set forth in Subsections A, B, C, or E of this Section when, in his
or her judgment, such waiver is appropriate in light of the nature and extent
of the relief being sought or in light of special circumstances making
compliance with those provisions either unnecessary or unduly burdensome;
provided, however, that any board or commission before which such application
may come shall continue to have the right to request additional information
pursuant to Subsection F of this Section and to delay processing of such
application until such information is provided and available in accordance with
the deadlines established in Subsection C of this Section. The Village Manager
shall provide, in writing, his or her reasons why any such requirement has been
waived, and shall refer such writing to the appropriate boards and commissions.
   H.   Concurrent applications. When a proposed use or development requires
more than one approval pursuant to this Code, applications for all such
approvals may be filed concurrently notwithstanding the fact that approval of
one application may be a precondition to approval of other applications. Such
applications may, in the discretion of the official, officials, body, or bodies
charged with review of such applications be processed together; provided,
however, that no application shall be approved unless all applications that are
a precondition to its approval have first been approved.
   I.   Withdrawal of application. An applicant may withdraw an application at
any time prior to a final decision having been rendered with respect thereto,
provided that the applicant shall have paid all applicable fees pursuant to
Subsection
11-301D of this Code. Such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the
applicant's right to refile such application, but any such refiling shall be
treated as an entirely new filing and shall be subject to the procedures and
fees of this Code in the same manner as any other new application. (Ord. No.
92-20, §§2, 3, 7-7-92)
Sec. 11-302: Successive applications:
   A.   Second applications without new grounds barred. Whenever any
application filed pursuant to this Code has been finally denied on its merits,
a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the
same form or on the same theory, shall not be brought unless in the opinion of
the officer, board, or commission before which it is brought there is
substantial new evidence available or a mistake of law or fact significantly
affected the prior denial.
   B.   New grounds to be stated. Any such second application shall include a
detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such application.
   C.   Summary denial with or without hearing. Any such second application may
be denied by the Village Manager summarily, and without hearing, on a finding
that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where such
application is set for hearing, the applicant shall be required to establish
grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application prior to
being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds are
established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such failure.
   D.   Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second
application filed more than two years after the final denial of a prior
application shall be heard on the merits as though no prior application had
been filed. The applicant shall, however, be required to place in the record
all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have
developed since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such
evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.
Sec. 11-303: Public hearings and meetings:
   A.   Setting hearing or meeting; time limitation. When the provisions of
this Code require a public hearing or public meeting in connection with any
application filed pursuant to this Code, the body charged with conducting the
hearing or meeting shall, upon receipt of a properly completed application, fix
a reasonable time and place for such hearing or meeting; provided, however,
that such hearing or meeting shall be commenced no later than 60 days, and
shall be concluded no later than 120 days, following the submission of the
subject application unless the applicant shall agree to an extension or unless
the hearing or meeting agenda of the body is completely committed during that
time.
   B.   Notice.
      1.   Manager to give notice. The Village Manager shall cause notice to be
given of public hearings and public meetings set pursuant to Subsection A of
this Section in the form and manner and to the persons herein specified.
      2.   Content of notice. All notices shall include the date, time and

automatically expire on December 31 of the year in which it is made unless a
written request for renewal, accompanied by the annual fee, is submitted prior
to such date.
            (iii)   By mail, personal delivery, or interdepartmental delivery
to affected Village boards, commissions, departments, officials and
consultants.
Notice by mail as herein required shall be mailed no fewer than seven days in

addition to notice as required by Subparagraph B3(a) of this Section, notice of
every hearing set pursuant to Subsection A of this Section in connection with
any application for an amendment to this Code or the Zoning Map, a special use
permit, or a variation shall be given:
            (i)   By publication in a newspaper published in the Village at
least once no less than 15 days nor more than 30 days in advance of the hearing
date.
            (ii)   If a specific parcel is the subject of the application, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery to all owners of
property within 250 feet of the subject property. Notice as required by this
Subparagraph shall be given by the applicant not less than 15 days nor more
than 30 days in advance of the hearing.
            (iii)   If a specific parcel is the subject of application, by
posting a sign on the subject property. Such sign shall be at least six square
feet in area; shall bear on its face the words "Zoning Application Pending" and
a telephone number to be called for additional information; shall be issued by
the Village Manager to the applicant for posting by the applicant; shall be
posted on the property, facing the street, at least 15 days prior to the date
set for a hearing on the application; and shall be removed from the property
and returned to the Village Manager by the applicant following, but not before,
the conclusion of the hearing.
         (c)   Hearing on official comprehensive plan. In addition to notice as
required by Subparagraph B3(a) of this Section, notice of every hearing set

amendment of the Official Comprehensive Plan shall be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in DuPage and Cook Counties at least 15 days
before such hearing.
   C.   Referral to village commissions and departments.
      1.   Manager to refer applications. The Village Manager, not later than
the time set pursuant to Subsection B of this Section for giving public notice,
shall refer every application for which this Code requires a hearing before
either the Plan Commission, the Zoning Board of Appeals, or the Historic
Preservation Commission to all appropriate Village commissions and departments.
      2.   Review and comments. Each Village commission and department to which
an application is referred pursuant to this Subsection shall review such
application and submit its comments thereon to the Staff Secretary of the
hearing body for presentation to that body at the hearing to be held on such
application. Such comments shall, whenever possible, be submitted at least two
business days prior to the date set for the hearing and shall be made available
to any person on request prior to the hearing.
   D.   Conduct of hearings
      1.   Rights of all persons. Any person may appear and testify at a public
hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney, and may
submit documentary evidence; provided, however, that the hearing body may
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
      2.   Rights Of Parties And Proximate Owners: Subject to the discretion of
the hearing body, the applicant, any board, commission, department, or official
of the village, and any property owner entitled to written notice pursuant to
subsection B3(b)(ii) of this section may be allowed, in addition to the rights
granted by subsection D1 of this section, any or all of the following rights:
         (a)   To present witnesses on their behalf.
         (b)   To cross examine all witnesses testifying in opposition to their
position.
         (c)   To examine and reproduce any documents produced at the hearing.
         (d)   To have subpoenas issued by the body in charge of the hearing as
may be provided by state law for persons to appear at the hearings and for
examination of documents by the person requesting the subpoena either before or
during the hearing, where such persons or documents are shown to have a
substantial evidentiary connection with:
            (i)   The property to which the request applies; or
            (ii)   Facts that would support or negate the legal standards for
granting the request.
         (e)   To a continuance, upon request, for the purpose of presenting
evidence to rebut evidence introduced by any other person.
In determining whether to grant or withhold such rights, the discretion of the
hearing body shall be governed by the goal of securing all information and
opinion relevant and material to its deliberations. Such rights shall not be
granted, however, when undue and unwarranted delay would result, or when to do
so would tend to produce no new evidence to aid the hearing body in reaching
its decision.
      3.   Adjournment Of Hearing: The body conducting the hearing may at any
time, on its own motion or at the request of any person, adjourn the hearing
for a reasonable time and to a fixed date, time, and place, for the purpose of
giving further notice, taking further evidence, gathering further information,
deliberating further, or for such other reason as the hearing body may find to
be sufficient. The staff secretary of the hearing body shall notify in writing
all members of the hearing body, all parties to the hearing, and any other
person designated on the vote of adjournment of the date, time, and place of
the adjourned hearing.
      4.   Testimony To Be Sworn: All testimony at any hearing held pursuant to
the provisions of this code shall be given under oath.
      5.   Right To Submit Written Statements: Any person may at any time prior
to the commencement of a hearing hereunder, or during such hearing, or within
such time as may be allowed by the hearing body following such hearing, submit
written statements in support of or in opposition to the application being
heard.
      6.   Board Or Commission Rules To Govern: All other matters pertaining to
the conduct of hearings shall be governed by the provisions of this code
pertaining to, and the rules promulgated by, the body conducting the hearing.
   E.   Prehearing And Premeeting Examination And Copying Of Application And
Other Documents: At any time following the giving of notice as required in
subsection B of this section, and upon reasonable request, any person may
examine the application and, subject to the exceptions set forth in the
Illinois freedom of information act, all other documents on file with the
office of the village manager pertaining to the matter subject to such notice.
In addition, any person shall be entitled to copies of such application and
documents upon reasonable request and payment of a fee as established from time
to time by the village manager to cover the cost of such copies. (1991 Code)
PART IV. ZONING CERTIFICATES
Sec. 11-401: Certificate Of Zoning Compliance:
   A.   Authority: The village manager shall have authority to issue
certificates of zoning compliance, but only in accordance with the provisions
of this section.
   B.   Purpose: The certificate of zoning compliance is intended to serve two
(2) general purposes. First, it provides a procedure for reviewing plans for
conformance with this code and a means for evidencing such conformance. Second,
it serves as an adjunct to, and thus must be filed prior to or with, all other
applications filed pursuant to this code with respect to a specific use or
development proposal. When so filed, it serves as a vehicle for routine plan
review by the village manager prior to consideration of special requests by
other officials, boards, and commissions, thus avoiding needless special
reviews of defective plans.
   C.   Certificate Required: Unless a certificate of zoning compliance shall
be first obtained from the village manager, except for permits for improvements
expressly waived in this section or expressly waived by another provision of
this code:
      1.   The construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving
of any structure, except signs, shall not be commenced; and
      2.   No land vacant on the effective date of this code shall be used or
occupied for any purpose, except the raising of crops; and
      3.   The grading, excavation, or improvement of land preliminary to any
construction on or use of such land, other than those associated with landscape
improvements, shall not be commenced; and
      4.   Building or other permits pertaining to the construction,
reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of any structure or the use
of any land or structure, excluding permits for:
         (a)   Suppression/detection;
         (b)   Replacement of existing mechanical equipment;
         (c)   Fences;
         (d)   Interior remodeling (when no new living space is created);
         (e)   Roofing;
         (f)   Irrigation;
         (g)   Elevators;
         (h)   Electrical (when no other work and/or permit would be required);
         (i)   Plumbing (when no other work and/or permit would be required),
shall not be issued by the village; and
      5.   No home occupation shall be established or maintained; and
      6.   No temporary use shall be established or maintained, except as
provided in subsection
9-103C1 of this code; and
      7.   No land shall be annexed to the village.
In any case where a certificate of zoning compliance is not required under this
code, the manager shall, on written request, issue a certificate of such fact.
   D.   Relation To Other Applications: No application filed pursuant to part
III of this article with respect to a specific use or development proposal
shall be processed unless an application for a certificate of zoning compliance
shall first have been received, processed, and approved, or denied solely on
one or more grounds that form the basis for the application filed pursuant to
part III of this article. It is the intent of this section that no application
filed pursuant to part III of this article with respect to a specific use or
development proposal shall be processed until the village manager is satisfied
that the proposed use or development complies with the provisions of this code
in all respects except those within the scope of such application.
   E.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: Applications for certificate of zoning compliance shall
be filed in accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article.
      2.   Action On Application: Within thirty (30) days following receipt of
a completed application for a certificate of zoning compliance, the village
manager shall cause the application and related submissions to be reviewed for
compliance with this code and shall inform the applicant whether the
application has been granted or denied. In any case where an application is
granted, the manager shall issue a certificate of zoning compliance, which
shall state on its face, in bold type, that:
      THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT SIGNIFY BUILDING CODE REVIEW OR APPROVAL AND IS
NOT AUTHORIZATION TO UNDERTAKE ANY WORK WITHOUT SUCH REVIEW AND APPROVAL WHERE
EITHER IS REQUIRED. SEE THE HINSDALE BUILDING CODE FOR DETAILS.
      BEFORE ANY STRUCTURE TO WHICH THIS CERTIFICATE IS APPLICABLE MAY BE
OCCUPIED OR USED FOR ANY PURPOSE, A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY MUST BE OBTAINED.
SEE SECTION 11-402 OF THE HINSDALE ZONING CODE AND THE HINSDALE BUILDING CODE
FOR DETAILS.
      In any case where an application is denied, the manager shall state the
specific reasons therefor and shall cite the specific provisions of this code
upon which such denial is based. If relief from such demand would be available
pursuant to a companion application filed in connection with the application
for a certificate of zoning compliance, the manager shall so inform the
applicant and shall promptly process such companion application. If such
application is approved, the manager shall issue the requested certificate of
zoning compliance in accordance with the terms and conditions of such approval.
      If relief from the manager's denial of a certificate of zoning compliance
would be available by variation, special permit, or site plan review, but no
application therefor has been filed, the manager shall so state and shall refer
the applicant to the appropriate provisions of this code.
      3.   Contents Of Certificate: Each certificate of zoning compliance
issued pursuant to this section shall state the specific use of the subject
property for which it is issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any,
pursuant to which it is issued, and shall set forth any conditions imposed in
connection with any approval granted pursuant to this code.
      4.   Filing Of Certificates: Every certificate issued pursuant to this
section shall be kept on file in the office of the village manager and shall be
a public record open to inspection in accordance with the provisions of the
Illinois freedom of information act.
   F.   Effect Of Issuance Of Certificate Of Zoning Compliance: The issuance of
a certificate of zoning compliance shall not authorize the establishment,
expansion, or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
relocation, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for
any additional permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and
ordinances of the village, including, but not limited to, a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
   G.   Limitations On Certificates: Subject to an extension of time granted by
the village manager pursuant to subsection
11-101K of this article, a certificate of zoning compliance shall become null
and void twelve (12) months for single-family detached structures and eighteen
(18) months for multiple-family and commercial structures after the date on
which it was issued unless within such period construction, reconstruction,
remodeling, alteration, or moving of a structure is commenced or a use is
commenced.
   H.   Void Certificates: Any certificate of zoning compliance issued in
violation of the provisions of this code, whether intentionally, negligently,
or innocently, shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights
whatsoever. (1991 Code; Ord. O2006-82, §2, 11-28-2006; Ord. O2015-09, 3-17-
2015)
Sec. 11-402: Certificate Of Occupancy:
   A.   Authority: The village manager shall have authority to issue
certificates of occupancy; provided, however, that no such certificate shall be
issued except in accordance with the provisions of this section and the
provisions of the village code of Hinsdale governing development, building, and
related matters.
   B.   Purpose: For the purposes of this code, the certificate of occupancy
provides a procedure for the inspection of completed premises to ensure their
compliance with this code and approved plans prior to commencement of the use
or occupancy of such premises. The certificate may also evidence compliance
with other provisions of the village code of Hinsdale as set forth in those
provisions.
   C.   Certificate Required: Unless a certificate of occupancy shall have
first been obtained certifying compliance with the provisions of this code:
      1.   No structure, or addition thereto, constructed, reconstructed,
remodeled, altered, or moved after the effective date of this code shall be
occupied or used for any purpose; and
      2.   No land vacant as of the effective date of this code shall be used
or occupied for any purpose, except the raising of crops; and
      3.   Except for changes involving only substitution of occupants in
existing dwelling units, no use or occupancy of any land or structure shall be
changed to any other use or occupancy, whether or not construction, remodeling,
alteration, or moving is involved; and
      4.   No home occupation shall be established.
      This subsection shall not apply to signs regulated by section
9-106 of this code.
   D.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: When no certificate of zoning compliance is required,
applications for certificate of occupancy shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of section
11-301 of this article. When a certificate of zoning compliance has been
issued, the application for that certificate shall also be treated as the
application for a certificate of occupancy and shall be processed as such at
such time as the applicant notifies the village manager in writing that the
subject structure or use is ready for a certificate of occupancy in accordance
with the certificate of zoning compliance.
      In any case where the structure or use involved has been constructed or
established pursuant to any approval granted pursuant to this code, the
application shall be accompanied by "as built" plans depicting the structure or
use as built and bearing the certificate of a surveyor, engineer, architect,
land planner, or owner-designer, as may be appropriate, certifying that the
structure or use as built conforms in all respects to the approval granted.
      2.   Action On Application: Within ten (10) days following the receipt of
a completed application, the village manager shall cause the subject structure
or premises to be inspected and shall take one of the following actions based
on such inspection:
         (a)   If all work has been completed and the structure and use thereof
are in full and complete compliance with all applicable provisions of this
code, other relevant codes and ordinances of the village, the applicant's plans
as approved, and any conditions attached to any approval issued pursuant to
this code, the village manager shall issue a certificate of occupancy.
         (b)   If, however, all work is not complete or is in any manner not in
full compliance with all applicable requirements, the village manager shall
deny the application and shall inform the applicant in writing of the specific
deficiencies on which such denial is based, citing the particular provisions of
the codes and ordinances of the village, the particular items in the
applicant's plans or the applicable special approval conditions with respect to
which compliance is lacking.
      3.   Contents Of Certificate: In addition to the matters required to be
contained in a certificate of occupancy pursuant to other applicable provisions
of the village code, each certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this
section shall state the specific use of the subject property for which it is
issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any, pursuant to which it is
issued, and shall set forth any conditions imposed in connection with any
approval granted pursuant to this code.
      4.   Filing Of Certificates: Every certificate of occupancy issued
pursuant to this section shall be kept on file in the office of the village
manager and shall be a public record open to inspection pursuant to the
provisions of the Illinois freedom of information act.
   E.   Temporary Certificate Of Occupancy: Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsection D2 of this Section, when construction, reconstruction, remodeling,
or alteration of a structure does not require the vacating of the structure, or
when parts of the structure are finished and ready for occupancy before the
completion of such construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or alteration and
are certified upon inspection to be safe for use or occupancy and to be in full
compliance with all applicable provisions of this Code, other relevant codes
and ordinances of the Village, the applicant's plans as approved and any
conditions attached to any approvals issued pursuant to this Code with respect
to such structure or its premises, a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be
issued for a period not to exceed six months from its date, which Temporary
Certificate shall bear on its face, in bold type, a statement of its temporary
nature; provided, however, that no such Temporary Certificate shall be issued
pursuant to this Code unless said structure also qualifies for a Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy issued pursuant to the Hinsdale Building Code.
   F.   Certificate of occupancy for existing uses. The Village Manager may
issue a Certificate of Occupancy certifying the lawful existence and use of any
existing structure or use in the same manner, and subject to the same standards
and limitations, as authorized by this Section with respect to new structures
and uses. Such Certificate of Occupancy shall be prima facie evidence of the
facts contained in it with respect to any structure or use as of the date of
its issue and remain effective for that purpose for so long as neither the use
or structure nor the applicable provisions of this Code are changed.
   G.   Void certificates. Any Certificate of Occupancy issued in violation of
the provisions of this Code, whether intentionally, negligently, or innocently,
shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever.
PART V. INTERPRETATIONS, APPEALS, AND VARIATIONS
Sec. 11-501: Interpretations:
   A.   Authority. The Village Manager, subject to the procedures, standards,
and limitations of this Section, may render interpretations, including use
interpretations, of the provisions of this Code and of any rule or regulation
issued pursuant to it.
   B.   Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this Section is
intended to recognize that the provisions of this Code, though detailed and
lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they may
have to be applied. Many such situations, however, can be readily addressed by
an interpretation of the specific provisions of this Code in light of the
general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted.
Because the interpretation authority herein established is an administrative
rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the
essential content of this Code but rather is intended only to allow
authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
   C.   Parties entitled to seek interpretations. Applications for
interpretations may be filed by any person having an interest in the
circumstances giving rise to the need for an interpretation; provided, however,
that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on
hypothetical facts or where the interpretation would have no effect other than
as an advisory opinion.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for interpretations of this Code shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 11-301 of this Code.
      2.   Action on application. Within 30 days following the receipt of a
properly completed application for interpretation, the Village Manager shall
inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating the
specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the determination is
based. The failure of the Manager to act within 30 days, or such further time
to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the
application rendered on the day following such 30-day period.
      3.   Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Village Manager
may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided in Section 11-502 of
this Code.
   E.   Standards for use interpretations. The following standards shall govern
the Village Manager, and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals from the
Manager, in issuing use interpretations:
      1.   No use interpretation shall be given with respect to the residential
districts.
      2.   Any use defined in Section 12-206 of this Code shall be interpreted
as therein defined.
      3.   No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use
or a special permit use in any district to be established in any district in
which such use is not so listed.
      4.   No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless
evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with each use
limitation established for that particular district.
      5.   No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district
unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in such
district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses permitted or
specially permitted in a more restrictive district.
      6.   If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a
special use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use
interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a
special use permit for such use pursuant to Section 11-602 of this Code.
      7.   No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that
would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in
question.
      8.   Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, in rendering
use interpretations the Village Manager shall be guided by the Standard
Industrial Classification Manual and the use classification methodology used
therein.
   F.   Effect of favorable use interpretation. No use interpretation finding a
particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district
shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, a special use
permit, a Certificate of Zoning Compliance, a Building Permit, a Certificate of
Occupancy, subdivision approval, and Site Plan approval.
   G.   Limitations on favorable use interpretations. Subject to an extension
of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code, no use interpretation finding a particular use to be
permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall be valid for a
period longer than six months from the date of issue unless a building permit
is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a Certificate of Occupancy is
obtained and a use commenced within that period.
A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially
permitted in a particular district shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to
authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has
not been issued. Such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any
force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any
reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
Sec. 11-502: Appeals:
   A.   Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals
from, and review orders, decisions, determinations, or the failure to act, of
the Village Manager acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under
this Code and to that end the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the same
powers and be subject to the same standards and limitations as the village
manager with respect to any order, decision, or determination being appealed.
   B.   Purpose: The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against
arbitrary, ill considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It is
intended to avoid the need for resort to legal action by establishing local
procedures to review and correct administrative errors. It is not, however,
intended as a means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this
code or the rightful authority of the village manager to enforce the
requirements of this code. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all
proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied in the language of this code
and to the reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with
the administration of this code.
   C.   Parties Entitled To Appeal: An application for appeal to the zoning
board of appeals may be filed by any person aggrieved or adversely affected by
an order, decision, determination, or failure to act of the village manager
acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under this code.
   D.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: An application for appeal to the zoning board of
appeals shall be filed not later than forty five (45) days following the action
being appealed and in accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article.
      2.   Action By Village Manager: Upon receipt of a properly completed
application for an appeal, the village manager shall forthwith transmit to the
zoning board of appeals the application together with all papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
      3.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
      4.   Action By Zoning Board Of Appeals: Within thirty (30) days following
the close of the public hearing, the zoning board of appeals shall render a
decision on the appeal in the manner and form specified in subsection
11-102H of this article. Such decision may reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole
or in part, the action appealed from and may include such order or
determination as, in the opinion of the board of appeals, is proper to be made
in the premises. The failure of the board of appeals to act within such thirty
(30) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision denying the appeal.
   E.   Stay Of Proceedings: An application for appeal properly filed pursuant
to subsection D of this section shall stay all proceedings in the furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the village manager certifies to the zoning
board of appeals after the application for appeal has been filed with the
manager that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
the manager's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which
may be granted by the board of appeals or by the circuit court on application,
upon reasonable written notice to the manager and on due cause shown.
   F.   Right To Grant Variation In Deciding Appeals: In any case where the
application for appeal is accompanied by an application for variation in
accordance with section
11-503 of this part, the zoning board of appeals shall have the authority to
grant, as part of the relief, a variation, but only in strict compliance with
each provision of said section
11-503 of this part.
   G.   Conditions And Limitations On Rights Granted By Appeal: In any case
where this code imposes conditions and limitations upon any right, any such
right granted by the zoning board of appeals on appeal shall be subject to such
conditions and limitations in the same manner and to the same extent as if
secured without the necessity of an appeal. (1991 Code)
Sec. 11-503: Variations:
   A.   Authority: The zoning board of appeals shall have the authority to
grant variations from the provisions of this code, but only in compliance with
the procedures set forth in subsection D of this section and in those specific
instances enumerated in subsection E of this section and then only in
accordance with each of the standards enumerated in subsection F of this
section. The board of trustees shall have the authority to grant variations
from the provisions of this code that are not specifically reserved with the
zoning board of appeals pursuant to subsection E of this section in accordance
with each of the standards set forth in subsections E2 and F of this section,
but only after a public hearing before the zoning board of appeals pursuant to
the requirements of section
11-301 of this article and a recommendation by the zoning board of appeals to
grant or deny the requested variation. In such instances, the zoning board of
appeals shall issue its recommendation within thirty five (35) days of the
close of the public hearing in the manner and form specified by subsection
11-102H of this article. The failure of the zoning board of appeals to act
within thirty five (35) days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation to deny the variation. If the
zoning board of appeals does not approve, with at least four (4) affirmative
votes, the requested variation, the board of trustees cannot approve the
requested variation.
   B.   Purpose: The variation procedure is intended to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen particular
applications of this code that create practical difficulties or particular
hardships. When such difficulties or hardships are more appropriate for remedy,
if at all, pursuant to other provisions of this article, the variation
procedure is necessarily inappropriate.
   C.   Parties Entitled To Seek Variations: Applications for variations may be
filed by the owner of, or person having a contractual interest in, the subject
property.
   D.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: Applications for variations shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article.
      2.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
      3.   Action By Zoning Board Of Appeals: Within thirty five (35) days
following the close of the public hearing, the zoning board of appeals shall
render its decision granting or denying the variation, in the manner and form
specified by subsection
11-102H of this article. The failure of the zoning board of appeals to act
within thirty five (35) days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the variation.
   E.   Authorized Variations:
      1.   Permitted Variations: The zoning board of appeals may vary the
provisions of this code only as provided in this subsection E1. The authority
of the zoning board of appeals to vary the provisions of this code are subject
to the prohibitions set forth in subsection E2 of this section and proof by the
applicant of each of the standards set forth in subsection F of this section.
      Under no circumstances shall the list of permitted variations in this
subsection E1 be construed as an entitlement, right, or claim for any
applicant.
      The zoning board of appeals may vary the provisions of this code in the
following cases and in no others:
         (a)   To reduce the dimension of any required yard, setback, or
building spacing, and to allow structures and uses to be located in any
required yard in addition to, and to a greater degree than, those authorized by
applicable district regulations.
         (b)   To reduce by not more than ten percent (10%) the required lot
width or lot depth of any lot; provided, however, that no such variation shall
permit either the development of more than one dwelling unit in addition to the
number of dwelling units that could be developed in the absence of such a
variation or any increase in the otherwise permitted maximum floor area ratio.
         (c)   To reduce by not more than ten percent (10%) the required lot
area of any lot, and to reduce by fifteen percent (15%) the lot area of any lot
meeting all of the following criteria: 1) the subject lot is a legal
nonconforming lot of record created by plat or deed recorded before 1923; 2)
the subject lot was vacant on January 1, 1991, or became vacant thereafter by
reason of demolition or destruction of a precode structure that is not
authorized to be rebuilt or replaced pursuant to subsection
10-104C of this code; 3) the subject lot has not, at any time after 1960,
immediately abutted a vacant lot with the same owner as the subject lot when
the combination of the vacant lot with the subject lot would have created a lot
meeting the lot size standards then applicable to the subject lot; and 4) the
subject lot has not immediately abutted any vacant lot since January 1, 1991.
No variation pursuant to this subsection shall permit either the development of
more than one dwelling unit in addition to the number of dwelling units that
could be developed in the absence of such a variation or any increase in the
otherwise permitted maximum floor area ratio.
         (d)   To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum
allowable height of a structure in a nonresidential district, but only where
necessary to accommodate variations in grade.
         (e)   To reduce by not more than twenty percent (20%), or one space,
whichever is greater, the minimum number of off street parking spaces or
loading spaces otherwise required.
         (f)   To vary the number of parking or loading spaces required in
connection with a change of use or an increase in use intensity.
         (g)   To increase by not more than twenty percent (20%) the maximum
distance that required parking is permitted to be located from the zoning lot
of the use for which such parking is provided.
         (h)   To allow an increase in height by not more than twenty percent
(20%) of the maximum allowable height for the illumination of residential
recreational facilities.
         (i)   To allow the moving of a precode structure to an extent or in a
manner not permitted by subsection
10-104E of this code.
         (j)   To allow the otherwise prohibited restoration of a partially
damaged or destroyed precode structure or structure devoted to a nonconforming
use.
         (k)   To vary the bulk, yard, and space requirements when a zoning
lot, whether vacant or legally used, is reduced in size, by reason of the
exercise of the right of eminent domain by an authorized governmental body or
by reason of a conveyance made under the specific threat of an eminent domain
proceeding, so that the remainder of said zoning lot, or any structure or use
on said zoning lot, does not conform with one or more of such bulk, yard, or
space requirements of the district in which said zoning lot is located.
         (l)   To allow, for a period not to extend beyond four (4) years
following the effective date of this code:
            (i)   The storage in a parking area in a residential district of
more than the maximum number of class I or II vehicles specified in subsection
9-101D4(e) of this code; or
            (ii)   The storage in a parking area in any required yard in a
residential district of class II vehicles; or
            (iii)   The storage in a parking area in a residential district of
no more than one class III vehicle; or
            (iv)   The provision of buffers and landscaping for class II
vehicles other than those required by subsection
9-107J of this code.
      Every variation granted pursuant to this subsection E1(l) shall run only
to the applicant, as a personal privilege, and only with respect to the
specific vehicle that is the subject of the application.
         (m)   To increase by not more than twenty percent (20%) the maximum
floor area ratio permitted in the R-1 single-family residential district for
any proposed development that was the subject of a variation application filed
with the village and approved by the zoning board of appeals after January 1,
1989, but before the effective date of this code.
         (n)   To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum floor
area ratio permitted in the B-2 central business district.
         (o)   To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum
building coverage permitted in the B-2 central business district.
         (p)   To increase the maximum elevation permitted in the R-1, R-2, R-
3 and R-4 single-family residential districts.
         (q)   To increase by not more than fifteen percent (15%) the maximum
allowable height of a personal wireless services antenna support structure that
is of a tower design.
         (r)   To allow the front of a single-family dwelling to be developed
to face a frontage other than the frontage it is required to face pursuant to
subsection
3-110I of this code.
         (s)   To reduce by more than ten percent (10%) the required lot width
and area of any lot created concurrent with and as part of the terms of an
annexation agreement for the land of which the lot is a part. No variation
pursuant to this subsection shall permit either the development of more than
one dwelling unit in addition to the number of dwelling units that could be
developed in the absence of such a variation or any increase in the otherwise
permitted maximum floor area ratio.
         (t)   To increase the maximum floor area ratio not more than the
minimum amount required to authorize construction on property in the R-1, R-2,
R-3, or R-4 districts of a four hundred forty (440) square foot detached garage
accessory to an existing single-family detached dwelling on the subject
property, but only to replace an existing attached garage and only if all of
the following criteria are met: 1) the existing garage is the only garage on
the subject property, 2) the existing garage is unusable as a garage, in the
determination of the director of public services based on reasonable evidence
provided by the applicant, because of flooding outside of the reasonable
control or correction of the subject property owner, 3) the proposed detached
garage will not exceed a total floor area of four hundred forty (440) square
feet and will comply with every other applicable provision of this code, 4) the
floor area ratio and building coverage of the subject property has not been
increased by expansion of the single-family dwelling for at least ten (10)
years prior to the date of application for the variation.
      2.   Prohibited Variations: Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, no variation shall be granted that:
         (a)   Is intended as a temporary measure only; or
         (b)   Is greater than the minimum variation necessary to relieve the
particular hardship or practical difficulty demonstrated by the applicant.
   F.   Standards For Variations:
      1.   General Standard: No variation shall be granted pursuant to this
section unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the strict
letter of the provisions of this code would create a particular hardship or a
practical difficulty. Such a showing shall require proof that the variation
being sought satisfies each of the standards set forth in this subsection F. In
the interest of preserving buildings or structures with historic,
architectural, or cultural significance within the Village, special
consideration shall be given to requests in which the ordinance prevents the
applicant from reestablishing, restoring, or maintaining a material feature or
significant architectural feature related to a lot or structure, or from
maintaining the architectural integrity of the lot or structure, where the
property hosts a designated landmark pursuant to Title 14 of the Village Code,
or a historically significant structure located within the Historic Overlay
District created by Article VIII, Part II of this Zoning Code and listed in
Appendix 1 to Chapter 14-7 (Historic Overlay Zoning District) of the Village
Code.
      2.   Unique Physical Condition: The subject property is exceptional as
compared to other lots subject to the same provision by reason of a unique
physical condition, including presence of an existing use, structure, or sign,
whether conforming or nonconforming; irregular or substandard shape or size;
exceptional topographical features; or other extraordinary physical conditions
peculiar to and inherent in the subject property that amount to more than a
mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot
rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot.
      3.   Not Self-Created: The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the
result of any action or inaction of the owner, or of the owner's predecessors
in title and known to the owner prior to acquisition of the subject property,
and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a
variation is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of
governmental action, other than the adoption of this code, for which no
compensation was paid.
      4.   Denied Substantial Rights: The carrying out of the strict letter of
the provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the owner of the
subject property of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other lots
subject to the same provision.
      5.   Not Merely Special Privilege: The alleged hardship or difficulty is
not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special
privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other
lots subject to the same provision, nor merely an inability to make more money
from the use of the subject property; provided, however, that where the
standards herein set out exist, the existence of an economic hardship shall not
be a prerequisite to the grant of an authorized variation.
      6.   Code And Plan Purposes: The variation would not result in a use or
development of the subject property that would be not in harmony with the
general and specific purposes for which this code and the provision from which
a variation is sought were enacted or the general purpose and intent of the
official comprehensive plan.
      7.   Essential Character Of The Area: The variation would not result in a
use or development on the subject property that:
         (a)   Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development, or value of property
or improvements permitted in the vicinity; or
         (b)   Would materially impair an adequate supply of light and air to
the properties and improvements in the vicinity; or
         (c)   Would substantially increase congestion in the public streets
due to traffic or parking; or
         (d)   Would unduly increase the danger of flood or fire; or
         (e)   Would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area; or
         (f)   Would endanger the public health or safety.
      8.   No Other Remedy: There is no means other than the requested
variation by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or
remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject
property.
   G.   Variation Less Than Requested: A variation less than or different from
that requested may be granted when the record supports the applicant's right to
some relief but not to the relief requested.
   H.   Conditions On Variations: The zoning board of appeals, or the board of
trustees as the case may be, may impose such specific conditions and
limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping,
screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this
code upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary or
appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and
improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities
and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the resolution
granting the variation. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be
a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
variation.
   I.   Affidavit Of Compliance With Conditions: Whenever any variation
authorized pursuant to this section is made subject to conditions and
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall upon meeting such
conditions file an affidavit with the village manager so stating.
   J.   Effect Of Grant Of Variation: The grant of a variation shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits and approval that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the village including, but not limited to, a certificate of
zoning compliance, a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, subdivision
approval, and site plan approval.
   K.   Limitations On Variations: Subject to an extension of time granted by
the village manager pursuant to subsection
11-101K of this article, no variation from the provisions of this code shall be
valid for a period longer than one year unless a building permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion or unless a certificate of occupancy is issued and a use
is commenced within that period.
   A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or
development for which it was issued and shall automatically expire and cease to
be of any force or effect if such construction or development shall be removed
and not replaced within six (6) months following such removal.
(Ord. O2010-51, 10-19-2010; amd. Ord. O2022-27, § 4, 9-20-2022; Ord. O2025-05,
§ 9, - -2025)
PART VI. AMENDMENTS AND SPECIAL APPROVALS
Sec. 11-601: Amendments:
   A.   Authority: This code and the zoning map may be amended from time to
time by ordinance duly enacted by the board of trustees in accordance with the
procedures set out in this section.
   B.   Purpose: The amendment process established by this section is intended
to provide a means for making changes in the text of this code and in the
zoning map that have more or less general significance or application. It is
not intended to relieve particular hardships nor to confer special privileges
or rights. Rather, it is intended as a tool to adjust the provisions of this
code and the zoning map in light of changing, newly discovered, or newly
important conditions, situations, or knowledge.
   C.   Parties Entitled To Seek Amendments: An application for an amendment
may be filed by the board of trustees, the plan commission, the zoning board of
appeals, the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, any
property to be affected by a proposed amendment to the zoning map, or any
person interested in a proposed amendment to the text of this code.
   D.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: Applications for amendments shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article; provided, however, that amendments proposed by the
board of trustees, the plan commission or the zoning board of appeals shall not
be subject to said section but shall be transmitted to the village manager in
such form as may seem appropriate to the initiating body.
      2.   Preliminary Consideration By Board Of Trustees:
         (a)   Referral To Board: Every properly filed and completed
application for an amendment to this code, before being processed in any other
manner, shall be referred to the board of trustees for a determination as to
whether the application merits a hearing and consideration by the plan
commission or should be summarily denied.
         (b)   Notice Of Applicant; Right To Be Heard: Notice of the meeting at
which the issue will be considered shall be given to the applicant at least
forty eight (48) hours before such meeting and the applicant or his
representative shall, subject to the rules of the board of trustees, have the
right to be heard on the issue.
         (c)   Action By Board: The board of trustees, not later than the first
meeting after the meeting at which the issue first appears on its agenda, shall
either summarily deny the application or refer it to the plan commission for
public hearing. The affirmative vote of four (4) members of the board of
trustees shall be necessary to summarily deny an application; any other vote
shall be sufficient to refer the application for a hearing. In the case of any
such referral, the date of such referral shall be deemed to be the date of
filing for computation of all time periods under this code. A summary denial
shall have the same legal effect as a denial after a full hearing.
         (d)   Standard: In considering the issue of whether to summarily deny
or refer an application for hearing, the board of trustees shall be guided by
the legislative standard that applies to granting an application for an
amendment as set forth in subsection E of this section. The board of trustees
should summarily deny an application in any case where its legislative judgment
is that the standard cannot be met with regard to the proposed amendment.
      3.   Public Hearing: In any case where an application for amendment is
referred to the plan commission for a hearing, a public hearing shall be set,
noticed, and conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
      4.   Action By Plan Commission: Within forty five (45) days following the
conclusion of the public hearing, the plan commission shall transmit to the
board of trustees its recommendation in the form specified by subsection
11-103H of this article. The failure of the plan commission to act within forty
five (45) days following the conclusion of such hearing, or such further time
to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the
approval of the proposed amendment as submitted.
      5.   Action By Board Of Trustees; Protest: Within sixty (60) days
following the receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its
failure to act as above provided, the board of trustees shall either deny the
application or, by ordinance duly adopted, adopt the proposed amendment, with
or without modifications; provided, however, that in the event a duly signed
and acknowledged protest against a proposed amendment is filed with the village
clerk before the adoption of such amendment by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the frontage to be affected by the proposed amendment, or by
the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage immediately
adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be affected,
such amendment shall not be passed except by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all the
trustees then holding office.
   The failure of the board of trustees to act within sixty (60) days, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision
denying the application.
   E.   Standard For Amendments: The wisdom of amending the zoning map or the
text of this code is a matter committed to the sound legislative discretion of
the board of trustees and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in
determining whether a proposed amendment should be granted or denied the board
of trustees should be guided by the principle that its power to amend this code
is not an arbitrary one but one that may be exercised only when the public good
demands or requires the amendment to be made. In considering whether that
principle is satisfied in any particular case, the board of trustees should
weigh, among other factors, the following factors:
      1.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this
code.
      2.   The existing uses and zoning classifications for properties in the
vicinity of the subject property.
      3.   The trend of development in the vicinity of the subject property,
including changes, if any, in such trend since the subject property was placed
in its present zoning classification.
      4.   The extent, if any, to which the value of the subject property is
diminished by the existing zoning classification applicable to it.
      5.   The extent to which any such diminution in value is offset by an
increase in the public health, safety, and welfare.
      6.   The extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent
properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
      7.   The extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties would
be affected by the proposed amendment.
      8.   The extent, if any, to which the future orderly development of
adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
      9.   The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or
permissible under its present zoning classification.
      10.   The availability of adequate ingress to and egress from the subject
property and the extent to which traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity
of the subject property would be affected by the proposed amendment.
      11.   The availability of adequate utilities and essential public
services to the subject property to accommodate the uses permitted or
permissible under its present zoning classification.
      12.   The length of time, if any, that the subject property has been
vacant, considered in the context of the pace of development in the vicinity of
the subject property.
      13.   The community need for the proposed amendment and for the uses and
development it would allow.
      14.   The reasons, where relevant, why the subject property should be
established as part of an overlay district and the positive and negative
effects such establishment could be expected to have on persons residing in the
area. (1991 Code)
Sec. 11-602: Special Use Permits:
   A.   Authority: The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant
special use permits authorizing the development of uses listed as special uses
in the regulations applicable to the district in which the subject property is
located.
   B.   Purpose: Special uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the
desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses
that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a
weighing, in each case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact
and effect.
   C.   Parties Entitled To Seek Special Use Permits: An application for a
special use permit may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a
contractual interest in, the subject property.
   D.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: Applications for special use permits shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article.
      2.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
      3.   Action By Plan Commission: Within forty five (45) days following the
conclusion of the public hearing, the plan commission shall transmit to the
board of trustees its recommendation in the form specified by subsection
11-103H of this article, recommending either granting the application for a
special use permit; granting the application subject to conditions, as
specified in subsection F of this section; or denying the application. The
failure of the plan commission to act within forty five (45) days, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation
for the approval of the proposed special use permit.
      4.   Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days following the
receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the board of trustees shall either deny the application or, by
ordinance duly adopted, shall grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the board of trustees to act within
sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall
be deemed to be a decision denying the special use permit.
   E.   Standards For Special Use Permits:
      1.   General Standards: No special use permit shall be recommended or
granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant shall establish that:
         (a)   Code And Plan Purposes: The proposed use and development will be
in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this code was
enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were
established and with the general purpose and intent of the official
comprehensive plan.
         (b)   No Undue Adverse Impact: The proposed use and development will
not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the
character of the area, or the public health, safety, and general welfare.
         (c)   No Interference With Surrounding Development: The proposed use
and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to
dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations.
         (d)   Adequate public facilities. The proposed use and development
will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as
streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection,
refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or the applicant will provide
adequately for such services.
         (e)   No traffic congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
residential streets.
         (f)   No destruction of significant features. The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural,
scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
         (g)   Compliance with standards. The proposed use and development
complies with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular
provision of this Code authorizing such use.
      2.   Special standards for specified special uses. When the district
regulations authorizing any special use in a particular district impose special
standards to be met by such use in such district, a permit for such use in such
district shall not be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall
establish compliance with such special standards.
      3.   Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Plan Commission
shall consider:
         (a)   Public benefit. Whether and to what extent the proposed use and
development at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable to
provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of the public
convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood
or community.
         (b)   Alternative locations. Whether and to what extent such public
goals can be met by the location of the proposed use and development at some
other site or in some other area that may be more appropriate than the proposed
site.
         (c)   Mitigation of adverse impacts. Whether and to what extent all
steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed
use and development on the immediate vicinity through building design, site
design, landscaping, and screening.
   F.    Conditions on special use permits. The Plan Commission may recommend
and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations concerning
use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other
matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this Code upon the premises
benefitted by a special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate to
prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the
vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services. Such
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special
use. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this
Code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
   G.    Affidavit of compliance with conditions. Whenever any special use
permit granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such
conditions, file an affidavit with the Village Manager so stating.
   H.    Effect of issuance of a special use permit. The grant of a special use
permit shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any other permits or approvals that may be
required by the codes and ordinances of the Village, including but not limited
to a Certificate of Zoning Compliance, a Building Permit, a Certificate of
Occupancy, and subdivision approval.
   I.   Limitations on special use permits. Subject to an extension of time
granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code, no special use permit shall be valid for a period longer
than one year unless a Building Permit is issued and construction is actually
begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or
unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that
period.
   A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use
for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically expire and cease
to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be discontinued
for a period of six consecutive months or more.
   Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance granting a special use
permit, a special use permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the
benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than the owner or operator of
such use or lot.
   J.   Amendments to special use permits. A special use permit may be amended,
varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the standards
and limitations provided in this Section for its original approval.
Sec. 11-603: Planned developments:
   A.   Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this Section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant
special use permits authorizing the development of planned developments, but
only in the districts where such developments are listed as an authorized
special use.
   B.   Purpose. Planned developments are included in this Code as a distinct
category of special use. As such, they are authorized for the same general
purposes as all other special uses. In particular, however, the planned
development technique is intended to allow the relaxation of otherwise
applicable substantive requirements based upon procedural protections providing
for detailed review of individual proposals for significant developments. This
special regulatory technique is included in this Code in recognition of the
fact that traditional bulk, space, and yard regulations that may be useful in
protecting the character of substantially developed and stable areas may impose
inappropriate pre- regulations and rigidities upon the development or
redevelopment of parcels or areas that lend themselves to an individual,
planned approach. Through the flexibility of the planned development technique,
the Village seeks to achieve the following specific objectives:
      1.   Creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible
through strict application of other Village land use regulations.
      2.   Promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities resulting in better design and development, including
aesthetic amenities.
      3.   Combination and coordination of architectural styles, building
forms, and building relationships.
      4.   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such
as natural topography, vegetation, and geologic features, the provision of
screening or other facilities that benefit neighboring properties, and the
prevention of soil erosion.
      5.   Provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space.
      6.   An increase in the amount of open space over that which would result
from the application of conventional subdivision and zoning regulations.
      7.   Encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare.
   C.   Parties entitled to seek planned development approval. An application
for a special permit to permit a planned development may be filed by the owner
of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject property.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Development concept plan.
         (a)   Purpose. The Development Concept Plan is intended to provide the
applicant an opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic scope, character,
and nature of the entire proposed planned development without incurring undue
cost. The Development Concept Plan is the basis on which the required public
hearing is held, thus permitting public consideration of the proposal at the
earliest possible stage.
      To permit the Village and the applicant to proceed with some assurance,
approval of the Development Concept Plan binds the applicant and the Village
with respect to the following basic elements of development:
            (i)   Categories of uses to be permitted; and
            (ii)   General location of residential and nonresidential land
uses; and
            (iii)   Overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity
of nonresidential uses; and
            (iv)   The general architectural style of the proposed development;
and
            (v)   General location and extent of public and private open space
including recreational amenities; and
            (vi)   General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation
systems; and
            (vii)   Staging of development; and
            (viii)   Nature, scope, and extent of public dedications,
improvements, or contributions to be provided by the applicant.
         (b)   Application. Applications for approval of a Development Concept
Plan shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 11-301 of
this Article XI.
         (c)   Public hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section 11-303 of this
Code.
         (d)   Action by plan commission. Within 45 days following the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall transmit to the
Board of Trustees its recommendation, in the form specified by Subsection
11-103F of this Code, that the Development Concept Plan either be approved, be
approved subject to modifications, or not be approved. The failure of the Plan
Commission to act within 45 days, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the Development
Concept Plan as submitted.
         (e)   Action by board of trustees. Within 60 days following the
receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission or its failure to act as
above provided, the Board of Trustees shall deny the application for approval
of the Development Concept Plan, or shall refer it back to the Plan Commission
for further consideration of specified matters, or, by ordinance duly adopted,
shall approve the Development Concept Plan, with or without modifications and
conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of such approval, and
shall grant a special use permit authorizing the proposed planned development
and such additional approvals as may be necessary to permit development of the
planned development as approved; provided, however, that every such ordinance
and special use permit shall be expressly conditioned upon approval of Detailed
and Final Plans in accordance with Paragraphs D3 and D4 of this Section and
upon the permittee's compliance with all provisions of this Code and the
ordinance granting the special use permit.
      The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision
denying approval of the Development Concept Plan.
         (f)   Effect of development concept plan approval. Unless the
applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing Detailed and Final Plans
or shall fail to proceed with development in accordance with the plans as
approved or shall in any other manner fail to comply with any condition of this
Code or any approval granted pursuant to it, the Village shall not, without the
consent of the applicant, take any action to modify, revoke, or otherwise
impair an approved Development Concept Plan with respect to the elements of
development set forth in Subparagraph D1(a) of this Section pending the
application for approval of Detailed and Final Plans. In submitting such plans,
the applicant shall be bound by the approved Development Concept Plan with
respect to each such element.
         (g)   Limitation on development concept plan approval. Subject to an
extension of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code, unless a Detailed Plan covering at least the area
designated in the Development Concept Plan as the first stage or unit of the
planned development has been filed within one year from the date the Board of
Trustees grants Development Concept Plan approval, or in any case where the
applicant fails to file Detailed and Final Plans and to proceed with
development in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the approved
Development Concept Plan, the approval shall automatically expire and be
rendered void and the Manager shall, without further direction, initiate an
appropriate application to revoke the special permit for all portions of the
planned development area that have not yet been completed.
      2.   Optional submission of a detailed plan. The applicant may, at his or
her option, submit a Detailed Plan for the proposed planned development
pursuant to the requirements of Paragraph D3 of this Section simultaneously
with the submission of the Development Concept Plan pursuant to the
requirements of Paragraph D1 of this Section. In such case, the applicant shall
comply with all provisions of this Code applicable to submission of the
Development Concept Plan and to submission of the Detailed Plan. The Plan
Commission and the Board of Trustees shall consider such plans simultaneously
and shall grant or deny Detailed Plan approval in accordance with the
provisions of Paragraph D3 of this Section.
      3.   Detailed plan.
         (a)   Purpose. The Detailed Plan is intended to particularize, refine,
and implement the Development Concept Plan and to serve as a working document
in development of a Final Plan. The Detailed Plan may be submitted for the
entire planned development or in stages as approved in the Development Concept
Plan.
         (b)   Application. Upon approval of the Development Concept Plan, and
within the time limits established in Subparagraph D1(g) of this Section, the
applicant shall file an application for Detailed Plan approval in accordance
with the requirements of Section 11-301 of this Code. The application may
include the entire area included in the approved Development Concept Plan or
one or more stages or units thereof in accordance with a staging plan approved
as part of the Development Concept Plan. The application shall refine,
implement, and be in substantial conformity with the approved Development
Concept Plan.
         (c)   Public meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section 11-303 of this
Code.
         (d)   Coordination with subdivision ordinance. When a subdivision of
land subject to the Hinsdale Subdivision Ordinance is proposed in connection
with a planned development, review of the tentative plat of the proposed
subdivision shall be carried out simultaneously with review of the Detailed
Plan.
         (e)   Action by plan commission.
            (i)   Evaluation. Within 60 days following the filing of an
application for approval of a Detailed Plan, the Plan Commission shall, with
such aid and advice of the Village staff and consultants as may be appropriate,
review and act on the plan. Such review shall consider:
               (1)   Whether the Detailed Plan is in substantial conformity
with the approved Development Concept Plan; and
               (2)   The merit or lack of merit of any departure of the
Detailed Plan from substantial conformity with the approved Development Concept
Plan; and
               (3)   Whether the Detailed Plan complies with any and all
conditions imposed by approval of the Development Concept Plan; and
               (4)   Whether the Detailed Plan complies with the provisions of
this Code and all other applicable federal, State, and Village codes,
ordinances, and regulations.
            (ii)   Approval based on substantial conformity. If the plan
Commission finds substantial conformity between the Detailed Plan and the
approved Development Concept Plan and further finds the Detailed Plan to be in
all other respects complete and in compliance with any and all conditions
imposed by approval of the Development Concept Plan and with the provisions of
this Code and all other applicable federal, State, and Village codes,
ordinances, and regulations, it shall transmit the plan to the Board of
Trustees with its recommendation, in the form specified in Subsection
11-103F of this Code, that the Board of Trustees approve the Detailed Plan,
with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as
a condition of approval; provided, however, that in no event shall such
conditions of approval impair the rights granted by the Development Concept
Plan approval. See Subsection
12-206S of this Code for the definition of "substantial conformity."
            (iii)   Recommendation of approval without substantial conformity.
If the Plan Commission finds that the Detailed Plan lacks substantial
conformity to the Development Concept Plan but merits approval notwithstanding
such lack of conformity and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this
Code, it shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees with its
recommendation, in the form specified in Subsection
11-103F of this Code, that the Detailed Plan be approved, with or without
modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of
approval.
            (iv)   Recommendation of denial. If the Plan Commission finds that
the Detailed Plan is not in substantial conformity with the approved
Development Concept Plan and does not merit approval, or if the Plan Commission
requires modifications of a plan that are not accepted by the applicant, the
Plan Commission shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees together with
its recommendation, in the form specified in Subsection
11-103F of this Code, that the Detailed Plan not be approved.
            (v)   Failure to act. The failure of the Plan Commission to act
within 60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a recommendation to the Board of Trustees to approve the Detailed
Plan as submitted.
         (f)   Action by board of trustees. Within 60 days following the
receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the Board of Trustees shall either:
            (i)   Approval based on substantial conformity. If the Plan
Commission has recommended approval of a Detailed Plan pursuant to Subparagraph
D3(e)(ii) of this Section, the Board of Trustees shall, unless it specifically
rejects one or more of the findings of the Plan Commission on the basis of
expressly stated reasons, approve the Detailed Plan by a duly adopted
ordinance; or
            (ii)   Approval without substantial conformity. In any case other
than that specified in Subparagraph D3(f)(i) of this Section, the Board of
Trustees may, if it finds that the Detailed Plan merits approval and otherwise
conforms to the requirements of this Code, approve the Detailed Plan by a duly
adopted ordinance; or
            (iii)   Referral back to plan commission. In any case other than
that specified in Subparagraph D3(f)(i) of this Section, the Board of Trustees
may refer the Detailed Plan back to the Plan Commission for further
consideration of specified matters; or
            (iv)   Conditions on detailed plan approval. Every approval of a
Detailed Plan shall be expressly conditioned upon approval of a Final Plan in
accordance with Paragraph D4 of this Section and upon the applicant's
compliance with all provisions of this Code, of the ordinance granting
Development Concept Plan approval and of the ordinance granting Detailed Plan
approval. The approval of any Detailed Plan may, in addition, be granted with
or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a
condition of approval; provided, however, that in no event shall such
conditions of approval impair the rights granted by the Development Concept
Plan Approval.
   The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying
Detailed Plan approval.
         (g)   Effect of detailed plan approval. Unless the applicant shall
fail to meet time schedules for filing Final Plans or shall fail to proceed
with development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other
manner fail to comply with any condition of this Code or any approval granted
pursuant to it, the Village shall not, without the consent of the applicant,
take any action to modify, revoke, or otherwise impair an approved Detailed
Plan pending the application for approval of a Final Plan. In submitting a
Final Plan, the applicant shall be bound by the approved Detailed Plan.
         (h)   Limitation on detailed plan approval. Subject to an extension of
time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code unless a Final Plan covering at least the area designated
in the Detailed Plan as the first stage or unit of the planned development has
been filed within three months from the date the Detailed Plan is approved, or
in any case where the applicant fails to file a Final Plan and to proceed with
development in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the approved
Detailed Plan, the approval and all other approvals of the planned development
and all permits based on such approvals shall automatically expire and be
rendered void, and the Manager shall, without further direction, initiate an
appropriate application to revoke the special use permit for all portions of
the planned development area that have not yet been completed.
         (i)   Site improvements; model buildings. At any time following the
approval of a Detailed Plan, the applicant may, pursuant to and subject to the
limitations of all applicable codes and ordinances of the Village, apply for
and receive grading permits and approvals necessary for the installation of
utility and street improvements within the area of the planned development for
which Detailed Plan approval has been given.
   If expressly authorized in the approval of the Detailed Plan, the applicant
may, pursuant to and subject to the limitations of all applicable codes and
ordinances of the Village, apply for and receive building permits for model
buildings to be constructed within the area of the planned development shown on
the approved Detailed Plan.
      4.   Final plan.
         (a)   Purpose. The Final Plan is to serve as a complete, thorough, and
permanent public record of the planned development and the manner in which it
is to be developed. When properly utilized, Final Plan approval is essentially
a clerical step in the planned development process. The documentation required
to be submitted with the Final Plan approval application is intended to reflect
in final form the approved planned development and to incorporate all prior
approved plans and all modifications thereof resulting from the planned
development process.
         (b)   Application. Upon approval of the Detailed Plan, and within the
time limits established in Subparagraph D3(h) of this Section, the applicant
shall file an application for Final Plan approval in accordance with the
requirements of Section 11-301 of this Code. The application may include the
entire area included in the approved Detailed Plan or one or more stages or
units thereof in accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the
Development Concept Plan. The application shall add necessary detail to, and
put in final form, the information contained in the approved Detailed Plan and
shall conform to the approved Detailed Plan in all respects.
         (c)   Coordination with subdivision ordinance. When a subdivision of
land subject to the Hinsdale Subdivision Ordinance is proposed in connection
with a planned development, review of the final plat of subdivision shall be
carried out simultaneously with review of the Final Plan. (d) Final Plan
Review. Within 21 days following the filing of an application for Final Plan
approval, the Village Manager shall cause to be initiated and completed a staff
review of the Final Plan to determine its conformity to the approved Detailed
Plan and its compliance with any conditions imposed by the approval of the
Detailed Plan and with the provisions of this Code and all other applicable
federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
         (d)   Final plan review. Within 21 days following the filing of an
application for Final Plan approval, the Village Manager shall cause to be
initiated and completed a staff review of the Final Plan to determine its
conformity to the approved Detailed Plan and its compliance with any conditions
imposed by the approval of the Detailed Plan and with the provisions of this
Code and all other applicable federal, state, and village codes, ordinances,
and regulations.
   If the Manager shall find conformity in all significant respects between
such plans, and shall further find the Final Plan to be in all other respects
complete and in compliance with any conditions imposed by the approval of the
Detailed Plan and with this Code and all other applicable federal, State, and
Village codes, ordinances, and regulations, then the Manager shall approve the
Final Plan for recording as herein provided.
   If the Manager shall find that the Final Plan lacks such conformity,
completeness, or compliance, then the Manager shall inform the applicant of any
deficiencies in the Final Plan and allow the applicant an opportunity to remedy
such deficiencies. If the applicant shall fail or refuse to remedy such
deficiencies, then the Manager shall refer the Final Plan to the Plan
Commission and the Board of Trustees, which shall then review and approve or
disapprove the Final Plan in the same manner and subject to the same standards
as provided in Subparagraphs D3(e) and (f) of this Section with respect to
Detailed Plans.
         (e)   Recording of final plan. When a Final Plan is approved, the
Village Manager shall cause the Final Plan, or the portions thereof as are
appropriate, to be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of DuPage or Cook
County, whichever is appropriate.
         (f)   Limitation on final plan approval. Construction shall commence
in accordance with the approved Final Plan within one year after the approval
of such plan, or within such shorter time as may be established by the approved
development schedule. Failure to commence construction within such period
shall, unless an extension of time shall have been granted by the Village
Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code, automatically render void the Final Plan approval and all
approvals of the planned development and all permits based on such approvals,
and the Manager shall, without further direction, initiate an appropriate
application to revoke the special use permit for all portions of the planned
development that have not yet been completed.
         (g)   Building and other permits. Except as provided in Subparagraph
D3(i) of this Section, appropriate officials of the Village may upon, but not
before, receiving notice from the Village Manager that the documents required
for Final Plan approval have been approved, and upon proper application by the
applicant, issue building and other permits to the applicant for the
development, construction, and other work in the area encompassed by the
approved Final Plan; provided, however, that no permit shall be issued unless
the appropriate official is first satisfied that the requirements of any codes
or ordinances of the Village, in addition to this Code, that are applicable to
the permit sought, have been satisfied.
   Building permits may, however, be withheld at the discretion of the Village
Manager or the Board of Trustees at any time it is determined that the
development of the planned development is not proceeding in strict compliance
with the approved Final Plan.
   E.   Standards for planned developments.
      1.   Special use permit standards. No special use permit for a planned
development shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this Section unless the
applicant shall establish that the proposed development will meet each of the
standards made applicable to special use permits pursuant to Subsection
11-602E of this Code.
      2.   Additional standards for all planned developments. No special use
permit for a planned development shall be recommended or granted unless the
applicant shall establish that the proposed development will meet each of the
following additional standards:
         (a)   Unified ownership required. The entire property proposed for
planned development treatment shall be in single ownership or under such
unified control as to ensure that the entire property will be developed as a
unified whole. All owners of the property shall be included as joint applicants
on all applications and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of
any owner as to any tract shall be deemed a violation as to all owners and all
tracts.
         (b)   Minimum area. The district regulations of this Code establishing
standards for particular types of planned development specify the minimum area
required for some planned developments. In addition to meeting that specific
standard, or where no specific standard is set, the applicant shall have the
burden of establishing that the subject property is of sufficient size and
shape to be planned and developed as a unified whole capable of meeting the
objectives for which planned developments may be established pursuant to this
Section.
         (c)   Covenants and restrictions to be enforceable by village. All
covenants, deed restrictions, easements, and similar restrictions to be
recorded in connection with the planned development shall provide that they may
not be modified, removed, or released without the express consent of the Board
of Trustees and that they may be enforced by the Village as well as by future
landowners within the proposed development.
         (d)   Public open space and contributions. Whenever the Official
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Map, or Official Map indicates that development of a
planned development will create a need for land for public purposes of the
Village within the proposed planned development, the Board of Trustees may
require that such area be designated and to the extent such need is
specifically and uniquely attributable to the proposed development, dedicated
to the Village for such use. In addition, the Board of Trustees may require
evidence that all requirements of Village ordinances pertaining to the
dedication of land or the contribution of cash in connection with subdivisions
or developments of land have been met as respects the proposed planned
development.
         (e)   Common open space.
            (i)   Amount, location, and use. The failure of a planned
development to provide common open space shall be considered to be an
indication that it has not satisfied the objectives for which such developments
may be approved pursuant to this Code. When common open space is provided in a
planned development, the amount and location of such open space shall be
consistent with its intended function as set forth in the application and
planned development plans. No such open space shall be used for the
construction of any structure or improvement except such structures and
improvements as may be approved in the Final Plan as appropriate to the
intended leisure and recreational uses for which such open space is intended.
            (ii)   Preservation. Adequate safeguards, including recorded
covenants or dedication of development rights, shall be provided to prevent the
subsequent use of common open space for any use, structure, improvement, or
development other than that shown on the approved Final Plan. The restrictions
must be permanent and not for a given period of years and must run with the
land. Such covenants and dedications may provide that they may be released, but
only with the express written consent of the Board of Trustees.
            (iii)   Ownership and maintenance. The Final Plan shall include
such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of such open space and
improvements as are reasonably necessary to ensure their continuity, care,
conservation, maintenance, and operation in accordance with predetermined
standards and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the Village
if such open space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate or are not
maintained in a condition consistent with the best interests of the planned
development or the Village.
            (iv)   Property owners' association. When the requirements of the
preceding Subparagraph are to be satisfied by the ownership or maintenance of
such open space or improvements by a property owners' association, such
association shall meet each of the following standards:
               (1)   The by-laws and rules of the association and all
declarations, covenants, and restrictions to be recorded must be approved as
part of the Detailed Plan prior to becoming effective. Each such document shall
provide that it shall not be amended in any manner that would result in it
being in violation of the requirements of this subparagraph; and
               (2)   The association must be established and all covenants and
restrictions must be recorded prior to the sale of any property within the area
of the planned development designated to have the exclusive use of the proposed
open space or improvements; and
               (3)   The association must be responsible for casualty and
liability insurance, taxes, and the maintenance of the open space and
improvements to be deeded to it; and
               (4)   Membership in the association must be mandatory for each
property owner and any successive owner having a right to the use or enjoyment
of such open space or improvements; and
               (5)   Every property owner having a right to the use or
enjoyment of such open space or improvements must pay its pro rata share of the
cost of the association by means of an assessment to be levied by the
association that meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in
accordance with statutes of the state of Illinois; and
               (6)   The association must have the right to adjust the
assessment to meet changed needs. The membership vote required to authorize
such adjustment shall not be fixed at more than two- thirds (2/3) of the
members voting on the issue; and
               (7)   The village must be given the right to enforce the
covenants; and
               (8)   The village must be given the right, after ten (10) days’
written notice to the association, to perform any maintenance or repair work
that the association has neglected to perform, to assess the membership for
such work and to have a lien against the property of any member failing to pay
such assessment. For this purpose alone, the village shall have all the rights
and powers of the association and its governing body under the agreements and
declarations creating the association.
         (f)   Landscaping And Perimeter Treatment: The requirements relating
to buffering and landscaping of a planned development are set forth in Section
9-107  of this Code.
         (g)   Building And Spacing: No part of any building shall be closer to
any part of any other building than ten feet (10'), or three feet (3') if a
fire separation wall has been provided satisfactory to the village manager,
plus one-half foot (½') for each one foot (1') by which either or both of such
buildings exceed twenty five feet (25') in height.
         (h)   Private Streets: Private streets are prohibited unless expressly
approved by the board of trustees. If so approved, they shall meet all
construction standards applicable to public streets. No such streets shall be
approved except upon the condition that they shall be owned and maintained by a
property owners’ association meeting the requirements set forth in subsection
E2(e)(iv) of this section.
         (i)   Sidewalks: A sidewalk meeting the standards of the Hinsdale
subdivision ordinance shall be provided along at least one side of every street
in or abutting a planned development; provided, however, that such sidewalk may
be constructed in a street right of way or as a specific element of the design
of the planned development.
         (j)   Utilities: All utility lines shall be installed underground.
      3.   Additional Standards For Specific Planned Developments: Where the
district regulations authorizing any planned development use in a particular
district impose standards to be met by such planned development in such
district, a special permit for such development shall not be recommended or
granted unless the applicant shall establish compliance with such special
standards.
   F.   Conditions On Planned Development Approvals: The approval of either a
development concept plan or a detailed plan may be conditioned on such matters
as the approving body may find necessary to prevent or minimize any possible
adverse effects of the proposed planned development, or to ensure its
compatibility with surrounding uses and development and its consistency with
the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this code, the Hinsdale
subdivision ordinance, and the official comprehensive plan; provided, however,
that no such condition of detailed plan approval shall impair the rights
granted by development concept plan approval. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance or resolution granting the approval in
question. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of
this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of all approvals granted
for the planned development.
   G.   Affidavit Of Compliance With Conditions: Whenever any planned
development approval granted pursuant to this section is made subject to
conditions or limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant, upon
meeting such conditions, shall file an affidavit with the village manager so
stating.
   H.   Authority To Vary Regulations:
      1.   Authority: Subject to the standards and limitations hereinafter set
forth, the board of trustees shall have the authority, in connection with the
granting of any planned development approval pursuant to this section, to
change, alter, vary, modify, or waive any provisions of the village code of
Hinsdale and the Hinsdale zoning code as they apply to an approved planned
development.
      2.   Standards: No such change, alteration, variation, modification, or
waiver shall be approved unless the board of trustees shall find that the
proposed planned development:
         (a)   Will achieve the purposes for which planned developments may be
approved pursuant to subsection B of this section; and
         (b)   Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of
this code and the official comprehensive plan; and
         (c)   Will result in a development providing compensating amenities to
the village.
      3.   Limitations: Except as provided in subsection H4 of this section, no
such change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver shall be permitted
with respect to the uses permitted in any district or with respect to any
standard established by subsection E of this section or with respect to any
standard made specifically applicable to planned developments by the
regulations of any particular district unless such regulations expressly
authorize such a change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver.
      4.   Cumulative Authority: The variation authority created by this
subsection shall be in addition to the variation authority created by section
11-503 of this article.
   I.   Regulation During And Following Completion Of Development: Following
final plan approval, the final plan, rather than any other provision of this
code, shall constitute the use, parking, loading, sign, bulk, space, and yard
regulations applicable to the subject property, and no use or development,
other than home occupation and temporary uses, not allowed by the final plan
shall be permitted within the area of the planned development pursuant to the
zoning district regulations otherwise applicable to such area.
   J.   Inspections During Development:
      1.   Inspections By Village Manager: Following approval of the final plan
of a planned development or any stage thereof, the village manager, at least
annually until the completion of development, shall review all permits issued
and construction undertaken and compare actual development with the approved
plans for development and with the approved development schedule.
      2.   Action By Village Manager: If the village manager finds that
development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved schedule, or that
it fails in any other respect to comply with the final plan, the manager shall
immediately notify the board of trustees of such fact and may, if necessary to
protect the public health, safety, or welfare or to prevent further violation
of this code and the final plan, issue an order stopping any and all work on
the planned development until such time as any noncompliance is cured.
      3.   Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days following
notification by the village manager, the board of trustees shall either:
         (a)   Take such steps as it deems necessary to compel compliance with
the final plan; or
         (b)   Require the owner or applicant to seek an adjustment to the
final plan during development as provided in subsection K of this section.
      4.   Revocation: Failure of the board of trustees to act within the
aforesaid sixty (60) days shall, unless the owner or applicant shall have cured
the noncompliance within such period, render void the final plan approval of
all uncompleted portions of the planned development, all prior plan approvals
on which such final plan approval depends, and all permits based upon such
approvals, and the village manager shall, without further direction, initiate
an appropriate action to revoke the special permit for all portions of the
planned development that have not yet been completed. The manager shall, in
addition, take such other action as may be appropriate to abate the violation.
   K.   Adjustments To Final Plan During Development:
      1.   Minor Adjustments: During the development of a planned development,
the village manager may authorize minor adjustments to the final plan,
including changes to the site plan or design details, consistent with the
requirements of this section. An adjustment is not minor if it, with regard to
the approvals granted in the final plan:
         (a)   Changes the categories of uses to be permitted or the general
location of residential or non-residential uses;
         (b)   Increases the density of residential uses or the intensity of
non-residential uses;
         (c)   Alters the general architectural style of the planned
development;
         (d)   Alters the location or amount of public and private open space
or recreational amenities;
         (e)   Changes the nature, scope and extent of public dedications,
improvements or contributions to be provided;
         (f)   Increases the height of buildings;
         (g)   Alters the location of any one structure or group of structures,
including fences or screening, from the locations shown on the approved final
plan;
         (h)   Alters the location of any circulation shown on the approved
final plan;
         (i)   Alters any final grade by more than six (6) inches from the
originally planned grade;
         (j)   Increases the footprint of a building or impervious surface;
         (k)   Modifies the proportion of housing types and/or non-residential
uses;
         (l)   Reduces the number of parking spaces;
         (m)   Creates a greater demand or burden on village services or
materially alters the alignment of roads;
         (n)   Increases the amount of stormwater conveyed to the village's
stormwater sewer system;
         (o)   Amends final governing agreements, provisions or covenants, or
provides any other change inconsistent with any standard or condition imposed
on the planned development;
         (p)   Amends any lighting plan approved by the Board of Trustees; or
         (q)   Significantly modifies the landscape plan.
         Minor adjustments shall be consistent with the purpose of this code
and the concept and intent of the final plan for the planned development, as
approved, shall be the minimum necessary to overcome the particular difficulty,
and shall not be approved if they would result in a violation of any standard
or requirement of this code.
         A minor adjustment may be approved by the village manager, after
consultation with the chair of the plan commission and chair of the zoning and
public safety committee, without obtaining separate approval by the board of
trustees. Any request for a minor adjustment may be, in the discretion of the
village manager, or shall be, at the request of the chair of the plan
commission or chair of the zoning and public safety committee, submitted to the
board of trustees for review under subsection 2. below. Any minor adjustment
approved by the village manager shall be reported to the village board.
      2.   Major Adjustments: Any adjustment to the final plan submitted by the
village manager to the board of trustees pursuant to subsection K1 above, or
not otherwise authorized by subsection K1 of this section, shall be considered
to be a major adjustment and shall be granted only upon application to, and
approval by, the board of trustees. The board of trustees may, by ordinance
duly adopted, grant approval for a major adjustment without a hearing upon
finding that any changes in the final plan as approved will be consistent with
the concept and intent of the final plan of the planned development. If the
board of trustees determines that a major adjustment is not consistent with the
concept and intent of the final plan of the planned development as approved,
then the board of trustees shall refer the request to the plan commission for
further hearing and review as provided in subsection D3 of this section.
   L.   Amendments To Final Plan Following Completion Of Development: After
completion of a planned development, an approved final plan may be amended,
varied, or altered in the same manner and subject to the same limitations, as
provided for major adjustments in subsection K of this section.
   M.   Lifestyle Housing:
      1.   General Purposes: The regulations of this subsection M govern
development of very high quality townhouse and condominium dwellings, in one or
more buildings, on property near downtown Hinsdale (generally known as
"lifestyle housing"). The regulations are intended to authorize such housing,
but only to the extent that it reflects the highest standards of design and
construction, consistent with the village's historic and distinctive
residential character and with uses and development adjacent to the proposed
development. Lifestyle housing is intended to be attractive to existing
Hinsdale residents who seek housing that requires less maintenance than single-
family detached houses; residents who wish to remain in the village, close to
neighbors, friends, and familiar institutions, near downtown shopping and
amenities, and close to the transportation center of the village. Lifestyle
housing may be appropriate on property near downtown Hinsdale and on property
of a transitional nature between the downtown retail environment and nearby
single-family residential areas. Lifestyle housing is appropriate in
furtherance of the following public purposes:
         (a)   Local Atmosphere: To maintain the local, "small town" atmosphere
of the areas within which lifestyle housing may be developed.
         (b)   Compatibility: To ensure compatibility of new development with
the existing characteristics of the area.
         (c)   Transitional Areas: To protect sensitive areas of transition
from one land use to another.
         (d)   Attractiveness; Stimulation Of Downtown: To protect and enhance
the village's attractiveness to longtime residents and to visitors, and to
support and stimulate downtown businesses.
         (e)   Strong Economy: To strengthen the economy of the village.
      2.   Location Restrictions: Lifestyle housing shall be permitted only in
the B-1 community business district, the B-3 general business district, the O-
1 specialty office district, and the O-2 limited office district. Further,
lifestyle housing shall be permitted only on property where the purposes set
forth in subsection M1 of this section are advanced. Further, lifestyle housing
shall be permitted on any particular parcel of land only if the proposed
development is, in the determination of the board of trustees, compatible with
adjacent land uses. For example, but only by way of example, a row house style
development may be appropriate on a parcel of land located adjacent to existing
residential uses but a condominium development on that same parcel may not be
appropriate; or, the board of trustees may determine under all of the standards
applicable to special use permits, site plans, exterior appearance plans,
planned developments, and lifestyle housing that no multiple-family use of any
kind is appropriate on that same parcel.
      3.   Applicability Of District Regulations: The regulations of the zoning
district within which the subject property is classified shall apply to and
control development of lifestyle housing except only as specifically provided
otherwise in this section.
      4.   Applicability Of Planned Development Standards: The regulations and
standards of this section shall apply in their entirety to development of
lifestyle housing except only as specifically provided otherwise in this
subsection M.
      5.   Special Exterior Appearance And Design Standards: In addition to all
other applicable exterior appearance standards, the board of trustees shall
consider and evaluate the propriety of approving a planned development for
lifestyle housing guided by the standards and considerations set forth in
subsections 11-605E1(b), E1(c), E2(a), E2(g), E2(h), E2(i), E2(j) and E2(k) of
this article.
      6.   Special Bulk, Yard, And Space Standards: The bulk, yard, and space
standards of the zoning district within which the subject property is
classified shall apply to lifestyle housing except as may be modified pursuant
to this section and except as follows:
                                     33 feet or district maximum, whichever is
Maximum height                       higher, but in no event more than 3
                                     stories
Lot area                             20,000 square feet
Minimum lot area per unit            1,000 square feet
Maximum units per acre               35
Minimum lot width                    60 feet
Minimum lot depth                    125 feet
Maximum lot coverage                 70 percent
Maximum building coverage            70 percent
Maximum floor area ratio             1.5
Minimum number of off street parking 1.5 spaces per unit
spaces
 
      7.   Authorized Uses: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
4-107D of this code or of subsection H3 of this section, the board of trustees
shall have the authority, in connection with the granting of a planned
development approval for lifestyle housing, to authorize on the first floor of
a structure, retail or service uses compatible with similar retail and service
uses in the vicinity of the proposed development. The board of trustees may
limit, specifically or generally, the types of retail or service uses that are
authorized and may place any condition on any such uses as the board of
trustees determines is appropriate. The board of trustees shall not authorize
any use that is not permitted or authorized as a special use in the B-2 central
business district and shall not authorize any such use above the first floor of
any structure.
      8.   Inapplicability Of Certain Standards: Certain of the standards for
planned developments set forth in subsection E of this section are not useful
to the concept of lifestyle housing in the context authorized by this section.
Accordingly, although the principles set forth in said subsection E of this
section may be used to guide the board of trustees, the provisions in
subsections E2(d), "Public Open Space And Contributions", E2(e), "Common Open
Space", and E2(g), "Building And Spacing", of this section shall not be
strictly applicable to a lifestyle housing proposal.
   N.   Expansion Of New Or Used Motor Vehicle Dealerships On Ogden Avenue: The
board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in
this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant a special use permit
authorizing the expansion of new or used motor vehicle dealerships located on
property abutting Ogden Avenue and existing as of May 1, 2003, as a planned
development.
(Ord. 95-14, § 3A, 4-24-1995; Ord. O2002-66, § 4, 10-1-2002; Ord. O2006-75, §
2, 10-17-2006; Ord. O2007-62, § 4, 9-4-2007; Ord. O2019-29, § 3, 9-17-2019;
Ord. O2022-21, § 4, 8-16-2022; Ord. O2025-05, § 10, - -2025)
Sec. 11-604: Site Plan Review:
   A.   Authority: The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant site
plan approval to uses and developments requiring such approval pursuant to
subsection C of this section.
   B.   Purpose: The site plan review process recognizes that even those uses
and developments that have been determined to be generally suitable for
location in a particular district are capable of adversely affecting the
purposes for which this code was enacted unless careful consideration is given
to critical design elements. It is the purpose of this section to provide a
vehicle for the review of the developer’s attention to such elements.
   C.   Site Plan Review Required: Site plan review by the board of trustees in
accordance with this section shall be required in connection with the following
development:
      1.   Any development or redevelopment for which this code requires a
special use permit, including planned development approval.
      2.   Any development or redevelopment for which this code requires
exterior appearance review or a design review permit.
      3.   Any development or redevelopment (other than remodeling that does
not involve the creation of any new floor space or the change of any use) of
any structure, whether new or existing, other than for one single-family
detached dwelling unit involving a parcel under single ownership or control
having an area in excess of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet.
      4.   Any development or redevelopment involving the creation, expansion,
or reconstruction of a parking lot or garage. Resealing, re-striping, paving,
milling, resurfacing, and routine maintenance of an existing parking lot, as
determined by the Community Development Director, is not considered
reconstruction.
      5.   Any development or redevelopment involving a recreational vehicle
storage area, a residential recreational facility, or an antenna or antenna
support structure subject to subsection
9-101D7 or D8 of this code.
      6.   Any nonresidential development on a lot abutting or across a right
of way from any residential district.
      7.   Any development or redevelopment involving a personal wireless
services antenna, with or without an antenna support structure.
   D.   Parties Entitled To Seek Site Plan Approval: Applications for site plan
review may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual
interest in, the subject property.
   E.   Procedure:
      1.   Application: Applications for site plan approval shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article.
      2.   Public Meeting: A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
      3.   Notice Requirements For Nonresidential Site Plan Review: Any site
plan review required for a nonresidential property that is within two hundred
fifty feet (250') from a single-family zoning district shall be subject to the
following notice requirements in addition to those set forth in section
11-303 of this article for the public meeting required by subsection E2 of this
section:
         (a)   By publication in a newspaper published in the village at least
once no less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days in advance
of the public meeting date.
         (b)   By certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal
delivery to the owners of residential properties within two hundred fifty feet
(250') of a nonresidential property that is the subject of an application not
less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days in advance of the
public meeting.
         (c)   By posting a sign on the nonresidential property that is the
subject of an application. Such sign shall be at least six (6) square feet in
area; shall bear on its face the words "Zoning Application Pending" and a
telephone number to be called for additional information; shall be posted on
the nonresidential property, facing the street, at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the date set for a public meeting on the application; and shall be
removed from the nonresidential property following, but not before, the
conclusion of the public meeting.
      4.   Public Meeting Procedure: The chairperson of the plan commission
shall at the public meeting on the application for site plan review allow any
member of the general public to offer relevant, material and nonrepetitive
comment on the application.
      5.   Action By Plan Commission: Within sixty (60) days following the
conclusion of the public meeting, the plan commission shall transmit to the
board of trustees its recommendation, in the form specified in subsection
11-103H of this article, recommending either approval or disapproval of the
site plan based on the standards set forth in subsection F1 of this section. In
the case of any recommendation for disapproval, suggestions as required by
subsection F2 of this section shall be provided. The failure of the plan
commission to act within sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation for approval of the
site plan as submitted.
      6.   Action By Board Of Trustees: Within ninety (90) days following the
receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the board of trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, shall approve
the site plan as submitted, or shall make modifications acceptable to the
applicant and approve such modified site plan, or shall disapprove it in the
manner specified in subsection F of this section either with or without a
remand to the plan commission for further consideration. The failure of the
board of trustees to act within ninety (90) days, or such further time to which
the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying site plan
approval.
   F.   Standards For Site Plan Approval:
      1.   Standards: The board of trustees shall not approve, and the plan
commission shall not recommend approval of, a site plan submitted pursuant to
this section except on the basis of specific written findings establishing that
the applicant has met all of the following standards:
         (a)   The application is complete in specified particulars and does
not contain or reveal violations of this code or other applicable regulations
that the applicant, after written request, has failed or refused to supply or
correct.
         (b)   If the application is submitted in connection with another
application, the approval of which is a condition precedent to the necessity
for site plan review, the applicant has secured approval of that application.
         (c)   The site plan adequately meets specified standards required by
this code with respect to the proposed use or development, including special
use standards where applicable.
         (d)   The proposed site plan does not interfere with easements or
rights of way.
         (e)   The proposed site plan does not unreasonably destroy, damage,
detrimentally modify, or interfere with the enjoyment of significant natural,
topographical, or physical features of the site.
         (f)   The proposed site plan is not unreasonably injurious or
detrimental to the use and enjoyment of surrounding property.
         (g)   The proposed site plan does not create undue traffic congestion
or hazards in the public streets, and the circulation elements of the proposed
site plan do not unreasonably create hazards to safety on or off site or
disjointed, inefficient pedestrian or vehicular circulation paths on or off
site.
         (h)   The screening of the site provides adequate shielding from or
for nearby uses.
         (i)   The proposed structures or landscaping provide reasonable
amenity in relation to, or are compatible with, nearby structures and uses.
         (j)   In the case of site plans submitted in connection with an
application for a special use permit, the proposed site plan makes adequate
provision for the creation or preservation of open space or for its continued
maintenance.
         (k)   The proposed site plan does not create unreasonable drainage or
erosion problems or fail to fully and satisfactorily integrate the site into
the overall existing and planned drainage system serving the village.
         (l)   The proposed site plan does not place unwarranted or
unreasonable burdens on specified utility systems serving the site or area or
fail to fully and satisfactorily integrate the site's utilities into the
overall existing and planned utility systems serving the village.
         (m)   The proposed site plan provides for required public uses
designated on the official map.
         (n)   The proposed site plan does not otherwise adversely affect the
public health, safety, or general welfare.
      2.   Alternative Approaches: In citing a failure to meet any of the
foregoing standards, other than those of subsections F1(a) and F1(b) of this
section, as the basis for recommending disapproval of, or disapproving, a site
plan, the plan commission or the board of trustees shall suggest alternate site
plan approaches that could be developed to avoid the specified deficiency or
shall state the reasons why such deficiency cannot be avoided consistent with
the applicant's objectives.
   G.   Effect Of Site Plan Approval: Approval of a site plan shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the village including, but not limited to, a certificate of
zoning compliance, a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, and
subdivision approval.
   A copy of every approved site plan shall be filed with the village manager
and the development of the site shall be in substantial conformity with such
approved and filed plan.
   H.   Limitations On Site Plan Approval: Subject to an extension of time
granted by the village manager pursuant to subsection
11-101K of this article, no site plan approval shall be valid for a period
longer than one year unless a building permit is issued and construction is
actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion or unless a certificate of occupancy is issued and a use commenced
within that period.
   I.   Adjustments To Site Plan During Development:
      1.   Minor Adjustments: During the development of the site, the village
manager may authorize minor adjustments to a site plan approved by the board of
trustees consistent with the requirements of this section. An adjustment is not
minor if it, with regard to the approvals granted relative to the site plan:
         (a)   Changes the categories of uses to be permitted or the general
location of residential or non-residential uses;
         (b)   Increases the density of residential uses or the intensity of
non-residential uses;
         (c)   Alters the general architectural style of the site;

the concept and intent of the site plan as approved, shall be the minimum
necessary to overcome the particular difficulty, and shall not be approved if
they would result in a violation of any standard or requirement of this code.
      A minor adjustment may be approved by the village manager, after
consultation with the chair of the plan commission and chair of the zoning and
public safety committee, without obtaining separate approval by the board of
trustees. Any request for a minor adjustment may be, in the discretion of the
village manager, or shall be, at the request of the chair of the plan
commission or chair of the zoning and public safety committee, submitted to the
board of trustees for review under subsection 2. below. Any minor adjustment

to and approval by the board of trustees. The board of trustees, by ordinance
duly adopted, may grant approval for a major adjustment without referral to the
plan commission upon finding that any changes in the site plan as approved will
be consistent with the concept and intent of the previously approved site plan.
If the board of trustees determines that a major adjustment is not consistent
with the concept and intent of the site plan as approved, then the board of
trustees shall refer the request to the plan commission for further
consideration and review as provided in subsection E of this section.
   J.   Amendments To Site Plan Following Completion Of Development: After a
site is developed in accordance with an approved site plan, the approved site
plan may be amended, varied, or altered in the same manner and subject to the
same limitations, as provided for original approval of site plans.

Sec. 11-605: Design Review Permit:
   A.   Authority: The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant a
design review permit for any use or development in the design review overlay
district that is permitted in the base district in which such use or
development is located; provided, however, that no such permit shall be granted
unless such use or development complies with the regulations of the base
district in which it is located and all necessary certificates, permits, and
approvals for such use or development shall have been secured.
   B.   Purpose: The design review permit process is intended to provide a
procedure for the review of plans for work in the design review district to
ensure that such work will comply with standards established to preserve the
integrity of areas and structures which have been determined to merit special
protection.
   C.   Parties Entitled To Seek Design Review Permits: An application for a
design review permit may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a
contractual interest in, the subject property.

      1.   Application: Applications for design review permits shall be filed
in accordance with the requirements of section
11-301 of this article.
      2.   Other Approvals Required Prior To Approval: In any case where the
proposed work requires the issuance of a special use permit, variation, or
other approval, no design review permit shall be granted unless and until such
special use permit, variation, or other approval has been issued. The issuance
of any such other approval shall not be deemed to establish any right to the
issuance of a design review permit.
      3.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
      4.   Action By Plan Commission: Within thirty five (35) days following

the plan commission shall, in writing, recommend to the board of trustees to
grant the design review permit without modification, grant the design review
permit with modifications or subject to conditions, or deny the design review
permit. In reaching its recommendation, the plan commission shall be guided by
the purposes for which the design review district is designated and by the
particular standards and considerations set forth in subsection E of this
section. The failure of the plan commission to act within thirty five (35)
days, or such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall
be deemed a recommendation to deny the design review permit.
      5.   Action By Board Of Trustees: Within thirty five (35) days after
receiving the recommendation of the plan commission pursuant to subsection D4
of this section or, if the plan commission fails to act within thirty five (35)
days following the conclusion of the public hearing provided in subsection D3
of this section, within seventy (70) days following the conclusion of such
public hearing, the board of trustees shall, by ordinance duly adopted, grant
the design review permit without modification, grant the design review permit
with modifications or subject to conditions, or deny the design review permit.
The failure of the board of trustees to act within the time limits set in this
subsection, or such longer time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be
deemed a denial of the design review permit. In reaching its decision, the
board of trustees shall be guided by the purposes for which the design review
district is designated and by the particular standards and considerations set
forth in subsection E of this section.
      6.   Issuance Of Certificate: If a design review permit is granted
pursuant to this section, the village manager, within seven (7) days following
the passage of the ordinance by the board of trustees pursuant to subsection D5
of this section, shall issue the design review permit, noting thereon any
modifications or conditions imposed by the board of trustees. Each design
review permit shall state on its face, in bold type, that:

of entrances and other projections to sidewalks shall be visually compatible
with the buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually related.

buildings, the plan commission and the board of trustees shall consider the
availability of materials, technology, and craftsmanship to duplicate existing
styles, patterns, textures, and overall detailing.
      4.   Manuals And Guidelines: The plan commission may from time to time
provide for specific manuals or guidelines for architectural styles or common

modifications in such plans be made, or on any other condition deemed necessary
to achieving the purposes and objectives of this section. Such conditions and
modifications shall be set forth in the resolution granting approval and in the
design review permit. The violation of any such condition or modification shall
be a violation of this code.
   G.   Affidavit Of Compliance With Conditions: Whenever a design review
permit issued pursuant to this section is made subject to conditions to be met
by the applicant, the applicant, upon meeting such conditions, shall file an
affidavit with the village manager stating such compliance.
   H.   Limitation On Permits: A design review permit shall become null and
void six (6) months after the date on which it was issued unless within such
period the work authorized by such permit is commenced. A design review permit
shall relate solely to the work shown on plans approved by the issuance of such
permit and it shall be unlawful for any person to deviate from such plans
without obtaining an amended permit in the same manner as herein provided for
obtaining original permits. (1991 Code)

trustees its recommendation, in the form specified in subsection
11-103H of this article, recommending either granting the building permit
application, granting the application subject to conditions, or denying the
application. The failure of the plan commission to act within sixty (60) days,
or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
recommendation for approval of the application.

receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the board of trustees shall approve the building permit

Sec. 11-607: Sign Permit:
   A.   Authority: The village manager and plan commission may, in accordance

may approve such application without a vote by the full plan commission;
provided, however, that such review and approval, if granted, shall occur
within fifteen (15) days of the submission of a complete application. Completed

      3.   Action By Plan Commission: Within sixty (60) days following the
referral of a completed application to the plan commission, the plan commission
shall either grant the sign permit or, by written resolution stating the
reasons therefor, deny the application or grant the application with
modifications or conditions. The failure of the plan commission to act within
sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall
be deemed to be a decision granting the sign permit.

this section unless the applicant shall establish that:
      1.   Visual Compatibility: The proposed sign will be visually compatible
with the building on which the sign is proposed to be located and surrounding
buildings and structures in terms of height, size, proportion, scale,
materials, texture, colors, and shapes.
      2.   Quality Of Design And Construction: The proposed sign will be
constructed and maintained with a design and materials of high quality and good
relationship with the design and character of the neighborhood.
      3.   Appropriateness To Activity: The proposed sign is appropriate to and
necessary for the activity to which it pertains.
      4.   Appropriateness To Site: The proposed sign will be appropriate to
its location in terms of design, landscaping, and orientation on the site, and
will not create a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, detract from the
value or enjoyment of neighboring properties, or unduly increase the number of
signs in the area.
   F.   Authority To Modify Certain Sign Regulations:
      1.   Authority: Subject to the standards and limitations set forth in
this subsection F, the plan commission shall have the authority, in connection
with the granting of a sign permit pursuant to this section, to modify the
provisions of section
9-106 of this code in those specific instances enumerated in subsection F2 of
this section and in accordance with each of the standards enumerated in
subsection F3 of this section.

twenty percent (20%), the minimum or maximum allowable height from grade of any
sign.
         (b)   To increase by not more than five percent (5%) the maximum area
of signage otherwise allowed.
         (c)   To increase by not more than one sign the maximum number of
signs of any functional type otherwise allowed.

on a lot where signs of such functional types are not otherwise allowed:
business sign, identification sign, joint identification sign, off premises
identification sign, and public service sign.
         (e)   To adjust the required spacing between any signs or structures.
      3.   Standards For Modifications: No modification shall be granted
pursuant to this subsection F unless the applicant properly applies for the
specific relief required and the applicant establishes compliance with all of
the following standards:
         (a)   General Standard: Carrying out the strict letter of the
provisions of section
9-106 of this code would create a particular hardship or a practical difficulty
not caused by an act or omission of the applicant.
         (b)   Unusual Physical Limitations: The subject property or the
structure on which the sign is proposed to be located is burdened with an
unusual physical limitation, such as an irregular shape, unusual geographic
location, exceptional topographical feature, or other extraordinary physical
condition, that is peculiar to the subject property and that is more than
merely an inconvenience or cost consideration to the applicant.
         (c)   Adverse Impacts: The modification, if granted, would have no
adverse impact on any abutting or adjacent property and no adverse impact on
the essential character of any part of or all of the neighborhood of the
subject property.
         (d)   Public Health And Safety: The modification, if granted, would
have no adverse impact on, and would not endanger, the public health or safety.

chairperson or the plan commission, as applicable, may impose such conditions
and limitations concerning the construction and maintenance of a sign upon the
grant of a sign permit as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure
satisfaction of the standards set forth in this section and the purposes and
objectives of this code and to minimize any adverse effects upon other property
in the vicinity. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the permit
issued by the village manager or the written resolution granting the sign
permit by the plan commission. Violation of any such condition or limitation
shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation
of the sign permit.
   H.   Effect Of Issuance Of A Sign Permit: The granting of a sign permit by
the village manager and the plan commission chairperson or the plan commission,
as appropriate, shall not authorize construction or maintenance of any sign,
but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of
applications for any other permits or approvals that may be required by the
codes and ordinances of the village, including, but not limited to, a building
permit. (Ord. O2011-10, 2-15-2011)
