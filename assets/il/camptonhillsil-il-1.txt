Village Code of Campton Hills shall be amended by the addition of Chapter 6

the following meanings:
 
A.   "Amount paid" means the amount charged to the taxpayer's service address
in this municipality regardless of where such amount is billed or paid.
B.   "Department" means the Illinois Department of Revenue.
C.   "Gross charge" means the amount paid for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this municipality and for all
services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued
in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services
and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any
deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the
materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case
credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid.
Gross charges for private line service shall include charges imposed at each
channel termination point within this municipality and charges for the portion
of the inter-office channels provided within this municipality. Charges for
that portion of the inter-office channel connecting two or more channel
termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional
boundary of this municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by
multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-office channel by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points
that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the municipality and the
denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points
connected by the inter-office channel. However, gross charge shall not include
any of the following:
1.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant
to: (i) the tax imposed by this Ordinance; (ii) the tax imposed by the
Telecommunications Excise Tax Act; (iii) the tax imposed by Section 4251 of the
Internal Revenue Code; (iv) 9-1-1 surcharges; or, (v) charges added to
customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of Section 9-221 or 9-222 of the
Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers'

other amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act.

municipality.
3.   Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or
information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information

limited to, the use of calculators, computers, data processing equipment,
tabulating equipment or accounting equipment and also includes the usage of
computers under a time-sharing agreement.
4.   Charges for customer equipment, including such equipment that is leased or
rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are disaggregated
and separately identified from other charges.
5.   Charges to business enterprises certified as exempt under Section 9-222.1
of the Public Utilities Act to the extent of such exemption and during the
period of time specified by the Department of Commerce and Economic
Opportunity.
6.   Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in
connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under
this Ordinance has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that
the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service.
7.   "Bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail
for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has
become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal
income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is

during the reporting period in which the payment is made.
8.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication
devices.
9.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications
Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.
10. Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: (i) those charges
are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are taxable; (ii)
those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or invoice; and,
(iii) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on the
retailer’s books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services of telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
D.   "Interstate telecommunications" means all telecommunications that either
originate or terminate outside this state.
E.   “Intrastate telecommunications" means all telecommunications that
originate and terminate within this state.

H.   "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the business of

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes adequate security to
insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion.
I.   "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state", or any like
term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,

retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or
agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or
whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.
J.   "Sale at retail" means the transmitting, supplying or furnishing of
telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection
therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state
governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a
parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
K.   "Service address" means the location of telecommunications equipment from
which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems and maritime systems,
service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the
Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems
and the like, service address shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary
use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
L.   "Taxpayer" means a person who individually or through his or her agents,
employees or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or
receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability
as authorized by the Ordinance.
M.   "Telecommunications," in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll and wide area telephone service, private
line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer
exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized
mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service or any other form of
mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other
transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between
or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite or similar facilities. As used in this Ordinance, "private line"
means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that
entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel
or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of telecommunications shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. Telecommunications shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered telecommunications
subject to the tax imposed under this Ordinance. For purposes of this Section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section
2-27 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act.

tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax properly due and paid
in another municipality in this state which was not previously allowed as a
credit against any other state or local tax in this state.
   C. The tax imposed by this Ordinance is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.
3-6-3:   COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this Ordinance shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this Ordinance and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Ordinance
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this Ordinance shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
3-6-4:   RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
   On or before the last day of February, and on or before the last day of
every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this Ordinance on
telecommunications retailers for the preceding calendar month shall be returned
with appropriate forms and information as required by the Department pursuant
to the Illinois Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (35 ILCS 636/5-
50) and any accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to
implement the Act.
3-6-5:   RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.    Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.
Section 3. Use of Tax Revenue. All revenue generated by the Village under this
municipal telecommunications tax shall be maintained in a separate and distinct
fund of the Village that shall be used only for the repair and maintenance of
the Village’s municipal street system, in conjunction with any other funds
received from the State of Illinois or any other entity to perform these
functions. The Village may adopt any such further ordinance or policy to
control the maintenance and use of these funds.
 
Section 4. Repeal of Conflicting Provisions. All ordinances, resolutions, and
policies or parts thereof, in conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance
are, to the extent of the conflict, expressly repealed on the effective date of
this Ordinance.
 
Section 5. Severability. If any provision of this Ordinance or application
thereof to any person or circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of
this Ordinance that can be given effect without the invalid application or
provision, and each invalid provision or invalid application of this Ordinance
is severable.
 
Section 6. The clerk is directed by the Corporate Authorities to publish this
Ordinance in pamphlet form. This Ordinance shall be in full force and effect
after its passage and publication in accordance with 65 ILCS 5/1-2-4, provided,
however, that the tax provided for herein shall take effect for all bills
issued on or after the first day of January, 2026. Copies of this Ordinance
shall be certified and sent to the Illinois Department of Revenue prior to
September 20, 2025.

to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and, if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the

related to deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible, and provided further, that if such charges are thereafter
collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax.
Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by

(E)   Such other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.

elects, report and pay an amount based upon total billing of business subject

amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon
any differences between such billing, and the taxable gross receipts.
3-8-8:   Resales.
(A)   Electricity that is delivered to a person in this Village shall be
considered to be for use and consumption by that person unless the person
receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the Village and
furnishes that number to the person who delivers the electricity, and certifies
to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially nontaxable as a
sale for resale.

the tax imposed by this Chapter on any purchases of electricity and shall
furnish such additional information as the Village may reasonably require.
(C)   Upon approval of the application, the Village shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant.
(D)   The Village may cancel the resale number of any person if the person

discontinued making resales.
(E)   
(1)   If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and
partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this Chapter
directly to the Village pursuant to Section 7 herein on the amount of
electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect
the tax pursuant to Section 6 herein and remit the tax pursuant to Section
7 herein on the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser.
(2)   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active resale
number and complying with all other conditions of this section shall be excused
from collecting and remitting the tax on an portion of the electricity
delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the village the
total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and such other
information that the village may reasonably require.
3-8-9:   Books and Records.
Every tax collector, and every taxpayer required to pay the tax imposed by this
Chapter shall keep accurate books and records of its business or activity,
including contemporaneous books and records denoting the transactions that gave
rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability under this Chapter. The
books and records shall be subject to and available for inspection at all times
during business hours of the day.
3-8-10: Credit for Overpayment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, in order to permit sound
fiscal planning and budgeting by the Village, no person shall be entitled to a
refund of, or credit for, a tax imposed under this Chapter unless the person

the tax was paid or remitted.

the amount of tax due together with reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs
incurred by the Village in enforcing this Ordinance.
3-8-12: Severability.
If any provision of this Ordinance, or the application of any provision of this
Ordinance, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such holding shall
not affect any other provision of this Ordinance, or its application, that can
be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this Ordinance.
 
Section 3.   Use of Tax Revenue. All revenue generated by the Village under
this electric utility tax shall be maintained in a separate and distinct fund
of the Village that shall be used only for the repair and maintenance of the
Village’s municipal street system, in conjunction with any other funds received
from the State of Illinois or any other entity to perform these functions. The
Village may adopt any such further ordinance or policy to control the
maintenance and use of these funds.
Section 4.    Repeal of Conflicting Provisions. All ordinances and resolutions,
or parts thereof, in conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance are, to the
extent of the conflict, expressly repealed on the effective date of this
Ordinance.
 
Section 5.    Severability. If any provision of this Ordinance or application
thereof to any person or circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of
this Ordinance that can be given effect without the invalid application or
provision, and each invalid provision or invalid application of this Ordinance
is severable.
 
Section 6.   Effective Date. The clerk is directed by the corporate authorities
to publish this Ordinance in pamphlet form. This Ordinance shall be in full
force and effect upon its passage, approval, and publication in pamphlet form

said violation claim; and

complaint.
   B.   Payment In Lieu Of Fine Authorized:
      1.   Pursuant to a citation issued as set forth in this section, the
person so accused of said violation may settle and compromise the violation

set forth in subsection D of this section within a period to be specified in
said citation but not more than fourteen (14) days from the time said alleged
offense was committed.

   C.   Procedure Upon Nonpayment: In the event that the person to whom a
citation is issued pursuant to this section fails to settle and pay said

the time of the hearing, the violation has been remedied or removed;

1-4A-8: FINDINGS, DECISION AND ORDER:
   A.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make a

not a code violation exists. The determination shall be in writing and shall be
designated as findings, decision, and order. The findings, decision, and order

to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the village as a
result of a finding of a code violation under this article shall attach to the

violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or transferring the

the owner of record of a building has been notified in writing that such owner

served upon such owner of record or sent by registered mail to the last known
address of such owner. (2013 Code § 8-1-13)
1-4A-11: JUDICIAL REVIEW:

administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code
violation, the village may commence a proceeding in the circuit court of the
16th judicial circuit, Kane County, Illinois, for the purpose of obtaining a
judgment on the findings, decision and order. Nothing in this section shall
prevent the village from the consolidation of multiple findings, decision and
order against a person in such a proceeding.

decision and order, the village shall file a certified copy of the findings,
decision and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites

proceeding does not exceed that set out in section
1-4-1 of this chapter. (2013 Code § 8-1-15; amd. 2016 Code)

under this section and for judicial review as provided in this article:
      1.   The court shall render judgment in favor of the village and against
the defendant for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and order,
plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the
same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
      2.   The court may also issue any other orders and injunctions that are
requested by the village to enforce the order of the hearing officer to correct
a code violation. (2013 Code § 8-1-15)

in evidence introduced at the hearing; and
      8.   Issue a final determination on applications for PSEBA benefits based
on the evidence presented at the hearing, the determination of which shall be
in writing and shall include a written finding of fact, decision and order.
   B.   Hearings: Hearings for the determination of eligibility for benefits
under PSEBA shall be initiated by the Village after the submission of a full
and complete PSEBA application, and a determination by the hearing officer that
it is appropriate to proceed with the hearing, which determination shall
include consideration of the status of any disability pension proceeding
related to the applicant and whether the disability pension proceeding has
resulted in a final and non-appealable decision. A hearing shall be held to
adjudicate and determine whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under
the PSEBA. If the applicant is found eligible, the PSEBA benefits provided to
the applicant shall be consistent with the PSEBA.
      1.   Record: Hearings shall be attended by a certified court reporter,
and a transcript of all proceedings shall be made by said certified court
reporter.
      2.   Procedures: The Village and the applicant shall be entitled to
representation by counsel at hearings and may present witnesses, testimony and
documents, may cross-examine opposing witnesses, and may request the issuance

witnesses or the production of relevant documents. The hearing officer may
issue subpoenas to compel the appearance of relevant witnesses or the
production of relevant documents in his/her discretion.
      3.   Evidence: The Illinois Rules of Evidence shall apply to the extent
practicable unless, by such application, the hearing officer determines that

evidence of the type commonly relied upon by a reasonably prudent person in the
conduct of her/his affairs. Such determination shall be in the sole discretion
of the hearing officer.

have the obligation and burden of proof to establish that the applicant is
eligible and qualified to receive PSEBA benefits. The standard of proof in all
hearings shall be by the preponderance of the evidence. (Ord. O-24-03, 2-6-

1-12-4: PSEBA BENEFITS GRANTED BY THE VILLAGE:
   A.   Group Insurance Plan: If an applicant is determined to be eligible for
PSEBA benefits, the applicant will be eligible to receive continued health
coverage consistent with the PSEBA under the applicant's choice of the
Village's group health insurance plan offerings. The Village's group health
insurance plan may change from time to time in the Village's sole discretion.
PSEBA beneficiaries may only change from one health insurance plan to another
during the Village's open enrollment period. PSEBA benefits do not include
benefits not provided in the Village's group health insurance plan, such as,
but not limited to, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.
   B.   Reduction Or Elimination Of PSEBA Benefits By Other Health Coverage: If
an applicant or PSEBA beneficiary becomes eligible to receive health insurance
benefits from any other source, including, but not limited to, Medicare, the
PSEBA beneficiary's PSEBA coverage may be reduced or eliminated as determined
by the Village consistent with PSEBA. If there is another source, the applicant
or PSEBA beneficiary shall notify the Village of that source no later than five
(5) business days from that source becoming available to the applicant, the
applicant's beneficiaries or the PSEBA beneficiary. Applicants and PSEBA
beneficiaries have an ongoing obligation to, and shall, update the Village with
their health insurance coverage information available from any other source,
and failure to do so may result in the denial of benefits and/or reimbursement
to the Village for duplicate coverage. If duplicate coverage has been received
by a PSEBA beneficiary, further PSEBA benefits will be denied until the Village
has been fully reimbursed by the PSEBA beneficiary for what it would have been
credited if it had known about other coverage. Receipt of health insurance
benefits from other sources without notice to the Village shall require the
PSEBA beneficiary to reimburse the Village for the value of those benefits.
   C.   Affidavit Of Continued PSEBA Eligibility: All recipients of PSEBA
benefits from the Village shall complete and return to the Village
Administrator on an annual basis an affidavit verifying the recipient's
continued eligibility for PSEBA benefits. The affidavit must be completed and
returned to the Village Administrator within sixty (60) calendar days of
written notice from the Village. If the recipient does not complete and return
the affidavit within the time required, the Village Administrator shall give
the recipient an additional written notice providing an additional thirty (30)
calendar days for the recipient to complete and return the affidavit. Failure
to return the affidavit within the time required shall result in the recipient
incurring responsibility for reimbursing the Village for premiums paid during
the period the affidavit is due and not filed. (Ord. O-24-03, 2-6-2024)

revoke or suspend any video gaming license issued by the Village if the Village
President determines the licensed establishment has violated any of the
provisions of this chapter, any provision of other Village ordinances, or any
applicable state or federal law or regulation. No video gaming license shall be
revoked or suspended, however, until a public hearing has been conducted by the
Village President, with a three (3)-day written notice to the licensed
establishment to the licensee or the licensee's manager of the licensed
premises. No hearing will be required, however, to revoke or suspend a village
video gaming license for an establishment that has its state video gaming

commercial vehicle shall be deemed to be emitting excessive noise if the
vehicle is operating an engine braking system, and if the vehicle is not

7-8-2B of this chapter, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the

the owner or lessee of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control
of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, and who is physically
present at the scene, that the vehicle will be seized and impounded, and that
the owner or lessee has the right to request a preliminary vehicle impoundment
hearing and participate in an administrative hearing. If the owner or lessee is
present at the scene, the police officer shall inform the owner or lessee that
he/she has a right to make a written request for a preliminary vehicle
impoundment hearing within forty-eight hours of the seizure in accordance with
the provisions of section
7-8-4 of this chapter. If the owner or lessee of the vehicle is not present at
the scene, the Village shall send the owner or lessee written notice of the
seizure and impoundment by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the
address listed on the owner or lessee’s vehicle registration within twenty-four
hours of impoundment, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or Village holidays. Said
notice shall inform the owner or lessee that he/she has the right to request a
preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing within forty-eight hours of the owner
or lessee’s receipt of the notice in accordance with section
7-8-4 of this chapter. The Village shall also provide notice that said motor
vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for
in this chapter, unless the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle or a
lienholder of record posts with the Village a cash bond as set forth in section
7-8-5 of this chapter.
   B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, the
arresting police officer may release the vehicle prior to towing if the vehicle
subject to seizure and impoundment was not owned by the person placed under
arrest and the registered owner or person legally authorized to possess the
vehicle shall arrive at the scene of the arrest prior to the actual removal or
towing of the vehicle and the lawful owner or person lawfully entitled to
possession of the vehicle possesses a valid operator’s license, proof of
ownership or registration, proof of liability insurance and would not, as
determined by the arresting police officer, indicate a lack of ability to
operate the motor vehicle in a safe manner, or who would otherwise, by
operating the motor vehicle, be in violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
   C.   Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the
preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing provided for in section
7-8-4 of this chapter, unless the owner or lessee of the vehicle or a
lienholder posts with the Village a cash bond, or pays by money order or
certified check to the Village of Campton Hills the amount of the specific
administrative fee noted in subsection
7-8-2E above, plus any accrued towing and storage charges. (Ord. O-24-14, 7-16-
2024)
7-8-4: PRELIMINARY HEARING:
If the owner of record or lessee of a vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to
this chapter desires to appeal the seizure, said owner or lessee must make a
request for a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing within forty eight hours
of the seizure, or within forty eight hours of receipt of notice by the owner
or lessee of the seizure if the owner or lessee was not present at the time of
the seizure. Said request shall be in writing and filed with the Chief of
Police or his designee who shall conduct such preliminary hearing within forty-
eight hours after receipt of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or
Village holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing. The
formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably
prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the
Chief of Police or his designee determines by a preponderance of the evidence
that the vehicle was properly subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to
this chapter, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as
provided in this section, unless the owner or lessee of the vehicle or a
lienholder posts with the Village a cash bond, or pays by money order,
certified check, or approved credit card service the amount of the specific
administrative fee noted in subsection
7-8-2E above, plus any applicable towing and storage fees. If the Chief of
Police or his designee determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the
vehicle was improperly seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the
vehicle will be returned without penalty or other fees. (Ord. O-24-14, 7-16-
2024)
7-8-5: FINAL ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING:
   A.   Unless the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle prevails at a
preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing held pursuant to section
7-8-4 of this chapter, or the owner or lessee affirmatively waives his/her
right to a final administrative hearing, within ten business days after a motor
vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the Village shall
notify the owner of record, or lessee and any lienholders of record by personal
service or first class mail, of the date, time and location of a hearing that
will be conducted pursuant to this section. The notice shall state the fees
that may be imposed, and that a motor vehicle not released by cash bond or
other form of payment acceptable to the Village may be sold or disposed of by
the Village in accordance with applicable law.
   B.   The final administrative hearing shall be conducted and held, unless
the owner or lessee prevailed at a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing,
affirmatively waives the hearing, or the hearing is continued by order of the
Hearing Officer, no later than forty-five days after the motor vehicle was
seized. The hearing shall be conducted and the case decided by a Hearing
Officer appointed by the Village. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the
hearing date, the Hearing Officer may, at the request of either party, direct
witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of
evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible
if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the
conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines
by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle, operated with the
permission, express or implied of the owner or lessee, was properly subject to
seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall
enter an order finding the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle
civilly liable to the Village for an administrative fee in an amount as
specifically noted in subsection
7-8-2E above, and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the
administrative fee is paid to the Village, plus any applicable towing and
storage fees. If the owner of record or lessee fails to appear at the hearing,
the Hearing Officer shall enter a default order in favor of the Village, a copy
of which shall be sent to the registered owner or lessee via certified mail,
return receipt requested. If a cash bond or other acceptable form of payment
has been posted, that amount shall be applied to the amount owed. If the
Hearing Officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was
improperly seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the Hearing Officer
shall order the immediate return of the owner or lessee’s vehicle or cash bond
without fees. All orders issued by the Hearing Officer shall be in writing.
   C.   If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to section
7-8-2E of this chapter, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
Village. If a cash bond or other form of monetary payment acceptable to the
Village has been posted pursuant to this chapter, such amount shall be applied
to the administrative fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when such an
administrative fee is imposed, the Village may seek to obtain a judgment on the
debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except
as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded
until the administrative fee is paid to the Village and any applicable towing
and storage fees are paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle
shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or
the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a
lien as provided by law. If the administrative fee and other applicable fees
are not paid within thirty-five days after an administrative fee is imposed
against an owner of record or lessee who defaults by failing to appear at the
hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the
manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other
cases, if the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within
thirty five days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of
the Hearing Officer’s determination may be sought, or within thirty days after
an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the
Village, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. Unless stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under
this chapter which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of
the deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Act
may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law or if the Hearing
Officer found by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was
improperly seized and impounded, no owner, lienholder, or other person shall be
legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this chapter
until the administrative fee and other applicable fees under this chapter have
been paid in full. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an
impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the
vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund
to the Village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any
amounts required to pay all lienholders of record, not to exceed the
administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees.
   E.   If the Hearing Officer finds that the Village exceeded its authority
under this chapter in the seizure and impoundment of a motor vehicle, the
Village shall be liable to the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle
for the cost of storage fees and reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. O-24-14, 7-16-
2024)
7-8-6: APPEAL:
Any party may appeal a final decision of the Hearing Officer pursuant to the
provision of the Illinois Administrative Review Act. (Ord. O-24-14, 7-16-2024)

that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Village
Engineer shall specify the portion of the right- of-way upon which the facility
may be placed, used and constructed.
         b.   In the event that the Village Engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: 1)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction; or
2) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
         c.   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work by this chapter, the telecommunications retailer
shall submit to the Village an application for a permit and any and all plans,
specifications and documentation available regarding the facility to be
constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of
subsection D2 of this section.
   E.   Effect Of Permit:
      1.   A permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only

and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public
rights-of-way.
      2.   The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the
permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and all
applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
      3.   Collocation of small wireless facilities must be completed within
one hundred eighty (180) days after the issuance of the permit. If collocation
is not complete, the permit will be void. Permits for small wireless facilities
are valid for five (5) years from the time of issuance.

facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the
plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the
permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with this chapter. If the
Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
   G.   Suspension Or Revocation Of Permit:

operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as X, C, and U coverages) and products- completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            (1)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or
death to each person;
            (2)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
            (3)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
         b.   Property insurance for replacement costs against all risks; and
         c.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits.
      2.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this
subsection may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies.
Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying
insurance on a following form basis such that when any loss covered by the
primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or
umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.
      3.   Copies Required: The wireless provider or utility shall provide
copies of any of the policies required by this subsection to the Village within
ten (10) days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
      4.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages:
         a.   The insurance policies required by this subsection shall contain
the following endorsement:
            It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such
intent to cancel or not to renew.
         b.   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice,
and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the
wireless provider or utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence
of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this subsection.
      5.   Self-Insurance: A wireless provider or utility may self-insure all
or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by
subsection A1 of this section. A wireless provider or utility that self-insures
is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the
requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection A1 of this
section, or the requirements of subsections A2, A3 and A4 of this section. A
wireless provider or utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection A1 of
this section, such as evidence that the wireless provider or utility is a
"private self-insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
      6.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Wireless Provider's Or
Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the wireless provider or utility to
the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this subsection shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder.
   B.   Indemnification: By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-
of-way, a wireless provider or utility shall be deemed to agree to defend,
indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials and
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any
and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses,
including reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out
of, resulting from, or alleged to arise out of or result from, the negligent,
careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the
wireless provider or utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of
the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however,
that the wireless provider's or utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall
not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or
expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach
of this chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
   C.   Security:
      1.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this subsection C. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this subsection C at the permittee's
sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
         a.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
         b.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued
pursuant to this chapter; and
         c.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
      2.   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village
in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection C2 shall, at a minimum:
         a.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
         b.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection
by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
         c.   Provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
      3.   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient
to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Engineer
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this subsection C3 for any single phase.
      4.   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection C4, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund;
provided, that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
         a.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         b.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due
and unpaid;
         c.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
         d.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the
Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.
      5.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection C3 of this section.
      6.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the
Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village; provided,
that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum
balance required in subsection C3 of this section.
      7.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation;
provided, that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
      8.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect
to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village,
whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. O-18-11, 7-
17-2018)
8-1-6: UTILITY CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP, IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS:
   A.   Notification Of Change: A utility shall notify the Village no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   B.   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village right-of-
way.
   C.   Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. O-18-11,
7-17-2018)
8-1-7: GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
   A.   Standards And Principles: All construction in the right-of- way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in the following IDOT publications:
      1.   "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction";
      2.   "Supplemental Specifications and Recurring Special Provisions";
      3.   "Highway Design Manual";
      4.   "Highway Standards Manual";
      5.   "Standard Specifications for Traffic Control Items";
      6.   "Illinois Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices" (92 Ill. Adm.
Code section 545);
      7.   "Flagger's Handbook"; and
      8.   "Work Site Protection Manual for Daylight Maintenance Operations".
   B.   Interpretation Of Standards And Principles: If a discrepancy exists
between or among differing principles and standards required by this chapter,
the Village Engineer shall determine, in the exercise of sound engineering
judgment, which principles apply, and such decision shall be final. If
requested, the Village Engineer shall state which standard or principle will
apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the
future. (Ord. O-18-11, 7-17-2018)
8-1-8: PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONTROL:
The placement of any antenna, wireless facility or small wireless facilities
located in the Village right-of-way may not interfere with the frequencies used
by public safety agencies for public safety communications. Unacceptable
interference will be determined in accordance with industry standards and the
Federal Communications Commission's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum. If an antenna, wireless facility or
small wireless facility causes such interference, the owner must take all steps
necessary to correct and eliminate the interference at its own costs. The
Village may terminate a permit for any antenna, wireless facility or small
wireless facility based on such interference if the interference is not
corrected.
The Village may reserve space on its utility pole for future public safety
uses. This reservation of space may preclude the collocation of a small
wireless facility where the Village determines that the utility pole cannot
accommodate both uses.
   A.   Minimum Requirements: The Village minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT's "Illinois Manual On Uniform Traffic Control
Devices" and this Code.
   B.   Warning Signs, Protective Devices And Flaggers: The wireless provider
or utility is responsible for providing and installing warning signs,
protective devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting all applicable
Federal, State, and local requirements for protection of the public and the
utility workers when performing any work on the public rights- of-way.
   C.   Interference With Traffic: All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   D.   Notice When Access Is Blocked: At least forty eight (48) hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence,
business or institution, the wireless provider or utility shall notify the
resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and
duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency
repairs pursuant to this chapter, the wireless provider or utility shall
provide such notice as is practicable under the circumstances.
   E.   Compliance: The wireless provider or utility shall take immediate
action to correct any deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are
brought to the wireless provider's or utility's attention by the Village. (Ord.
O-18-11, 7-17-2018)
8-1-9: LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
   A.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways:
      1.   Overhead Parallel Facilities: An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of- way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         b.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (2') (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         c.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (4') (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         d.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         e.   Any ground mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (1')
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way
line.
      2.   Underground Parallel Facilities: An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (8') (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         b.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in an existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line, and any
aboveground appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
   B.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.
      4.   Overhead Power Or Communication Facility: An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ILCC
rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         b.   Poles are located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right-of-
way line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         c.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      5.   Underground Power Or Communication Facility: An underground power or
communications facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance free service life; and
         b.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
(1989)).
   C.   Location Within Particular Rights-Of-Way: The Village may require that
utilities be located within particular rights-of- way that are not highways,
rather than within particular highways.
   D.   Freestanding Facilities:
      1.   Small Wireless Facilities:
         a.   The Village may not require the placement of a small wireless
facility on a specific utility pole or category of poles. However, should the
application necessitate the instillation of a new utility pole, the Village may
propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility
pole or existing support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the
proposed collocation. Should the applicant reject the proposed relocated
collocation, it must provide a written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternative location will
not satisfy the wireless provider's needs. The Village may require any
monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-
of-way to be screened from view in compliance with the appearance standards
described in subsection E of this section.
         b.   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right- of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
aboveground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the aboveground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
      2.   Other Facilities:
         a.   The Village may restrict the location and size of any monopole,
utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way. No
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way may be constructed or
modified so that the height of the freestanding facility is higher by more than
ten feet (10') or more than ten percent (10%), whichever is greater, than any
other existing, freestanding facility located within the right-of-way within
three hundred feet (300') of the proposed facility, measured along the center
line of the respective right-of-way. Where there are no other freestanding
facilities located within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed facility,
the maximum height of the freestanding facility shall be forty five feet (45').
         b.   The Village may require any monopole, utility pole or other
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view.
         c.   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right- of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
aboveground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the aboveground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
   E.   Design And Appearance Standards:
      1.   Visual Quality: The Village may discourage the installation of
facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   Restrictions: A facility may be constructed only if its construction
does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features
visible to the highway user or conflicts with the applicable design standards
set forth below.
      3.   Design Standards:
         a.   Residential Design Standards:
            (1)   Applicability: These design standards shall apply to each
facility located in the right-of-way in a district zoned for residential uses.
            (2)   Purpose: Ensure visually acceptable facility design and to
provide discretion on required and preferred design of small wireless
facilities.
               (A)   Applicants must use architectural treatments and stealth
techniques to reduce potential visual impacts from all small wireless
facilities.
               (B)   All new utility poles installed for the purpose of
mounting a facility must be stealth or camouflaged to blend into the
surrounding environment. Examples of stealth or camouflage designs are
presented in figure 1 of this section.
               (C)   Small wireless facilities and all ancillary equipment
associated with the facility must not emit sound.
               (D)   Cables must be routed directly from the ground through the
pole and equipment enclosures must completely enclose or hide cabling. No
exposed cable is allowed.
               (E)   No flashing lights or unnecessary, non- essential stickers
are allowed to be placed on any facility. Stickers must be designed in the same
color as the pole to which they are attached.
               (F)   In no case shall equipment block the sidewalk or
pedestrian pathway. All installations must maintain accessibility requirements
and standards.
               (G)   All newly installed equipment must be painted with
graffiti-resistant paint to match pole color and surroundings.
               (H)   Colors and materials for small wireless facilities shall
be chosen to minimize the visibility of the facility.
               (I)   Antennas attached to existing poles or Municipally-owned
infrastructure shall be painted and textured to match the existing structure.
               (J)   Any ground-mounted facility shall be painted with non-
reflective matte finish paint using color shades that are comparable or blend
with surrounding natural elements such as soil, trees, or grasslands. Any
ground-mounted facility shall be screened from the yard of the property in
front of which it is located using year-round landscaping materials. The owner
of the ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the landscaping materials for a
period of one year from planting.
               (K)   All disturbed pavement and landscaping shall be replaced
and areas of bare or disturbed soils must be re-vegetated. If replacement
landscape is determined to be infeasible the Village may accept mitigation
funds to use elsewhere. The owner of the ground-mounted facility shall
guarantee the restoration work or reseeding for a period of one year.
               (L)   No facility may display any signage or advertisements
unless expressly allowed by the Village in a written approval, recommended
under FCC regulations or required by law or permit condition. Every facility
shall at all times display signage that accurately identifies the facility
owner and provides the facility owner's unique site number, and also provides a
local or toll-free telephone number to contact the facility owner's operations
center. All required or permitted signage must face toward the street or
otherwise placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures.

IMAGES/0-0-0-868.png]
         b.   Design Standards In Special Aesthetic/Economic Purpose Zones:
            (1)   Applicability: These design standards shall apply to
facilities in the right-of-way located in: a) each area, district, neighborhood
or zone expressly designated in the Village's comprehensive plan as having
special aesthetic or economic impacts on the welfare of the community; and b)
each redevelopment area designed under the Tax Increment Allocation
Redevelopment Act or the Business District Development and Redevelopment Act.
            (2)   Purpose: To protect and promote the Village's unique
character in a manner consistent with State and Federal laws and regulations.
               (A)   Siting of small wireless facilities in special aesthetic/
economic purpose zones must respect the existing character or design ordinance
of established zone.
               (B)   Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment
measures in their applications.
               (C)   Concealment of all small wireless facilities so that the
facility is completely hidden from view when view from ground-level.
               (D)   Effective camouflage so as to disguise the facility so
that it appears to be something other than a facility and is at the same time
compatible with its surroundings (for example, designed to look like a tree).
               (E)   Small wireless facilities must be designed so that the
facilities' silhouette, mass and color are masked in such a way as to be
virtually indistinguishable from their background.
               (F)   Examples of stealth or camouflage designs are presented in
figure 1 of this section.
         c.   Design Standards In Historic Districts:
            (1)   Applicability: These design standards apply in facilities in
the right-of-way located in any historic district or on any historic landmark.
            (2)   Purpose: To promote the educational, cultural, economic and
general welfare of the Village by identifying, preserving, protecting,
enhancing and encouraging the continued utilization and the rehabilitation of
such areas, properties, structures, sites and objects having a special
historical interest or value to the Village and its citizens.
               (A)   Districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects,
significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or
culture, that are listed, or are eligible for listing, in the National Register
of Historic Places are to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible. Local
landmarked buildings, properties, sites, or historic districts that are so
recognized by an ordinance that meets the requirements of the certified Local
Government Program of the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office are also
to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible.
               (B)   Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment
measures in their applications.
               (C)   Applicant must implement said Village- approved design
concepts, and the use of camouflage or stealth materials as necessary in order
to achieve compliance with historic preservation review.
               (D)   Prior to submitting an application, where the applicant
submits an application to site facilities in a historic district, the applicant
must meet with the Village to discuss any potential design modifications
appropriate for the installation.
               (E)   When siting a facility in a historic district, wireless
provider must avoid removing, obscuring or altering any historic material or
significant architectural features. Rehabilitation and make-ready work must not
destroy the distinguishing character of the property or its environment.
               (F)   Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired
rather than replaced, wherever possible by means such as rust removal, calking,
limited paint removal and reapplication of paint.
      4.   Minimizing Visibility: All small wireless facilities not governed by
the preceding design standards must be placed so as to minimize visibility. The
small wireless facility, including all ancillary equipment and appurtenances,
must be a color that blends with the surroundings of the utility pole or
Municipally-owned infrastructure on which it is mounted and use non-reflective
materials which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and
structures. Any wiring must be concealed within the freestanding facility or
covered with an appropriate cover.
      5.   Concealment Elements: A facility may not be installed in a manner
which defeats any existing concealment elements of the utility pole or
Municipally-owned infrastructure to which it is attached.
      6.   Common Ownership: Facilities under common ownership or operated on
the same radio frequency shall be separated as far as practicable.
      7.   Height Limitations: Small wireless facilities are limited to a
maximum height of ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless structure
on which it is collocated. The height limit of a new or replacement utility
pole or wireless support structure on which small wireless facilities are
collocated is limited to the higher of: a) ten feet (10') higher than the
tallest existing utility pole within three hundred feet (300') of the new or
replacement utility pole or wireless support structure that is in the same
right-of-way; or b) forty five feet (45') above ground level. The Village shall
designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of
the proposed utility pole or wireless support structure shall control the
height limitation.
   F.   Aboveground Facilities: Aboveground facilities may be installed only
if:
      1.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      2.   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      3.   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and Municipally- owned infrastructure shall be
used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles or
monopoles is strongly discouraged.
      4.   The Village is not required to install or maintain any specific
utility pole or to continue to install or maintain utility poles in any
location if it makes a non-discriminatory decision to eliminate above-ground
utility poles of a particular type. For Village utility poles with collocated
small wireless facilities in place when the Village makes a decision to
eliminate above-ground utility poles, the Village will, at its discretion,
either maintain the utility pole or install and maintain an alternative utility
pole for the collocation of the small wireless facility, or offer to sell the
utility pole to the wireless provider.

foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair;
and 2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      6.   Minimum Cover Of Underground Facilities: Cover shall be provided and
maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for minimum
cover for the type of facility:

8-1-11: VEGETATION CONTROL:
   A.   Tree Trimming:
      1.   Permit Requirements:
         a.   Tree trimming shall not be considered a normal maintenance
operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a
permit, in addition to any other permit required under this chapter.
         b.   Applications for tree trimming permits shall include assurance
that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who
are experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall
designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be
expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   B.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   C.   Chemical Use: Spraying of any type of brush killing chemicals will not
be permitted on rights-of-way unless the wireless provider or utility
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the engineer that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control. (Ord. O-18-11, 7-17-2018)
8-1-12: REMOVAL, RELOCATION OR MODIFICATIONS:
   A.   Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the Village, a
wireless provider or utility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or
permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any facilities
within the rights-of- way whenever the Corporate Authorities have determined
that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary
for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village
improvement in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or upon, the
rights-of-way. Wireless providers are required to provide the Village with
written notice of its intent to sell or transfer small wireless facilities.
Such notice must include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider.
   B.   Within thirty (30) days following written notice from the Village, any
wireless provider or utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized
facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-way shall, at its
own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from
the public rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   C.   The Village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any
facilities located within the rights-of-way of the Village, as the Village may
determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public
health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the Village shall attempt
to notify the wireless provider or utility, if known, prior to cutting or
removing a facility and shall notify the wireless provider or utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Upon abandonment of a utility within the public rights-of- way of the
Village, the utility shall notify the Village within ninety (90) days.
Following receipt of such notice, the Village may direct the utility to remove
all or any portion of the utility facility if the Village Engineer determines
that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and
welfare. In the event that the Village does not direct the utility that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
With respect to small wireless facilities, a small wireless facility that is
not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered
abandoned. The owner of an abandoned small wireless facility shall notify the
Village within ninety (90) days of it being abandoned and the owner of that
small wireless facility must remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after sending such written notice to the Village. The Village may
direct the wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the facility if
the Village Engineer determines that such removal will be in the best interest
of the public health, safety and welfare. If the small wireless facility is not
removed within ninety (90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause
the removal of the facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment
agreement for Village utility poles or through whatever actions are provided
for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery. (Ord.

   A.   General Maintenance Requirements: Facilities on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the
wireless provider or utility in a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the
wireless provider's or utility's expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the wireless provider or utility shall take immediate steps to
provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on
the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If
a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the wireless provider or utility shall, as soon as
possible, notify the Village Engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of
the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the Village police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the wireless provider or utility shall use all
means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The wireless provider or utility must file, in
writing, with the Village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-
of-way within forty eight (48) hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. O-18-11,

variance from one or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in
writing to the Village Engineer as a part of the permit application. The
request shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The Village Engineer shall decide whether
a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions:
      1.   The Village Engineer may authorize a variance only if the wireless
provider or utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
         a.   One or more conditions not under the control of the wireless
provider or utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way
line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
         b.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
      2.   As a condition for authorizing a variance, the Village Engineer may
require the wireless provider or utility requesting the variance to meet
reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained
within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. O-
18-11, 7-17-2018)
8-1-16: PENALTIES:
   A.   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when
the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the wireless provider or utility will not or cannot perform its duties
under its permit and this chapter. Unless the wireless provider or utility
shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action
is appropriate, the wireless provider or utility shall bear the Village costs
of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a wireless
provider or utility that does not pay the costs apportioned thereto.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

9-5-3-1: PRELIMINARY CONSULTATION:
   A.   The subdivider will meet with Village Staff for the purpose of
presenting a Concept Plan, including but not limited to the following:
      1.   Written notification in the form of a letter of intent from the
subdivider to the Village Staff establishing the subdivider's intent to develop
the land.
      2.   The Concept Plan shall also contain the name, address, fax, phone
and email of the applicant, and shall identify the location of the property. It
shall also include general subdivision information that describes or outlines
the existing conditions of the site and the proposed development as necessary.
This information must include data on existing covenants, zoning
classification, land characteristics, and available community facilities and
utilities; and information describing the subdivision proposal, such as number
of residential, commercial and industrial lots and units broken down by type
and bedroom count (residential only), overall density, typical lot width and
depth, minimum average lot sizes, general land use categories and their
locations surrounding the property, location of any proposed major streets,
public utilities, existing natural features, such as woodland and/or ponds,
school, playground and park areas and other public areas (as applicable),
proposed protective covenants, and proposed utilities and street improvements.
      3.   A plan on a topographic survey that shows, in simple sketch form,
the proposed layout of streets, lots, and other features in relation to
existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a free-hand sketch made directly on
a print of the topographic survey. The sketch plan must include the existing
topographic data and contours of not less than five foot (5') intervals. This
may be attached to USGS topographic data.
      4.   Tentative engineering proposals regarding water supply, sewage
disposal, stormwater drainage, and street improvements.
   B.   The Village staff will discuss the proposed subdivision with the
subdivider and so advise of any Village plans or projects that might affect the
proposed subdivision, the procedural steps, design and improvement standards,
and the general planning requirements. As part of the review the Village staff
will evaluate the following:
      1.   Check the existing zoning of the tract and advise the subdivider if
a zoning change is necessary or desirable.
      2.   Determine the adequacy of existing or proposed schools, parks and
other public spaces in the vicinity of the proposed subdivision.
      3.   Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship to major
streets, utility systems, and adjacent land uses and determine any unusual
problems in regard to topography, utilities, flooding, etc.
      4.   Refer the developer to the appropriate governmental entities, which
may include: fire protection districts, highway districts, sanitary districts
and school districts.
      5.   Advise the developer of the Comprehensive Plan, which delineates the
areas to be served by either public and/or private water and/or sanitary sewer
service. This will determine the feasibility of the proposed subdivision, the
sizes of the utilities and the lots therein. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-3-2: PRELIMINARY PLAT:
   A.   Action By Subdivider: The subdivider will prepare a preliminary plat,
which will include all of the property owned or controlled by the applicant,
which properties are adjacent to the proposed subdivision, together with
improvement plans and other supplementary material, as specified, to be
submitted to the Village Staff with the applicable application and filing fee.
   B.   Action By Planning And Zoning Commission:
      1.   The Village staff will review the preliminary plan for compliance
with these regulations and other ordinances of the Village. The Village Staff
recommendation will then be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      2.   The Planning and Zoning Commission will consider the preliminary
plat within forty five (45) days of receipt of the Village Staff
recommendation. The applicant and the Planning and Zoning Commission may
mutually agree to extend this period. The Planning and Zoning Commission will:
         a.   Recommend approval or disapproval of the proposed preliminary
plat and submit its written recommendations, which include the recommendations
of the Village Staff, to the Village Board.
         b.   Alternatively, if the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that
changes, additions, or corrections are required on the preliminary plat, the
Planning and Zoning Commission will advise the subdivider in writing. The
subdivider may resubmit the preliminary plat to the Planning and Zoning
Commission, without paying an additional fee, for consideration at the next
regular meeting. The Planning and Zoning Commission will, at said meeting,
recommend approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat and submit its
recommendations in writing, which include the recommendations of the Village
Staff, to the Village Board and the subdivider.
   C.   Action By Village Board: The Village Board of Trustees will consider
the preliminary plat within forty five (45) days of receipt of the preliminary
plat after receiving the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
The applicant and the Village Board may mutually agree to extend such
timeframe. The Village Board will:
      1.   Approve or disapprove the proposed preliminary plat.
      2.   Alternatively, if the Village Board finds that changes, additions,
or corrections are required on the preliminary plat, the Village Board will
advise the subdivider in writing and may remand the matter to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for further consideration as provided in subsection B above.
If the matter is not remanded to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
subdivider may resubmit the preliminary plat to the Village Board without
paying an additional fee. The Village Board will, at the meeting where the
revised plat is considered, approve or disapprove the preliminary plat.
   D.   Validity: Approval of the preliminary plat is valid for one year,
unless upon application of the subdivider, the Village Board grants an
extension. The application for said extension does not require an additional
filing fee or the submittal of additional copies of the preliminary plan.
Extensions shall be requested in one-year increments and are limited to a total
of five (5) years upon which the preliminary plat will no longer be valid and a
complete resubmittal, review and approval will be required.
   E.   Notice Of Approval: Upon approval or disapproval of the preliminary
plat by the Village Board, the appropriate following notice must be stamped on
and required signatures affixed to the preliminary plat:

         d.   The subdivider is responsible for the maintenance of the public
improvements as installed until the improvements are completed according to the
approved plans and formally accepted by the Village. Until acceptance, the
subdivider is responsible for snowplowing of the roads and shoveling sidewalks,
as applicable.
      2.   Performance Surety: The Village staff will not certify the approval
of the Village Board on the final plat until the requirements of this section
have been completed.
         a.   Prior to the approval of the final plat of any subdivision, the
subdivider must deposit with the Village performance security in the form of
cash, bond, letter of credit, or other surety acceptable to the Village Board
in an amount not less than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of either the
subdivider's design engineer estimate of the costs for constructing and
installing all of the public and other required improvements (including,
without limitation, stormwater management infrastructure, sediment and erosion
control measures, and landscaping), or the actual cost as shown by all
contracts for construction and installation of all of the public and other
required improvements, whichever is greater. The performance security is for
the purpose of insuring the construction of all of the public and other
required improvements in accordance with the final engineering plans and all
applicable requirements of law.
         b.   The performance security remains in effect at all times until all
of the public and other required improvements have been approved by the Village
staff and the public improvements have been accepted by the Village. If the
public and other required improvements have not been completed and accepted or
approved by the Village thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the
security by its terms is to expire, then the developer must deliver on or
before that date replacement security which by its terms will extend through
the date the public and other required improvements are accepted or approved by
the Village. If the developer fails to so deliver the security, then the
Village has the right at that time, without prior notice to developer, to draw
down the full amount of the existing security.
         c.   If the developer fails or refuses to complete the construction of
any of the public or other required improvements covered by the performance
security, or fails to correct any defect or deficiency in the improvements upon
request by the Village, or fails to increase the security upon the Village's
request, or in any other manner fails or refuses to meet fully the obligations
under the performance security, or the applicable annexation or development
agreement or other approval, then the Village may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, draw on or retain all or any part of the performance security.
         d.   The performance security as approved may be reduced from time to
time as improvements are completed upon recommendation of the Village staff and
approval of the Village Board, provided that one hundred twenty percent (120%)
of the estimated cost of the balance of public improvements or a minimum of
twenty percent (20%) of the original performance security (whichever is
greater) at all times is retained by the Village to secure the completion of
all public improvements and receipt of the following:
            (1)   Written request by owner, developer or subdivider requesting
reduction.
            (2)   An itemized list of the subdivision improvements guaranteed
by the performance security including the design engineer's original opinion of
probable cost for each item, the security amount for each item, the value of
the work completed to date, the value of the work remaining, the requested
reduction amount and the proposed value of the security remaining.
            (3)   A complete or partial "as-built" survey including improvement
elevation and location information.
            (4)   The affidavit and sworn statements of the owner, developer or
subdivider, together with partial and/or full waivers of lien from all
contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers for those items guaranteed
by the performance guarantee.
In no event will the amount of the performance security be reduced to a level
that (i) would not allow the Village to complete the installation of the public
and other improvements required for the subdivision, in the sole and absolute
opinion of the Village staff or (ii) is less than the guaranty security
required by subsection B below.
         e.   If at any time, the Village determines that the performance
security is not sufficient to cover the costs of the remaining public
improvements, the developer is required to increase the amount of the
performance security in an amount determined by the Village to secure the
remaining public improvements.
         f.   The performance surety will not be released until all required
improvements have been inspected and accepted by the Village.
   B.   Guarantee Of Completed Improvements:
      1.   Upon completion of the public improvements, the subdivider must
notify the Village staff in writing and request an inspection of the
improvements. The subdivider will submit, with the request, an as-built plan
covering the improvements to be accepted.
      2.   After the improvements have been inspected by the Village staff and
found to be complete according to the approved plans and specifications, the
public improvements may be accepted by the Village Board.
      3.   The subdivider must guarantee the public improvements against
defective workmanship and/or materials for a period of two (2) years from the
date of acceptance.
      4.   As a precondition to the acceptance of the public improvements by
the Village Board, the subdivider is required to post cash, letter of credit,
or other surety acceptable to the Village Board in the amount of twenty percent
(20%) of the cost of the original public improvements or two thousand dollars
($2,000.00), whichever is greater.
      5.   These funds will be held by the Village and be made available to the
Village to repair defects in material or workmanship which the subdivider fails
to repair or replace within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice in
the event of an emergency repair. After the two (2) year guarantee period, all
remaining funds will be released to the subdivider.
   C.   Subdivisions Outside Corporate Limits: Such agreements, as set forth
above, are not required for subdivisions located in the unincorporated areas
within one and one-half (1.5) miles beyond the Village limits when there is
evidence that agreements are entered into between the owner or subdivider and
Kane County. However, when the Village standards for public improvements are of
higher quality than Kane County standards, such agreements may be required by
the Village.
   D.   Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34: Upon transfer of
the public subdivision improvements to the village, the owner, developer, or
subdivider shall provide a detailed inventory to the village of such public
subdivision improvements, which shall include the engineer's as built
quantities of improvements, their estimated fair market value and their
estimated approximate useful life in accordance with Governmental Accounting
Standards Board Statement 34.
   E.   Transfer Of Private Subdivision Improvements: All stormwater detention/
retention facilities and other private subdivision improvements, after
completion, inspection and approval by the Village Engineer and satisfactory
repair or completion of all deficiencies shall be transferred by the owner,
developer or subdivider, without cost, by bill of sale to and accepted for
ownership, maintenance and operation by a homeowners'/property owners
association or other entity acceptable to the Village for future operation,
maintenance, repair and replacement under such conditions as may be approved by
the Village. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the owner,
developer or subdivider shall be responsible for warranty work on all
subdivision improvements during the warranty period (two (2) years from date of
acceptance). (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)

recommendation of the Village staff, extend the two (2) year period for the
completion of the required improvements provided, that the subdivider has
posted suitable, acceptable surety to ensure the completion of the balance of
the improvements.
   B.   Deeding Of Improvements: All underground public improvements up to the
property line must be deeded over to the Village and will become the property
of the Village after approval by the Village staff and accepted by resolution
of the Village Board. All labor and material for installing underground public
improvements must be furnished by the subdivider. All testing required for
acceptance must be done by the subdivider under the supervision of the Village
staff. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-3-9: ACCEPTANCE OF REQUIRED LAND IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Upon the completion of construction of any required public
improvements, in conformance with approved engineering plans and
specifications, the subdivider must prepare and submit to the Village staff
four (4) sets plus one reproducible set on mylar of as-built plans and

   B.   If any final plat of subdivision contains public streets or
thoroughfares which are therein dedicated as such, whether located within the
corporate limits of the Village or all or in part outside of said corporate
limits, the approval of the final plat by the Village Board or the subsequent
annexation of the property to the Village does not constitute an acceptance,
irrespective of any act or acts by an officer, agent, or employee of the
Village with respect to such streets or improvements. The acceptance of such
streets or thoroughfares must be made by the adoption of a resolution by the
Village Board, after a certificate has been issued by the Village staff
certifying that all improvements required to be constructed or installed in or
upon such streets or thoroughfares, in connection with the approval of the plat
of subdivision, have been fully completed and the construction or installation
has been approved by the Village staff.
   C.   When all items are found to meet the requirements of the Village and
the approved plans and specifications, the Village Engineer shall schedule the
acceptance for the next regular board meeting. The acceptance of the public
subdivision improvements shall be made only by the adoption of a resolution by
the Village Board after all the provisions of this section have been met. (Ord.
O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-3-10: OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS:
During the plat review process and during installation and acceptance of the
required improvements, the Village may engage professional assistance other
than the staff, in order to properly review or observe the improvement proposed
by the applicant. The applicant will be notified in writing that such
professional assistance will be engaged. Prior to such review or observation,
the applicant may meet with the Village staff in order to discuss the activity
and anticipated time line and estimate of expenses. The applicant must
reimburse the Village for costs associated with such professional review
assistance. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-3-11: FEES:
Along with the preliminary plat application, the applicant will deposit an
escrow with the Village a minimum of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) and a
maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) as determined by the Village Board
in accordance with sections
3-2-1 through
3-2-6 of the Village Code. The amount will be used to provide reimbursement to
the Village for Village expenditures for all staff and outside consultants'
time to review and approve plans, specifications, and other documents and for
construction supervision of the approved subdivision improvements. The account
with the deposited funds will be maintained until the subdivision improvements
have been approved. Additional deposits may be required periodically, as
determined by the Village, to maintain a positive balance in the account until
the subdivision has been accepted. (Upon final subdivision acceptance and
completion of the two (2) year maintenance period all remaining funds will be
returned to the applicant.) (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-3-12: INDEMNITY:
The following language must appear on all improvement plans:
   A.   Hold Harmless: The contractor, as a condition of the contract, hereby
agrees to assume the entire responsibility and liability for, and defense of,
and to pay and indemnify and hold the owner, the engineer, the Village, their
engineers, agents, and employees harmless from all claims for damages or injury
or death resulting therefrom to any and all persons, including employees or
agents or any person or firm engaged in work upon the project, arising out of
the conduct of the contractor arising out of the performance of this agreement
or any work relevant thereto, or arising out of any Federal, State, or local
statute, rule, regulation, or ordinance, including, but not limited to, the
provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Act (OSHA).
   B.   Costs, Fees And Expenses: All costs, fees, and expenses, including, by
way of example and without limitation, reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
court reporter fees, transcript costs, subpoena fees and costs, witness fees,

   C.   Insurance: The contractor(s) must name the Village of Campton Hills and
any consultant doing construction observation for the Village as additional
named insured on all liability insurance policies and provide the Village with
certificates of insurance prior to commencement of any work. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-
4-2020)
9-5-4: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
9-5-4-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The design of a subdivision must conform to the Zoning Ordinance and
any other applicable ordinances, these regulations, all ordinances pertaining
to the control of land development, and to all applicable rules, regulations,
specifications, and standards of the Village, County, and the State. No
deviation from approved plans and specifications may be made without approval
of the Village.
   B.   Where a subdivision lies within one and one-half (1.5) miles of the
corporate limits, the subdivision must also conform to all applicable
ordinances and plans of the Village. In all instances where a requirement of
this Chapter, or other applicable ordinance of the Village, is similar to, or
in conflict with other provisions of the ordinances of the County, the most
restrictive provision applies.
   C.   If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the
subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning Ordinance or this
Chapter, such restrictions or a reference thereto may be required to be
indicated on the final plat, or the Village Board may require that restrictive
covenants be recorded with the Kane County Recorder.
   D.   The design of each subdivision must take into consideration the
preservation, capabilities and limitation of topography, drainage, soils,
vegetation, and other features and irreplaceable assets of the site. The use of
lands unsuited to development because of, but not limited to, flood,
inundation, and soil characteristics will not be approved unless the
development of the lands meets the requirements of the ordinances and
regulations of the Village.
   E.   Each subdivider and/or developer is required to furnish and install
fences at the boundaries of the subdivision when the Village Board determines
that a hazardous or nuisance condition may or could exist. The fences must be
constructed according to the standards established by the Village and in
accordance with the Zoning Ordinance. Fence improvements will be made part of
the improvement plans and construction guarantee provisions. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-
4-2020)
9-5-4-2: MINIMUM STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS:
All construction of improvements covered by this Chapter must be in accordance
and materials used must be in compliance with the methods and materials
required in the appropriate sections of the latest editions, amendments or
revisions of the following:
   A.   "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction," Illinois
Department of Transportation;

   N.   The Kane County Division of the Transportation Road Standards;
   O.   The Kane County Health Department Private Sewage Disposal System Code.
(Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-3: OVERSIZE DESIGN:
Where required in the overall utility planning, as evidenced by the master
plans for water distribution, sanitary sewers, and stormwater management, any
public improvement required to be larger than necessary to serve the immediate
subdivision adequately, the Village may enter into an agreement to repay the
subdivider the construction cost resulting from the increased design. All
engineering, insurance, and inspection costs must be paid by the subdivider.
This applies, but is not limited, to collector sewers, lift stations, disposal
facilities, wells, pumping stations, water mains, storage tanks, culverts,
storm sewers, etc. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-4: OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS:
If it is determined that any existing infrastructure including, but not limited
to, water distribution systems, sanitary sewers or other wastewater treatment
facilities, storm sewers, or other stormwater management facilities and roads,
which may be situated either in part or entirely off-site, is inadequate to
facilitate a proposed subdivision when one hundred percent (100%) built-out,
then improvements to any one or all of such facilities may be required. (Ord.
O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-5: LOT DESIGN:
   A.   The lots must be arranged so that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography, soils, flooding or other conditions,
in securing permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance, these regulations, and the sewage treatment and disposal system
rules and regulations. Subdivisions cannot contain leftover pieces, corners, or
remnants of lands.
   B.   All lots must meet the minimum depth, width, and area requirements of
the applicable district in the Zoning Ordinance. Where the Kane County Health
Department requires a larger lot size because of connection to septic, the lot
sizes must be increased by twenty five percent (25%) more area than that
required by the County (i.e., one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the
size required by the County). In no circumstances may a lot be reduced below
the lot width and area required by the Zoning Ordinance unless a variance or
exception is approved separately.
   C.   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and
industrial purposes must be adequate to provide for the off-road service and
parking facilities required by the applicable district of the Zoning Ordinance.
   D.   Excessive depth in relation to width must be avoided. A proportion of
2.5:1 is considered a desirable maximum for lot widths of one hundred feet
(100') or more. Side lot lines must be substantially at right angles or radial
to road lines. Lots at right angles to each other should be avoided wherever
possible.
   E.   Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the road
by which it has access, provisions must be made for installation of a culvert
or other structure of design approved by the Village.
   F.   Lots must be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all
building sites and individual lot drainage must be coordinated with the general
storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage must be designed so as to avoid
concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.
Stormwater management system must be designed so as to avoid conveyance of
public runoff through private property. Public runoff should remain in the
public road stormwater system.
   G.   Every lot must front or abut on a dedicated public road. Lots with an
access only to existing private drives or private roads are permitted only in
unusual circumstances subject to approval by the Village staff and the Village
Board. The fronting of residential lots on major roads and county highways is
prohibited.
   H.   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots must be avoided except where
necessary to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation and
where limited-access highway, railroad right-of-way, major road, county
highway, or similar situation exists, in which case double frontage lots are
preferred, provided suitable screen-planting contained in a no-access
reservation along the property line and right-of-way is provided.
   I.   The creation of new flag lots is prohibited. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-6: SLOPE AND GRADE:
   A.   The minimum and maximum slopes along a residential lot line must be as
follows:
      1.   Side lot line the slopes must be equal to or greater than two
percent (2%) but no greater than ten percent (10%).
      2.   Street lot line slopes (those parallel to the street) must have
minimum and maximum grades equal to the street on which they front.
      3.   Rear lot lines must have a minimum slope equal to or greater than
two percent (2%) but no greater than ten percent (10%).
   B.   The minimum and maximum slopes within a residential lot must be as
follows:
      1.   All slopes must be directed away from the structure equal to or
greater than two percent (2%) but no greater than ten percent (10%).
      2.   On lots where there is a structure with a lookout or walkout
basement, the side slopes (parallel to the structure) must be equal to or
greater than two percent (2%) but no greater than one foot vertical for every
four feet of horizontal distance (1:4).
      3.   The Village may allow slopes up to one foot vertical for every three
feet of horizontal distance (1:3) for special situations and only on a case by
case basis.
   C.   If the grade differential between adjoining rear yards cannot be
accommodated, then a retaining wall no higher than thirty inches (30") measured
from the ground at the highest point must be incorporated into the grading
plan. The retaining wall will be offset from property line to allow for one lot
owner to perform any maintenance tasks associated with the wall including
mowing grass at the foot of the wall.
   D.   All grades must be at the proposed grade plus or minus 0.1 foot, and
all slopes cannot deviate from the proposed slope by more than ten percent
(10%), but in no case shall any slope be less than two percent (2%). (Ord. O-
20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-7: BLOCKS:
The length, width, and shape of blocks must be such as are appropriate for the
locality and the type of development contemplated, but block length in
residential areas cannot exceed one thousand five hundred feet (1,500'), nor
have less than sufficient width to provide two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate
depth between road lines, except for blocks with one tier of lots which meet
the double frontage requirements of this Section. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-8: EASEMENTS:
   A.   Utility Easements: Utility easements must be provided at the rear of
all lots and along the side and front lot lines when required. On wooded sites,
utility easements must be located so as to minimize environmental damage.
Utility easements must be at least ten feet (10') wide, and normally centered
upon the rear or side lot lines. Evidence must be furnished to the Village that
easements and any easement provisions to be incorporated on the final plat or
in the deeds have been reviewed by the individual utility companies or
organizations responsible for furnishing the services. The wording of utility
easements on the final plat must be in accordance with the Village standards.
   B.   Drainage And Stormwater Management Easements:
      1.   Stormwater Management Easements: Stormwater management easements
shall be required in all areas for purposes of operating and maintaining
stormwater runoff management facilities such as detention and/or retention
basins and appurtenant structures and overland flood routes. As determined by
the Village Engineer, the final plat shall include the provisions for
stormwater management easements, in substantially the following form:
A NON-EXCLUSIVE EASEMENT IS HEREBY RESERVED FOR AND GRANTED TO THE HOMEOWNERS'
OR PROPERTY OWNER'S ASSOCIATION AS MAY BE FURTHER DEFINED IN THE HOMEOWNERS' OR
PROPERTY OWNER'S ASSOCIATION BYLAWS AND DECLARATIONS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, WITHIN THE AREAS SO DESIGNATED ON THE PLAT AND MARKED
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT EASEMENT (SME) FOR THE COLLECTION CONVEYANCE AND STORAGE
OF STORMWATER IN AREAS TO BE MAINTAINED BY THE OWNER OF THE LOT(S) OR OUTLOT(S)
ON WHICH THE FACILITIES EXIST IN ACCORDANCE WITH MUNICIPAL ORDINANCES AND THE
APPROVED FINAL ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENT PLANS; TOGETHER WITH THE RIGHT OF ACCESS
THERETO FOR THE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT NECESSARY AND REQUIRED FOR SUCH USES
AND PURPOSES, AND TOGETHER WITH THE RIGHT TO CUT, TRIM, OR REMOVE TREES, BUSHES
AND ROOTS AS MAY BE REASONABLY REQUIRED INCIDENTAL TO THE RIGHTS HEREIN GIVEN,
AND THE RIGHT TO ENTER UPON THE PROPERTY FOR ALL SUCH PURPOSES. ENCROACHMENT OF
ANY KIND INCLUDING LANDSCAPING, FENCES, SHEDS OR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES WITHIN
SAID EASEMENT IS PROHIBITED UNLESS THE MUNICIPAL ENGINEER HAS DETERMINED SAID
ENCROACHMENT WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PROPER FUNCTION OF SAID FACILITIES.
THE VILLAGE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO ENTER WITH
PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT UPON SAID EASEMENT AT ANY TIME FOR THE PURPOSES OF
ACCESS TO AND INSPECTION OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES LOCATED WITHIN
SAID EASEMENT. IF THE OWNER FAILS TO MAINTAIN SAID FACILITIES AND, AFTER
RECEIPT OF NOTICE FROM THE VILLAGE OF SAID FAILURE, THE OWNER FAILS TO MAKE
REQUIRED REPAIRS IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF AN
EMERGENCY THE VILLAGE MAY MAKE THE REQUIRED REPAIRS. THE VILLAGE MAY SEEK
REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE OWNER FOR THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE VILLAGE TO MAKE THE
REPAIR AND/OR FILE A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY.
      2.   Drainage Easements: Areas where a subdivision is traversed by a
water course, drainage way, channel or stream, the drainage easement shall
conform substantially with the lines of such water course and shall include
further width as will be necessary for the purpose of adequately maintaining or
improving the water course. Said easements shall not be used for any other
purposes except that utilities may cross this easement, provided that the
crossing does not alter the intended use of the easement. Drainage easements
are for the express purpose of providing easements for water courses, drainage
ways, channels or streams. Public storm sewers should be contained within
municipal utility easements. Private storm sewers and drainage swales should be
contained within private storm water easements. Detention/retention areas and
overland flood routes should be contained within stormwater management
easements. As determined by the Village Engineer, the final plat shall include
the provisions for drainage easements, in substantially the following form:
AN EXCLUSIVE EASEMENT IS HEREBY RESERVED FOR AND GRANTED TO THE PROPERTY
OWNER'S ASSOCIATION AS MAY BE FURTHER DEFINED IN THE PROPERTY OWNER'S
ASSOCIATION BYLAWS AND DECLARATIONS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS, WITHIN THE AREAS SO DESIGNATED ON THE PLAT AND MARKED DRAINAGE
EASEMENT (DE) OVER THOSE AREAS WHERE THE SUBDIVISION IS TRAVERSED BY A WATER
COURSE, DRAINAGE WAY, CHANNEL OR STREAM. THE DRAINAGE EASEMENT CONFORMS
SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE LINES OF SUCH WATER COURSE AND INCLUDES FURTHER WIDTH AS
WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADEQUATELY MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING THE
WATER COURSE. TOGETHER WITH THE RIGHT OF ACCESS THERETO FOR THE PERSONNEL AND
EQUIPMENT NECESSARY AND REQUIRED FOR SUCH USES AND PURPOSES, AND TOGETHER WITH
THE RIGHT TO CUT, TRIM, OR REMOVE TREES, BUSHES AND ROOTS AS MAY BE REASONABLY
REQUIRED INCIDENTAL TO THE RIGHTS HEREIN GIVEN, AND THE RIGHT TO ENTER UPON THE
PROPERTY FOR ALL SUCH PURPOSES. NO PERMANENT BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES OR FENCES
SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED OR MAINTAINED ON, ACROSS OVER OR THROUGH SAID EASEMENT
WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE GRANTEE AND THE VILLAGE OF SPRING GROVE.
SAID EASEMENTS SHALL NOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES EXCEPT THAT UTILITIES
MAY CROSS THIS EASEMENT, PROVIDED THAT THE CROSSING DOES NOT ALTER THE INTENDED
USE OF THE EASEMENT. THE VILLAGE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION,
TO ENTER WITH PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT UPON SAID EASEMENT AT ANY TIME FOR THE
PURPOSES OF ACCESS TO AND INSPECTION OF THE WATERCOURSES, DRAINAGE WAYS,
CHANNELS AND STREAMS LOCATED WITHIN SAID EASEMENT. IF THE OWNER FAILS TO
MAINTAIN SAID FACILITIES AND, AFTER RECEIPT OF NOTICE FROM THE VILLAGE OF SAID

shall be shown on the preliminary and final plats of subdivision. (Ord. O-20-
13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-4-9: RIGHTS-OF-WAY:
   A.   General Requirements:
      1.   All road and road right-of-way improvements must be designed in
substantial relation to topographic conditions, drainage, public convenience,
safety, and the proposed uses of the land to be served by such roads. All road
and road right-of-way improvements must conform to the applicable standards of
the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Kane County Division of the
Transportation, and the local Township Highway Commissioner.
      2.   A public road must be provided for convenient access to all property
and lots within a subdivision. Private roads and easements of access are
prohibited except unless approved by the Village Board in consideration of
topography, existing natural features, and/or terrain and after consultation
with the Township Highway Commissioner. All private roads must be built to
Village specifications and standards with Village inspection approval provided
during construction.
      3.   Roads must be laid out in conformity to road or highway plans
officially adopted by the Village, County, or the Illinois Division of
Highways. Wherever such a planned road or highway runs through a proposed
subdivision, it must be provided for in the place, and with the width
indicated, on said plan. However, no more than one hundred twenty foot (120')
right-of-way width dedication is required for any road. Any additional right-
of-way specified on said plan must be reserved for circulation purposes by
easement provisions to be acquired at a later date by the public agency
involved.
      4.   Where roads are not a part of the official map or officially adopted
road or highway plans, the arrangement of the roads in a subdivision must
either provide for the alignment and continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal roads in surrounding areas or conform to an approved plan
for the development that meets a particular situation where topography or other
conditions make continuation of or conformance to existing roads impracticable.
   B.   Roadway Classifications: All existing and planned roads must be
classified according to the following:
      1.   Major roads are those whose primary purpose is to carry high volumes
of traffic, with trip lengths generally over one mile. All marked state and
federal routes, and those county and township roads and other roads so
designated by the County are considered major roads and subject to County
standards.
      2.   Collector roads are those whose purpose is to collect and distribute
medium to low traffic volumes between major and local roads. Collector roads
should be inter-neighborhood roads and particularly related to serving specific
traffic generating facilities such as schools, churches, commercial, or
employment areas, and other areas of greater traffic generation. All county
highways and some township roads are considered collector roads.
      3.   Local roads are those whose primary purpose is to provide access to
abutting property. They should be laid out so as to discourage through traffic.
All roads other than major and collectors are considered local roads.
The Village Engineer shall be responsible for determining roadway
classifications.
   C.   Right-Of-Way Widths: Where not otherwise specified, road right-of-way
widths must be as follows; however, these may be modified by the Village on a
case-by-case basis.
 
Right-of-Way     Total ROW Width Pavement Width Driving Lane(s) Parking Lane(s)
Type
Local Curb &     66'             30'            2               0
Gutter
Local No Curb &  66'             24'            2               0

Collector        80'             36'            2               1
Collector Curb & 80'             36'            2               1
Gutter
 
   D.   Reserve Strips And Half Roads: Reserve or "spite" strips controlling
access to roads are prohibited. Half roads are not permitted, except to provide
right-of-way for officially adopted, planned roads. Whenever an existing half
road is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the road must
be platted within such tract to be subdivided or the existing half road must be
vacated prior to final approval.
   E.   Cul-De-Sac Streets: Cul-de-sacs are discouraged and may only be
permitted where exceptional conditions exist in topography. If a cul-de-sac is
included within any development, the developer shall pay the cul-de-sac impact
fee as set forth in Chapter 20.02, "Fees." Where cul-de-sacs may be allowed,
they shall conform to the following standards:
      1.   No more than one cul-de-sac per each one hundred (100) lots
(inclusive of the lot proposed to front on the cul-de-sacs) shall be permitted
in any residential subdivision.
      2.   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be five hundred feet (500')
as measured from its origin with the right-of-way of the intersecting street
through the center point of the bulb to the end of the right-of-way.
      3.   The bulb of a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum right-of-way of one
hundred twenty feet (120') in diameter.
      4.   The bulb of a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum pavement diameter as
measured from the back of curb, of ninety feet (90').
      5.   A maximum of six (6) lots shall have frontage on the bulb of a cul-
de-sac in any residential district.
      6.   The use of cul-de-sac streets shall be prohibited in commercial
districts.
   F.   Geometries: The geometries of all road improvements must conform to the
following, unless necessitated by exceptional topography or other conditions
and approved by the Village Engineer:
      1.   The grade of all roads cannot exceed seven percent (7%). The grade
of all cul-de-sacs cannot exceed five percent (5%). A combination of steep
grades and curves must be avoided. The minimum longitudinal grade is one-half
percent (0.5%). Ditches must maintain a minimum grade of one percent (1%).
      2.   The minimum sight distance must be in accordance with the standards
set forth in the Kane County DOT Access Control Regulations. The minimum
centerline radius must be one hundred fifty feet (150') for local roads, three
hundred feet (300') for collector roads and five hundred feet (500') for major
roads.
      3.   The minimum vertical curve length required is calculated by
multiplying the algebraic difference in grades times the thirty (30) mph "K"
factor, unless otherwise specified. Minimum vertical curve shall be fifty feet
(50') in length. Grade breaks are allowed up to one percent (1%) algebraic
difference.
      4.   A tangent of at least one hundred feet (100') in length must be
introduced between vertical and horizontal reverse curves on local roads and at
least three hundred feet (300') on major and collector roads.
      5.   The intersection of local roads with major arterials and collector
roads must be designed so that there is no jog in the centerline alignment. The
intersection of local roads within a subdivision must also be designed without
a jog.
      6.   All road intersections must be at right angles unless unusual
topographic or other sight conditions require a lesser angle.
      7.   All corner radii must be a minimum of twenty five feet (25'). ROW
corner cuts may be required where residential collectors meet similar or larger
streets. ROW at residential street/lot corners should be rounded behind the
twenty five foot (25') curb radii.
   G.   Design And Construction Standards:
      1.   Street Pavements: Pavements shall be designed and constructed so as
to obtain a minimum twenty (20) year service life with minimal maintenance
after acceptance of the pavement by the Village of Campton Hills. The design
engineer should consider such factors as construction and end use traffic
loading sub-base IBR, etc., in determining the structural make-up of the
pavement section.

grade material having an IBR less than 3.0 shall be removed and replaced with a
suitable fill material, or the pavement must be designed to compensate for the
soil condition. The soil support IBR values selected for use by the engineer
shall represent a minimum value for the soil to be used.
Structural design procedures acceptable under this section require the
determination of the sub-grade support strength. Regardless of the design
method used, a soils report shall be submitted by a soils testing laboratory,
approved by the Village Engineer, in which sub-grade support strength is
recommended. The soils report shall provide recommendation for sub-grade
improvements. Field compaction tests, where required by the Village Engineer to
verify conformance with the soils report recommendations, shall be provided at
the owner/developer's expense. Proof rolling of sub-grade materials in
accordance with applicable articles of Section 300 of the IDOT Standard
Specifications will be required for all pavement construction. When required,
soil borings shall extend seven feet (7') or at least one foot (1') below the
proposed storm sewer invert elevations, whichever is greater. Pavement cores
shall be provided in all areas where the existing pavement is to be
rehabilitated/resurfaced.

(40°).
      2.   In commercial and industrial areas and other areas where heavy
traffic is likely, roads must meet a minimum pavement structural number of 2.0
for local roads and 3.3 for collector roads or as determined by a structural
analysis per IDOT standards.
      3.   The roads must be graded to conform as near as practical to the
typical cross-section and approved by the Village before the base course can be
applied. Drainage facilities must be completed prior to the installation of
base course material.
      4.   The base course material must conform to specifications as shown on
the typical cross-section sheet and deposited on the prepared sub-grade with an
approved mechanical spreader or spreader box. The base course must be approved
by the Village before the bituminous binder course is applied.
      5.   After spreading the material to required width, the base course must
be rolled with pneumatic-tired roller to a compacted thickness after rolling of
not less than twelve inches (12"). A bituminous surface plant mix conforming to
state specifications must then be constructed on the prepared surface.
      6.   Subsequent to the construction of the sub-grade, road base, and
bituminous surface, the following must be submitted to the Village from a
certified testing company:
         a.   A report showing satisfactory subgrade compaction.

thickness, and quality.
      7.   Stream crossings are limited to the minimum necessary to provide
safe circulation and ensure two (2) ingress/egress locations, subject to
approval by the Village Staff and Village Board. Stream crossings must be
located to minimize stream disturbance. Bridges or culverts of sufficient size
must be used for all perennial stream crossings to preserve stream channel
width and natural stream substrates.
      8.   When land adjacent to an existing road is subdivided and the
existing road is not improved to a standard as high as that required for
proposed subdivision roads, the subdivider is required to improve the existing
road if it is used for access to the proposed subdivision.

regulations.
      2.   In subdivisions not relying on septic systems, there must be a
complete wastewater collection system, including a service connection for each
lot and a sewage treatment plant, land application treatment system or such
other disposal facilities. All municipal type sewerage systems must be designed
and constructed in accordance with applicable State, County, and local plans,
standards and regulations and in accordance with accepted modern sanitary
engineering practices.
All wastewater collection systems shall meet the requirements of the Wasco
Sanitary District.
      3.   No municipal type sewerage system is permitted in an area to be
serviced by the orderly extension of municipal sewerage facilities and no
community or individual sewerage system will be permitted which will interfere
with any municipal plans for the orderly extension of municipal sewerage
facilities.
      4.   Provision must be made for the maintenance and operation of such
treatment plant or facility and shall be stated on the final plat and
covenants, if any, and incorporated in the deed of each lot if charges are to
be made to the property owners.
   B.   Water Supply And Distribution: All community water supply systems must

ordinance, such ordinance applies.
      2.   The design of the drainage system must consider and show:
         a.   Watershed area of which the subdivision is a part.
         b.   Calculations as to volume and frequency of water to be handled
after extreme rainstorms.
         c.   A scheme of culverts, field tiles, storm drains, and storm water
management facilities sufficient in size to eliminate flooding or uncontrolled
ponding of water either on site or off site. The final engineering plans shall
provide culvert sizes and slopes for each lot driveway on roads with street
ditches. Culverts shall be appropriately sized for at minimum, a ten (10) year
storm event, with adequate cover provided. Culverts crossing streets shall be
sized for a minimum twenty five (25) year storm event with adequate cover
provided. Calculations shall be provided substantiating culvert sizes and
slopes based on tributary drainage area.
         d.   The use of existing drainage channels whenever possible.

         a.   With grades to four percent (4%), ditches must be seeded and
covered with mulch or excelsior blanket. Ditches may be required to have sod
bottoms and banks and ditch checks may be required at critical points.
         b.   With grades from four percent (4%) to eight percent (8%), ditches
must have sod channels and ditch checks. Ditches may be required to be lined
with rock or paved with concrete gutters.
         c.   With grades greater than eight percent (8%), ditches must be rock
lined or paved with concrete gutters.
         d.   Corrugated metal or equal culverts with safety end treatments and
grates must be provided at all road or driveway intersections, sized to
eliminate flooding or ponding, but not less than fifteen inches (15") in
diameter, and with a minimum subgrade cover of six inches (6").
         e.   Street ditches shall: (i) have sufficient energy dissipation at
the outlet to prevent scouring of the streambank, bed, or downstream land.
Armoring of the stream channel should not be considered in lieu of energy
dissipation. Energy dissipation is essential to avoid transferring scour and
stability problems further downstream. (ii) To the extent possible, open-
channel drainageways should have permanently deep-rooted vegetated side slopes
and inverts with velocities sufficiently limited to prevent scouring.
         f.   Manmade swales and ditches shall meet the following minimum
standards. Ditches and culverts may be used in lieu of storm sewers if curbs
and gutters are not required. Ditches shall meet the following minimum
standards: (i) minimum longitudinal grade of two percent (2.0%); (ii) maximum
longitudinal grade of ten percent (10%); (iii) minimum depth of twenty-four
inches (24") below the shoulder of the street; (iv) swale cross sections shall
be trapezoidal with two foot (2') minimum bottom. Maximum bank slope of 4:
1 under normal conditions with 6:1 slope recommended on the lot owner's side of
the ditch; (v) the storm system shall be designed with "positive street and
swale drainage" such that in the event of a complete storm system failure,
storm water runoff will be directed overland to the storm water detention area
in a manner to minimize property damage due to flooding. Whenever practicable,
all areas of the property must be provided an emergency overland flow path that
will pass the entire calculated one hundred (100) year flow at a stage at least
one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grades in the vicinity of the flow
path (one foot (1') minimum freeboard), even when one hundred (100) year storm
sewer is provided, regardless of the size of the drainage area. Emergency
overland flow paths shall be provided in drainage easements, which cannot be
obstructed.
      4.   The following criteria will be used in planning and designing the
ground water drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity
for ground water or nuisance flows in a pipe or tile in order to keep yards and
ditches from becoming wet in dry weather.
         a.   Ground water or nuisance flow systems must be designed by using
the information found in the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension
Service Circular #1226, Illinois drainage guide for sizing of drain tiles.
Drainage coefficients for sub-surface drains of one-half inch (.5") per day or
less must be used when designing ground water drainage systems for wet or
perched water table soils in order to not increase base flows in receiving
streams.
         b.   All septic system curtain drains and all sump pumps must be
connected to a new ground water (also called nuisance or subsurface) drainage
system. The new ground water drainage system must be routed around stormwater
storage basins and cannot drain into old existing agricultural drain tiles.
They must be connected to an existing or proposed wet pond or stream, or
extended off site to a stream. All new ground water drainage system pipes, both
on site and off site, must be placed within a minimum ten foot (10') wide
drainage easement. No footing tiles may be connected by gravity to a ground
water drainage system.
         c.   Ground water drainage systems must be kept separated, in general,
from storm sewer systems to avoid hydraulic surcharging of the ground water
drainage system. However, ground water systems may drain into storm sewer
systems or utilize the same pipe as the storm sewer system provided all
essential design criteria of a separate ground water system can be met and both
of the following are met:
            (1)   The storm sewer system drains to an on-site wet pond,
wetland, or stream.
            (2)   The ground water drainage system will not be hydraulically
surcharged by storm water flows, including the prevention of hydraulic
overloading of sump pump services and septic system curtain drains.
   D.   Underground Wiring:
      1.   All lines for telephone, electricity, television, and other similar
services distributed by wire or cable to be placed underground entirely
throughout the subdivided area unless otherwise approved by the Village Board.
      2.   Such conduits or cables must be placed within easements or within
public ways where necessary, provided only that overhead lines may be permitted
where it is determined that overhead lines will not constitute a detriment to
the health, safety, welfare, and character of the subdivision.
      3.   All such facilities placed in dedicated public ways or easements
must be planned so as not to conflict with other underground utilities.
      4.   Electrical transformers and telephone junction boxes cannot be
placed in any portion of a designated drainage or storm water control facility.
      5.   All such facilities must be constructed in accordance with standards
approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission and in conformance with the
franchise of said utilities.
   E.   Storm Sewer And Stormwater Management:
      1.   Design Requirements:
         a.   Auger: Auguring will be required at all roadway crossings unless

edition. Flared end sections shall be constructed of a concrete material only
or approved by the Village Engineer.
   F.   Best Management Practices Requirements: Compliance with the need to
incorporate the U.S. EPA best management practices requires nothing beyond the
requirements cited in the U.S. Clean Water Act.
      1.   Impervious surfaces on the property should be minimized. Reducing
impervious surfaces is one method for controlling increases of stormwater
runoff, and, controlling future increases in stormwater damages. This method of
reducing stormwater increases also provides control at the most site-specific
or local level possible.
      2.   Natural flow paths and vegetated channels should be used and left
undisturbed to the maximum extent possible. By using natural drainage features
and keeping them undisturbed, site-specific and simple methods can be employed
as encouraged by the Plan.
      3.   On-site infiltration of stormwater should be encouraged where soils
and subsurface conditions are sufficiently permeable. As encouraged by the
Plan, onsite infiltration accomplishes site-specific or local control of future
increases in stormwater damages while preserving groundwater recharge.
      4.   To the extent practicable, drainage from impervious areas (i.e.,
roofs, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and streets) should drain across
pervious areas. Directing drainage from impervious areas across pervious areas
is one method to control increases of stormwater runoff, and thus control
future increases in stormwater damages. This method of reducing stormwater
increases will also provide control at the most site specific or local level
possible.
      5.   Directing sump pump flow away from storm sewer systems is one method
for controlling increases of peak stormwater runoff, and thus controlling
future increases in stormwater damages. Many homeowners view sump pump
discharges as a nuisance and it can cause continual "wet spots" in a yard
making mowing difficult. In residential developments, these concerns must also
be addressed. However, redirecting sump pumps to sanitary sewers is prohibited
by water quality regulations.
      6.   To the extent practicable, drainage should be directed to and
through onsite storage swales. The swales should be vegetated with water-
tolerant species to prevent erosion and promote infiltration and pollutant
capture. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-5: REQUIRED DEDICATIONS:
9-5-5-1: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES:
School site dedications are required in compliance with Chapter 9-6 of the
Village Code. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-5-2: DEDICATION OF PARK SITES:
Park site dedications are required in compliance with Chapter 9-6 of the
Village Code. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-5-3: COMMON OPEN SPACE:
Residential subdivisions require that thirty five percent (35%) of the net
developable land area be set aside as common open space according to the
following standards.
   A.   The minimum open space required must be owned and managed as described
in this section. The uses within the open space must be accessible to all
residents of the development. These uses may also be available to the general
public. The required open space must be undivided and restricted in perpetuity
from future development.
   B.   The following active and passive open space uses are counted as common
open space:
      1.   Conservation area excluding natural water features and wetlands.
      2.   Water bodies, ponds, floodplain, or wetlands. However, no more than
fifteen percent (15%) of the total required common open space area may consist
of these areas.
      3.   Detention/retention areas accessible to occupants or the public via
nature trails, boardwalks, piers, or perimeter walkways. However, no more than
fifteen percent (15%) of the total required common open space area may consist
of these areas.
      4.   A trail system connecting open space areas. This includes hiking,
biking, and equestrian trails.
      5.   Recreational facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, and
skateparks. No more than thirty percent (30%) of the required total open space
area may consist of structures for recreational facilities.
      6.   Parks and playgrounds.
      7.   Greenways.
      8.   Botanical gardens, greenhouses, and community gardens.
      9.   Reuse of structures existing on the site prior to development for
community purposes (i.e. rehab of an existing barn or silo, etc.).
      10.   Agricultural uses, including vineyards with wineries and stables.
   C.   The following do not count toward common open space:
      1.   Yards on individual lots or yards that are reserved for the
exclusive use of an individual property owner.
      2.   Dedicated streets, alleys, or other public rights-of-way.
      3.   Vehicular drives, private streets, and parking, loading, and storage
areas.
      4.   Irrigation fields.
   D.   A management plan must be prepared and submitted for all common open
space, including any man-made drainage facilities that serve more than one
property, such as detention/retention ponds. The designated common open space
and common facilities must be owned and managed by one or a combination of the
following and the management plan must meet the standards for each type:
      1.   Homeowners Or Property Owners Association:
         a.   The developer must provide the Village with a description of the
association, proof of incorporation of the association, a copy of its bylaws,
and satisfactory proof of adoption thereof, a copy of the declaration of
covenants, easements, or restrictions or similar document(s) regulating the use
of the property and setting forth methods for maintaining the open space.
         b.   The association must be organized by the developer and operated
with financial subsidization from the developer before the sale of any lots
within the development.
         c.   Membership in the association is mandatory for all purchasers of
homes or lots therein and their successors. The conditions and timing of
transferring control of the association from developer to the homeowners must
be identified.
         d.   The association is responsible for maintenance and insurance on
open space owned by the association, enforceable by liens placed by the
homeowners' association. Maintenance obligations also may be enforced by the
Village, which may place liens to recover its costs. Any governmental body with
jurisdiction in the area where the development is located may place liens on
the owners of the open space to collect unpaid taxes.
         e.   The members of the association must share equitably the costs of
maintaining open space owned by the association. Shares must be defined within
the association bylaws or declaration. Association dues must be structured to
provide for both annual operating costs and to cover projected long-range costs
relating to the repair of any facilities and must be reserved for such
purposes.
         f.   The association must have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and to properly and continually maintain the open space.
         g.   The homeowners' or property owner's association may lease open
space lands to any other qualified person or corporation for operation and
maintenance of such lands, but such a lease agreement must provide:
            (1)   That the residents of the development and owners of the
property will at all times have access to the open space lands contained
therein (except that access to land that is actively farmed).
            (2)   That the open space lands to be leased must be maintained.
            (3)   That the operation of open space facilities may be for the
benefit of the residents only or may be open to the public, at the election of
the developer and/or homeowners' or property owners' association, as the case
may be.
         h.   Homeowners' or property owners' association documentation
approved by the Village demonstrating compliance with these provisions must be
recorded with the final subdivision, and proof of recording thereof must be
provided to the Village prior to the issuance of any building permits for the
property. At the time of preliminary plan submission, the applicant must
provide draft homeowners' association documentation with sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with this section.
      2.   Condominium Association: To the degree applicable, condominium
documents must comply with the regulations above for homeowners' associations.
Condominium documents must be recorded with the final plat. At the time of
preliminary plan submission, the applicant must provide draft condominium
documents with sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.
      3.   Private Conservation Organization: With the permission of the
Village, an owner may transfer either fee-simple title of the open space or
easements on the open space to a private, conservation organization recognized
by the township, among whose purposes it is to conserve open space and/or
natural resources, provided that:
         a.   The organization is acceptable to Village, and is a bona fide
conservation organization with perpetual existence.
         b.   The conveyance contains appropriate provision for proper reverter
or retransfer in the event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to
continue carrying out its functions.
         c.   The open space is permanently restricted from future development
through a conservation easement and the Village is given the ability to enforce
these restrictions.
         d.   A maintenance agreement acceptable to the Village is entered into
by the developer and the organization.
      4.   Private Ownership: An individual who will maintain the land for
common open space purposes, as provided by a conservation easement. This option
may be used only on a very limited basis for unique situations where no other
options are practical, as approved by the Village Board. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-
2020)
9-5-6: CONSERVATION DESIGN:
9-5-6-1: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Per Section 6.5 of the Zoning Ordinance, new development and
subdivisions located within the ESA Environmentally Sensitive Areas Overlay
District are required to undertake a conservation features inventory (CFI).
   B.   If the CFI indicates that twenty percent (20%) or more of the total
land area on-site contains significant natural resources, new residential
subdivisions must be designed as conservation design subdivisions per this
Section. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-6-2: INTENT:
Conservation design is intended to guide development so that it locates and
coordinates areas for development where the conservation of natural features is
prioritized, and provides common open space areas for passive and/or active
recreational use by residents of the development and, where appropriate, the
larger community. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-6-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Lots must be configured to minimize the loss of natural resources,
including wetlands, water bodies, woodlands, and historical resources. Lots may
be platted in a more irregular fashion than required by section
9-5-4-5 in order to achieve this purpose.
   B.   The development must preserve scenic natural views, including views
from roadways.
   C.   If agricultural uses are being maintained within the development, lots
must be configured in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for
such agricultural uses with appropriate buffers between agricultural uses and
residential structures. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-6-4: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Lots must be arranged in a manner that protects areas of conservation
value identified in the CFI.
   B.   Residential dwellings must be clustered according to the following
standards.
      1.   Each residential cluster is limited to no more than twenty five (25)
dwellings.
      2.   Residential clusters should be located a minimum of one hundred
fifty feet (150') apart lot line to lot line, separated by greenbelts or other
natural features. The greenbelts may include bike paths, hiking trails, or
equestrian trails, but no development is permitted within these separation
areas.
      3.   Residential clusters must be located to minimize negative impacts on
the natural, scenic, and cultural resources of the site.
      4.   Residential clusters must be sited to achieve the following goals:
         a.   Minimize disturbance to natural areas. Clear-cutting is
prohibited.
         b.   Prevent downstream impacts due to runoff through adequate on-site
stormwater management practices.
         c.   Protect scenic views of open land from adjacent roads to the
extent practical.
         d.    Whenever possible, fragmentation of woodland areas and other
natural ecosystems must be avoided. Contiguous swaths of undisturbed or
restored habitat should be preserved to create corridors for the movement of
wildlife and natural resources, and to promote biodiversity. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-
4-2020)
9-5-6-5: PERIMETER YARD:
There must be a perimeter buffer yard around the entire conservation design
development of no less than fifty feet (50'). No development is permitted in
this perimeter buffer yard, which must remain landscaped with no structures.
This perimeter buffer yard may be included in the required percentage of open
space if undivided and restricted in perpetuity from future development. Access
points to the development are permitted within this perimeter buffer yard.
(Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)
9-5-6-6: COMMON OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Fifty percent (50%) of the total land area in a conservation design
must be maintained as active or passive common open space. This controls over
any amount required by section
9-5-5-3.
   B.   The following active and passive open space uses are counted as common
open space for a conservation design, which controls over permissions allowed
by section
9-5-5-3:
      1.   Conservation of areas identified in the CFI.
      2.   Water bodies, ponds, floodplain, or wetlands.
      3.   Greenways.
      4.   Detention/retention areas accessible to occupants or the public via
nature trails, boardwalks, piers, or perimeter walkways. However, no more than
ten percent (10%) of the total required common open space area may consist of
these areas.
      5.   Agricultural uses.
      6.   No more than ten percent (10%) of the required total required open
space area may consist of the following, individually or cumulatively:
         a.   A trail system connecting open space areas, including hiking,
biking, and equestrian trails.
         b.   Parks and playgrounds.
         c.   Botanical gardens, greenhouses, and community gardens.
      7.   Reuse of structures existing on the site prior to development for
community purposes (i.e. rehab of an existing barn or silo, etc.).
   C.   Management of the common open space must meet the standards of section
9-5-5-3. (Ord. O-20-13, 11-4-2020)

9-6-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of
a planned development of property within the village and within the contiguous
unincorporated area within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the village, each
subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate land for school and park
purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
development, or shall be required to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual
land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village with
the concurrence of the affected district or districts (as to school donations),
which concurrence shall be obtained in writing. However, the village shall have
the final decision making power in this regard. School land dedication sites
shall be conveyed to the applicable district, and park land dedication sites
shall be conveyed to the village. The dedications and cash contributions
required hereunder shall be made in accordance with the criteria and formulas
of this chapter. (2013 Code § 9-2-1)
9-6-2: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATIONS:
   A.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be
generated by a subdivision or planned development shall bear directly on the
amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication
requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: 1) estimated
children to be generated by the development in each school classification
(elementary, junior high, and high school) over the 2) maximum recommended
number of students per building to be served in each such school classification
as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to 3) the appropriate number of
acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein.
The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient
land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of students for
each such school classification.
   B.   School Classifications And Size Of School Site:
      1.   These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available
data, studies and literature on the subject including, but not limited to,
information provided by the state superintendent of education, the school
districts located within the village and the unique characteristics of the
village, including its general rural character and open space, and the desire
of the residents to maintain this character and open space in future school
sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate
acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land
dedication herein, unless timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to
these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in
accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission. Failure to timely
object to these acreage requirements in accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
      2.   School classifications and size of school sites within the village
shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
   SCHOOL DISTRICTS 301, 302 AND 303
 
                           Maximum Number Of Students Appropriate Acres Of Land
                           For Each School            For Each School Site Of
                           Classification By Grades   Such Classification
Elementary schools, grades
kindergarten through fifth 600                        15
or sixth
Junior high schools,
grades sixth through       900                        35
seventh or eighth
High schools, grades ninth 1,500                      108
through twelfth
 
   C.   Location: The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by
the affected school district, if any, shall be used as a guideline in locating
sites. School sites shall be located in the village in accordance with plans
heretofore or hereafter adopted by the school district. If the school district
has not planned a school site within the village or the proposed subdivision or
planned development, or in the neighborhood in which such subdivision or
planned development is located, the school site shall be so located as to be
readily accessible to the greatest number of children projected for such
neighborhood. (2013 Code § 9-2-2)
9-6-3: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK AND RECREATIONAL LAND DEDICATIONS:
   A.   Suitability: The land for park and recreational dedications shall be
suitable for the purpose for which it is intended. Land set aside by developers
for parks, recreation and conservation purposes shall not be what has been
"left over" after residential, commercial and industrial development.
   B.   Requirement And Population Ratio:
      1.   The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly
on the amount of land required for dedication for park and recreational
purposes. The total requirement shall be ten and one-half (10.5) acres of land
per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population and may be allocated by the
village board at its discretion based upon the following criteria:
 
Type Of Recreation Area     Minimum Size      Park Acreage Per 1,000 Persons
Play lot                    8,000 square feet <1
Neighborhood park           3 acres           2
Villagewide park for active 10 acres          4
sports
Villagewide community park  15 acres          4
 
      2.   These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available
data studies and literature on the subject including, but not limited to, the
National Recreation And Park Association's "Recreation, Park And Open Space
Standards And Guidelines". These requirements shall be presumed as the
appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in
lieu of land dedication herein unless timely objected to as provided herein.
Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall
be made in accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission. Failure to timely
object to these acreage requirements in accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
   C.   Location: The park and recreation plans as adopted by the village
comprehensive plan shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central
location that will serve equally the entire development or a location that is
adjacent to an existing park and recreational land is most desirable. In large
developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according
to established standards for park area distances. (2013 Code § 9-2-3)
9-6-4: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING CASH CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF DEDICATIONS, OR
BOTH:
   A.   When the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be
practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for school or park and
recreational sites, or is in conflict with the approved comprehensive school
plan or village comprehensive plan, the village, with the concurrence of the
affected district, if appropriate, shall require the subdivider or developer to
pay to the village, for the benefit of the applicable school districts or for
the benefit of the village, as appropriate, a cash contribution in lieu of the
land dedication.
   B.   The cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites shall be
held in trust by the applicable school district and shall be used solely for
the acquisition of land for school sites to serve the immediate or future needs
of the district or for the expansion of any existing school site or
construction of school buildings or additions thereto.
   C.   If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of school sites is not
expended for the purposes set forth herein within thirteen (13) years from the
date of receipt, it shall be refunded by the school district holding the
contribution to the record owner of the subdivided land at the time of the
refund. If there is more than one record owner of the subdivided land or of the
land that comprises the planned development, as applicable, such record owners
shall share in the refund pro rata based on the cash contributions originally
paid by each property.
   D.   The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication
shall be held in trust by the village and shall be used solely for equipment,
improvements and the acquisition of park and recreation land as classified
above, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development or for the expansion of other
existing local park and recreation lands that already serve such needs or for
any other lawful park purpose.
   E.   The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the value of
the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as
school and/or park sites. The value, on a per acre basis, shall assume, unless
determined otherwise pursuant to this chapter, that the land is zoned in a one-
family dwelling residential zoning district, subdivided with appropriate
frontage on a dedicated street or road, has all appropriate utilities available
(including, where applicable, sanitary sewers provided by the spray field
system), is improved as set forth herein, and is otherwise property capable of
being used for residential development. Based upon a study of comparable real
estate transactions, it has been determined that the present value of such
improved land in and surrounding the village is, as of the effective date
hereof, as follows:
One hundred ninety five thousand dollars ($195,000.00) per acre for purposes of
locating an elementary school, junior high school or high school within the
applicable school districts and for park and recreational purpose.
The above figures shall be adjusted by the village board from time to time with
appropriate study and documentation. The value, as defined above, shall be used
in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless timely
objected to as provided in section
9-6-14 of this chapter. Objections to the value as defined above shall be made
in accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission. Failure to timely
object to the value, as defined above, in accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
   F.   There will be situations in subdivisions or planned developments when a
combination of land dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both
necessary. These occasions will arise when: 1) only a portion of the land to be
developed is proposed as the location for a school site (that portion of the
land within the subdivision falling within the school location shall be
dedicated as a site as stated above, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof
shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be
dedicated); or 2) a major part of the school site has already been acquired by
the particular district, and only a small portion of land is needed from the
development to complete the site (the remaining portion shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof for the rest of the
required land shall be required).
   G.   Each affected school district, or the village as to park and
recreational land, may, on a case by case basis, determine that the cash in
lieu of land to be dedicated would be of greater benefit to the district if
applied to the costs to educate the students generated by the development than
to the acquiring of land or to the capital repairs, improvements and expansion
of classroom and school facilities or the village for maintenance and/or other
operational expenses. In that event, the district or the village, as
applicable, may enter into a written agreement with said developer to accept
ninety five percent (95%) of the cash in lieu of the land requirement and
utilize those funds for operational expenses if the developer voluntarily
agrees to do so. Accordingly, the developer will receive a five percent (5%)
discount in exchange for granting the district the flexibility to utilize the
contribution for operational expenses. (2013 Code § 9-2-4)
9-6-5: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX:
The value identified in this chapter shall be subject to a "CPI adjustment"
which shall be calculated in January 2013 and in January of in each year
thereafter. Annually, the value per acre shall be adjusted to an amount equal
to the value per acre multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
"all items" consumer price index for urban consumers (1982-84 = 100) for
Chicago, Illinois, published by the United States department of labor's bureau
of labor statistics ("CPI") for the month of December preceding the year of
adjustment, and the denominator of which is the CPI for the month of December
preceding the month of adjustment. If any index is calculated from a base
different from the base period 1982-84 = 100, such index shall be converted to
a base period of 1982-84 = 100 by use of a conversion factor supplied by said
bureau of labor statistics. If the CPI is discontinued or replaced, such other
governmental cost of living index or computation which replaces the CPI shall
be used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained
if the CPI had not been discontinued or replaced. (2013 Code § 9-2-5)
9-6-6: DENSITY FORMULA:
   A.   The table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, prepared
by Illinois School Consulting Service/Ehlers, Inc., Naperville, Illinois, and
as updated from time to time by the consulting firm is contained in subsection
9-6-21C of this chapter. It constitutes projections of anticipated population
density and is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends
in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount
of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu
thereof, unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or
developer pursuant to section
9-6-14 of this chapter.
   B.   A "bedroom", as used in this section, shall mean any room, regardless
of its designation by the owner or permit applicant, which is suitable to be
used regularly as a room for sleeping including, but not limited to, dens,
studies, bonus rooms, libraries, television rooms, sewing rooms and similar
rooms (all of which are hereafter referred to as "extra rooms"), whether
finished or unfinished, located on the bedroom level of a multi-story
residence. Extra rooms located on the nonbedroom level of a multi-story
residence shall be considered bedrooms if there is a bath on that level
containing a shower or tub. Extra rooms in a single story residence shall
always be considered bedrooms.
   C.   The most recent version of the table of estimated ultimate population
per dwelling unit shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land
dedication herein unless objected to as provided in section
9-6-14 of this chapter. Objections to the table of estimated ultimate
population per dwelling unit shall be made in accordance with section
9-6-14 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission. Failure to object
to the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit in accordance
with section
9-6-14 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
   D.   In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the
table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit listed above, he shall
submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to
be generated from the subdivision or planned development, and in that event,
final determination of the density formula shall be made in accordance with
section
9-6-14 of this chapter. (2013 Code § 9-2-6)
9-6-7: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND:
When the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for larger
school sites in a particular subdivision or planned development than the
developer is required to dedicate pursuant to this chapter, the land needed
beyond the developer's dedication shall be set aside and reserved by the
developer for subsequent purchase by the school district (at a price determined
at the time of reservation); provided, that such acquisition is made within
five (5) years from the date of approval of the final plat. (2013 Code § 9-2-7)
9-6-8: COMBINING WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENTS:
Where appropriate, a school site or park and recreational land site that is to
be dedicated should, if possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining
developments in order to produce usable school sites or park and recreational
land sites without undue hardship on a particular developer. (2013 Code § 9-2-
8)
9-6-9: TOPOGRAPHY AND GRADING:
   A.   The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site, as well as its
surroundings, must be suitable for its intended purpose. Wetlands, floodplains,
detention areas, retention areas and areas of steep slopes shall not be
accepted as school sites and shall not serve as a credit toward the required
school site cash contribution in lieu of land dedication.
   B.   In addition, the following site conditions and preparation standards
shall be met:
      1.   Slope:
         a.   Should not vary greatly in appearance from existing and adjacent
slopes;
         b.   Optimum slopes range from two percent (2%) minimum to five
percent (5%) maximum. No less than two percent (2%) slope is acceptable under
any circumstances;
         c.   Maximum allowable slope is ten percent (10%), except under
special conditions where greater slopes are desirable to enhance the use of the
site; and
         d.   On site drainage patterns shall be designated and constructed to:
            (1)   Ensure flow toward swales; and
            (2)   Ensure drainage away from active areas.
      2.   Grading:
         a.   Rough grading shall be completed at the time of rough grading of
adjacent contiguous area;
         b.   Grading shall comply with village approved plans;
         c.   Subgrade shall be graded and compacted so it will parallel the
finished grade;
         d.   Subgrade material shall be loosened and fine graded to a depth of
two inches (2") to four inches (4"). All stones over four inches (4") in size,
sticks, debris, rubbish and other foreign substances shall be removed; and
         e.   Finished grades shall be uniform in slope between points for
which elevations have been established.
      3.   Soils:
         a.   Soils shall not differ from those naturally occurring;
         b.   Soils shall not offer any restriction to the ultimate use of the
property;
         c.   Topsoil shall be spread evenly and lightly compacted to a minimum
depth of six inches (6") over the entire site;
         d.   Topsoil must be good, friable soils with good tillage and shall
be without any mixture of subsoil, clay, gravel, stones, debris, refuse, sand
or other subsurface elements;
         e.   Topsoil shall not be placed in a muddy or frozen condition;
         f.   Topsoil shall contain no toxic substances which may be harmful to
plant growth; and
         g.   Topsoil shall be spread no later than the placement of topsoil on
the first lot adjacent to the site.
      4.   Seeding:
         a.   All proposed school sites shall be seeded and an acceptable stand
of grass or vegetation established prior to the dedication of the area to the
applicable school districts;
         b.   Seeding shall be completed during the fall or spring planting
times, depending upon the recommended seed planting specifications;
         c.   Seeding shall be on moderately dry soil on a seedbed which will
easily accept and nurture germination of seeds;
         d.   Seeding shall be watered sufficiently so that the vegetation
becomes reasonably established; and
         e.   The developer shall be responsible for making necessary
reparations to the site caused by erosion or other damage. Reparations shall be
completed prior to acceptance of the site. (2013 Code § 9-2-9)
9-6-10: IMPROVED SITES:
All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of
electricity, natural gas, telephone and cable television, and streets
(including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter, where applicable), as
applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the
requirements of the village ordinances and codes. Provided, that such
requirements may be waived in a specific case as to park and recreational land
sites, and the landscaping normally included within the definition of
"improved" sites under said ordinances and codes may be deleted due to the
delay time between dedication of any such school site and the construction of
school facilities thereon, except for ground cover as required in section
9-6-9 of this chapter. The site shall have direct access to a fully improved
street across at least twenty percent (20%) of the distance of its perimeter.
School sites should ideally be accessible by a bicycle/pedestrian trail, and
any such access route onto the property shall be at least twenty five feet
(25') wide. Such access routes should normally be dedications and not
easements, depending on which entity of government is to be responsible for
said routes. Any vehicular access route leading to or on the site shall be of
sufficient size and good geometry to properly accommodate vehicles that will
access and traverse the site including, but not limited to, good principles of
traffic circulation, accommodation of one-way and/or two-way drives for school
buses, separation of bus traffic from passenger automobile traffic, bus dropoff
areas separate from publicly dedicated streets, guest and employee parking
areas, and the like. Such off street access routes, drives, dropoffs and
parking areas will not be dedicated rights of way and shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the site to maintain. (2013 Code § 9-2-10)
9-6-11: ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AUDIT:
   A.   Prior to the conveyance of any land to the applicable school district
or the village, the intended grantee and the village shall be furnished with an
environmental risk audit prepared by an environmental professional meeting the
minimum requirements of 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii),
certified to and acceptable to the grantee, assuring the grantee that there are
no "hazardous substance(s)" (as defined in subsection E of this section) on,
under, to or from the land. Said environmental audit shall be what is commonly
referred to as a phase I environmental audit, which shall meet the minimum
requirements for a preacquisition audit as set forth in 415 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(v).
   B.   In the event the phase I environmental audit does not conclude there is
no presence or likely presence of a release or substantial threat of a release
of hazardous substance(s) or pesticide on, under, to or from the land, the
grantee shall furnish a phase II environmental audit as set forth in 415
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(vi), including a soil toxicity
analysis and recommendation from said environmental professional, meeting the
minimum requirements of 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii),
which concludes that there is no presence or likely presence of a release or
substantial threat of a release of hazardous substance(s) on, under, to or from
the land, and certifying that, in the judgment of said environmental
professional, there is no reasonable probability that the land contains any
hazardous substance(s) in violation of any federal or state environmental
standards.
   C.   In the event said phase II environmental audit and/or soil toxicity
analysis discloses the presence or likely presence of a release or a
substantial threat of a release of any hazardous substance(s) at, on, under, to
or from the land to the conveyed, the grantor shall first cause all such
hazardous substance(s) to be removed at its sole cost and expense in accordance
with all federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations and
furnish the intended grantee with a "no further remediation letter" from the
governmental agencies having jurisdiction over the cleanup prior to the
conveyance of any of the land to the intended grantee.
   D.   Prior to the conveyance of the land, the subdivider or developer, as
the case may be, and the owner of the land to be conveyed shall execute and
deliver to the intended grantee an environmental indemnification agreement,
which form has been approved by the village attorney, agreeing to defend,
indemnify and hold the village, its corporate authorities, officers, officials,
employees, agents, successors and assigns, and the school district, as the case
may be, and its respective officers, officials, employees, agents, successors
and assigns, harmless from and against any and all liability, claims, damages,
causes of action and expenses arising out of the presence of any hazardous
substance(s) in, under or upon said land to be conveyed prior to the date of
conveyance. (2013 Code § 9-2-11)

table (49 CFR 172.101, and amendments thereto) or by the environmental
protection agency (or any successor agency) as hazardous substances (40 CFR
part 302, and amendments thereto).
      3.   Such other substances, materials and wastes which are to become
regulated under applicable local, state or federal law, or which are classified
as hazardous or toxic under federal, state or local laws, ordinances or
regulations.
      4.   Any material waste or substance which is: a) asbestos; b)
polychlorinated biphenols; c) designated as a hazardous substance pursuant to
section 311 of the clean water act, 33 USC section 1251 et seq. (33 USC section
1321), or listed pursuant to section 307 of the clean water act (33 USC section

The subdivider or developer, at its own cost or expense, shall provide to the
village or school district soil boring data, soil compaction test results and
such other engineering studies, data and information pertaining to the proposed
school, which the village or school district may request to enable the
suitability of the proposed land dedication for school sites or park and
recreation purposes to be determined. The village or school district shall have
the right to reject any site which the village or school district determines,
in accordance with sound engineering practices, is not suitable for school site
purposes. (2013 Code § 9-2-12)
9-6-13: TITLE INSURANCE; SURVEY; ASSESSMENT PLATS; REAL ESTATE TAX ESCROW:
   A.   Each deed or other instrument conveying land to the village or school
district shall be accompanied by:
      1.   A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do
business in the state to insure the grantee's title to such real estate in an
amount equal to the value computed pursuant to section
9-6-2 of this chapter, with extended coverage over the general exceptions to
title and subject only to:
         a.   Real estate taxes not yet due and payable;
         b.   Covenants, conditions and restrictions which do not prohibit the
use of the subject property for school use;
         c.   Utility easements located within twenty feet (20') of the
boundary lines of the subject real estate (except where approved on the final
engineering plans approved by the village engineer);
         d.   Drainage ditches, feeders and laterals;
         e.   Underground pipe or other conduit; and
         f.   Acts done or suffered by or judgments against the grantees.
      2.   A current ALTA boundary line survey, certified to the grantee by a
licensed Illinois land surveyor to be in compliance with the "American Land
Survey Standards", showing no encroachments; and
      3.   Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed is a lot in
a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in a form
acceptable to the appropriate village authorities so the land to be conveyed
can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number (PIN) for exemption
purposes.
   B.   In addition, monuments must be established and the land staked
immediately prior to dedication of the property. The subdivider or developer
shall pay for the cost of the owner's title insurance in said amount, the ALTA
survey, the assessment plat and any and all costs in connection with the tax
division.
   C.   The developer shall pay the general real estate taxes on the land not
yet due and payable as of the date of transfer, and shall deposit a sum of
money in escrow with the intended grantee's attorney or a title company
licensed to do business in the state of Illinois, which is prorated as of the
date of transfer on the basis of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the tax
assessor's latest assessed valuation, the latest known equalization factors and
the latest known tax rate on the land. In the event the previous tax
information or the previous tax bill includes other property, then the amount
to be deposited in escrow shall be adjusted ratably based on the net acreage of
the land compared to the net acreage of the other parcels covered by said tax
bills. After the land has been divided for real estate tax purposes and has
been conveyed to the intended grantee, the grantee shall proceed with due
diligence to apply for a real estate tax exemption on the land. (2013 Code § 9-
2-13)
9-6-14: OBJECTIONS:
All objections relating to acreage requirements, school site requirements,
presumptions as to value, the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit or any other application of this chapter to a particular
subdivision or planned development shall first be referred to the planning and
zoning commission for a hearing. An objection must be made, if at all, prior to
the approval of the final plat of subdivision by the village. A failure to
object by such time shall constitute a waiver of the right to object to the
provisions of this chapter. The procedure for a hearing before the planning and
zoning commission shall be as follows:
   A.   Duties Of Planning and Zoning Commission: The planning and zoning
commission shall serve in an advisory capacity and shall have the following

and zoning commission in carrying out the duties imposed by this subsection.
   B.   Information And Services To Be Used: The village shall make available
to the planning and zoning commission all professional reports relating to the
table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, the size of the
school sites and the value of land used in calculating these cash
contributions. The planning and zoning commission may also retain the services
of professionals (attorneys, appraisers, statisticians, etc.) to assist in its
review of issues raised by any objection.
   C.   Procedure For Resolving An Objection:
      1.   Upon receipt of an objection, the village clerk shall place the same
on the next regular meeting agenda of the village board. Thereafter, the
village board shall refer the objection to the planning and zoning commission
which shall establish a hearing date.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission shall provide public notice of
the hearing date to consider the objection and shall notify the village board
and the affected school district by certified mail, return receipt requested,
or by electronic mail with proof of receipt, of the filing of the objection and
of any hearing regarding same.
      3.   The objector shall publish notice of the hearing date once each week
for three (3) consecutive weeks, at least thirty (30) days before, but no more
than sixty (60) days before, the scheduled date of the hearing. Notice shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the corporate limits of
the village. The notice of public hearing shall not appear in the part of the
paper where legal notices or classified ads appear. The notice shall not be
smaller than one-fourth (1/4) page of a standard size or tabloid size
newspaper. The objector shall send a copy of said notice to any person who has
requested said notice by certified mail (stamped at a U.S. postal service
facility showing the date of mailing) at least thirty (30) days prior to the
hearing date.
      4.   The notice shall contain all of the following information:
         a.   The heading shall read:
            NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING ON OBJECTION TO APPLICATION OF ORDINANCE
REQUIRING THE DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES AND PARK AND RECREATIONAL LAND OR
PAYMENT OF THE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN LIEU THEREOF.
         b.   The date, time and location of the public hearing.
         c.   A statement that the purpose of the hearing is to consider the
objection to a component of the application of this chapter requiring the
dedication of school sites or calculation of cash in lieu thereof.
         d.   A general description of the parcel(s), service area or areas
within the village that are the subject of the hearing.
         e.   A statement that the village shall make available to the public,
upon request, an easily understandable and detailed map of the parcel(s),
service area or areas to which this chapter applies, and any other available
information about the objection.
         f.   A statement that any member of the public affected by this

commission regarding the issues raised in the objection. The planning and
zoning commission shall make a recommendation to adopt, reject in whole or in
part, or modify the objection presented at the hearing, by written report to
the village, within sixty (60) days after the hearing. The village shall then
have at least sixty (60) but not more than one hundred twenty (120) days to
approve, disapprove or modify, by ordinance or resolution, the findings in this
chapter as it pertains to the development in question.
   D.   Costs And Fees: The objector shall bear all costs of the hearing before
the planning and zoning commission including, but not limited to, attendance
fees paid the planning and zoning commission members, publication costs,
professional consultants and any other expenses of the village. Failure to
promptly pay costs which are billed shall be cause, at the option of the
village, to stay or defer any hearings, meetings or actions by the village.
(2013 Code § 9-2-14)
9-6-15: ANNEXATION OF LAND:
   A.   The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof required
by this chapter shall also be required as a condition to the annexation of any
land to the village, and provisions therefor shall, at a minimum, be
incorporated in any annexation or preannexation agreement governing such land.
However, the village reserves the right to negotiate dedications of land or
cash contributions in lieu of land or a combination thereof greater than those
set forth herein.
   B.   The village recognizes the fact that developments may differ in their
impact upon a community. Consequently, the village reserves the right to
negotiate dedications that are different from those contained in this chapter
when annexing property to the village pursuant to an annexation agreement.
(2013 Code § 9-2-15)
9-6-16: INDEMNIFICATION:
As a condition to the village distributing land dedications and/or cash
contributions in lieu thereof, the appropriate district shall execute an
indemnification agreement in the form set forth in subsection
9-6-21A of this chapter. (2013 Code § 9-2-16)
9-6-17: DISTRIBUTION:
The cash contribution in lieu of land dedication imposed by this chapter shall
be collected and held by the benefiting district or the village, as applicable,
to be used for the purposes set forth in this chapter. As a condition of
distribution of these land dedications and/or cash contributions in lieu of
land dedications, the village shall require that the school district benefiting
from such land dedications and/or cash contributions provide a needs assessment
and a plan for acquisition of land and capital facilities. (2013 Code § 9-2-17)
9-6-18: NEEDS ASSESSMENT; LAND AND CAPITAL FACILITIES ACQUISITION PLAN:
   A.   A needs assessment shall contain the following information for each
benefiting district:
      1.   A description of the nature and location of existing school and
existing capital facilities within each district.
      2.   An identification of the capacity of each site within the particular
district and of the number of students then enrolled in each school building.
      3.   A projection of the character and location of new development that
is expected to occur within each district or village during the succeeding ten
(10) year period. The district or village may obtain the information necessary
to make this projection from sources such as, but not limited to:
municipalities, other units of government, agencies and consultants.
      4.   An identification of the amount of lands that will be necessary
within the school district and village in order to accommodate the demands of
such projected new development, and an estimate of the public grounds
acquisition costs that will be incurred or have been incurred by each district
in acquiring such lands.
      5.   A general description of each classification of capital facilities
(including construction, expansion or enhancement of any public facilities and
the land improvement, design, engineering and professional costs related
thereto) that will be necessary within each district in order to provide
adequate capacity for the projected new development, and an estimate of the
capital facilities costs that will be incurred by each district in constructing
such capital facilities.
   B.   Based upon the needs assessment, the school district shall provide the
village an acquisition plan for lands and capital facilities. This acquisition
plan shall:
      1.   Project for a planning period of at least five (5) years, the need
for lands and capital facilities within the district or village.
      2.   Set forth a schedule for the acquisition of such lands and
facilities to meet the projected need in general and specifically within the
village in the next five (5) years (which schedule may be conditioned upon the
availability of financing).
      3.   Indicate the size and general location of the needed lands and
facilities.
      4.   Identify the estimated or incurred costs of acquiring such needed
lands and facilities.
      5.   Set forth the anticipated funding sources for the acquisition of
such needed lands and facilities.
      6.   Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed lands and
facilities based upon the district's current financial condition.
      7.   Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed lands and
facilities based upon the district or village estimate of the revenues
(including, without limitation, cash in lieu of land dedication required by
this section) pursuant to the plan.
      8.   The impact on property taxes in the village assuming the plan is
implemented.
   C.   If the village deems it necessary, it may require an updated needs
assessment and plan for acquisition of land and capital facilities from the
district annually. The failure to require said assessment update shall not
invalidate the requirements of this section. (2013 Code § 9-2-18)
9-6-19: TIME OF PAYMENT:
   A.   All land dedications and cash contributions imposed by this chapter
shall be due and payable upon final plat approval. However, the village may
agree that the payment of the cash contributions may be made at the time of
building permit issuance in consideration of which the subdivider or developer
shall execute an agreement, as set out in subsection
9-6-21B of this chapter, agreeing that the cash contributions payable will be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements herein and further agreeing that
the cash contributions may be expended for the purposes described in subsection
9-6-21B of this chapter.
   B.   In calculating the land dedications and cash contributions at the time
of platting, the village will assume the maximum density permitted under the
zoning classification approved pursuant to the table set forth in subsection
9-6-21C of this chapter. However, if the subdivision in question is zoned
single-family, the village will assume, for purposes of calculating fees
payable pursuant to this chapter, that all houses will have four (4) bedrooms
(in recognition of the fact that experience and studies have demonstrated that
5 bedroom homes have a lesser financial impact on the school districts than 4
bedroom homes). The village will then hold sufficient funds pending issuance of
the building permit to enable it to refund any overpayments resulting from the
fact that houses with other than four (4) bedrooms are constructed. Refunds
shall be made at the time of issuance of the building permit.
In the event the village agrees to delay the payment of the fees required under
this section to the time of building permit issuance, the cash contributions
owed shall be based upon this chapter or as provided in such future ordinances
amending or replacing this chapter which are in effect at the time the building
permit is issued. (2013 Code § 9-2-19)
9-6-20: CALCULATING CASH CONTRIBUTIONS:
In calculating any cash contributions in lieu of land dedication payable at
time of issuance of building permit as provided in this chapter, the village
shall use the values as set forth in section
9-6-2 of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, and in effect at the time of
the contribution and building permit issuance. (2013 Code § 9-2-20)

AGREEMENT REGARDING THE RECEIPT OF DEVELOPER SUBDIVISION
CONTRIBUTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
WHEREAS, the Village of Campton Hills, Kane County, Illinois, on behalf of
itself, its officers, employees and independent contractors (the "Village"),
through its ordinances or through the provisions of its annexation agreements
has required that developers make contributions to the Village, that the
Village, in turn, may make these contributions available for itself and/or for
other governmental bodies that are affected by the subdivision improvements;
and
WHEREAS, such contributions may be in land or in money and, when transferred or
paid over to those government bodies, inure in part to the benefit of those
government bodies and not entirely to the direct benefit of the Village; and
WHEREAS, from time to time within the Village, and within other municipalities,
disputes have arisen regarding the validity and amount of such contributions;
and
WHEREAS, the Village is willing, at its discretion, to continue seeking the
contribution of land or money but wishes to procure a commitment from other
government bodies benefited by the receipt of such contributions that those
government bodies will (a) acknowledge that the requirement that such
subdivision contributions be made are totally within the discretion of the
Village as to their existence, manner and amount; (b) pay the cost of defending
any lawsuit that is filed challenging the appropriate amount of the
contributions, the time at which they are to be made or any other aspect of the
contributions; and (c) comply with the terms of a final and nonappealable
judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction rendered in
connection with the lawsuit; and
WHEREAS, the Village is willing, in its discretion, to pay over or require
contributions only to other government bodies that execute this agreement
("Agreement");
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the payment of money or the transfer of
the land to the Benefiting Government, which the Village from time to time may,
within its discretion, cause to be made by developers that are subdividing
property, it is agreed between the Village, on behalf of itself and its
officers, employees and independent contractors, and a government body within
the state of Illinois (the "Benefiting Government"), as follows:
   1.    The Benefiting Government acknowledges that, except as otherwise
provided in the Village's ordinances and/or annexation agreements, the Village
is not obligated to cause the payment of money or the transfer of land to the
Benefiting Government. The Benefiting Government recognizes that the Village
may, at its sole discretion, amend its ordinances or annexation agreements or
its practices to discontinue the payment of subdivision contributions to the
Benefiting Government.
   2.    Legal Representation
      A.    In the event a lawsuit is filed against the Village, the Benefiting
Government, and/or others by a developer that is subdividing property or any
other person, corporation or entity that challenges the appropriateness,
amount, timing or any other aspect of a subdivision contribution that, pursuant
to the terms of the Village's ordinances or annexation agreements, has been
paid or is due to the Benefiting Government, then the Benefiting Government
does agree to pay the costs and litigation expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Village in defending such lawsuit. The costs
and expenses shall be paid by the Benefiting Government when and as incurred by
the Village but in no event more than once a month. As a condition precedent to
the payment of these costs and expenses, the Village shall submit to the
Benefiting Government copies of the original statements reflecting the costs
and expenses, together with the non-privileged supporting documentation that
may be reasonably requested by the Benefiting Government.
      B.    The Village covenants and agrees that it shall employ competent and
skilled legal counsel to represent the Benefiting Government and the Village,
and further covenants and agrees that it shall keep the Benefiting Government
fully advised as to the progress and status of the litigation. In particular,
the Village shall provide to the Benefiting Government copies of all pleadings
filed in the litigation and shall consult regularly (and shall cause its
attorneys to consult regularly) with the Benefiting Government or its
attorneys, as applicable, as to the strategy for defending the lawsuit. In no
event may such litigation be compromised or settled by the Village without at
least 30 days' prior written notice to the Benefiting Government.
      C.    In the event that the Benefiting Government decides that it would
prefer to be represented in the litigation by legal counsel of its own
choosing, then the Benefiting Government shall be free to retain its own legal
counsel for that purpose and to intervene in the litigation and to ask the
Village to terminate its representation of the Benefiting Government under this
Agreement. The Benefiting Government shall notify the Village, in writing, to
that effect. In that event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect regarding all of the provisions of this Agreement, and the Benefiting
Government shall remain liable to the Village for all sums that have accrued
under this agreement up until the date that such written notice is received and
for all sums that remain due and owing from the Benefiting Government to the
Village relating to the defense of any lawsuit under the terms of this
Agreement.
   3.    The Benefiting Government shall further indemnify and hold harmless
the Village from any and all liability arising from the Subdivision Code of the
Village, including but not limited to, the general administration and handling
of funds required by the Village and the Benefiting Government.
   4.    In the event that a final and non-appealable judicial determination is
made by a court of competent jurisdiction that contributions of land or money
received by the Benefiting Government are, in whole or in part, excessive, the
Benefiting Government shall promptly repay those contributions to the person
who procures such a judgment, together with all other amounts judged by the
court to be owing from the Benefiting Government. In the event a judicial
determination should require the payment of damages or payment of the
attorneys' fees of the plaintiff's attorneys, the Benefiting Government shall
pay all additional amounts.
   5.    In further consideration of the continued payment by the Village to
the Benefiting Government of the subject contributions of land or money, the
Benefiting Government agrees that its obligations under this Agreement shall
extend to both past and future cash and land contributions.
   6.    On or before June 1st of each year, every Benefiting Government that
receives payments from the Village under this Agreement shall submit a report
to the Village describing the manner in which the payments have been used and
provide any additional information the Village may require. When that money
turned over to the Benefiting Government is to be used for a specific purpose
or within a specific time period, the report shall address those issues. If the
Benefiting Government should fail to file such a report with the Village, the
Village may delay the payment of any additional funds due the Benefiting
Government until such time as a full report containing adequate information is
transmitted to the Village. The Benefiting Government understands that it will
be asked to execute an indemnity agreement similar to this Agreement on an
annual basis and that the Village shall not pay any additional funds due to the
Benefiting Government until such time as the Village is in receipt of such
annually executed indemnity agreement.
   7.    This Agreement shall be terminable by either party for any reason or
no reason at all upon 30 days' prior written notice to the other party
evidencing the intention to so terminate this Agreement. But the termination of
this Agreement shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Benefiting
Government or the Village with regard to claims or damages allegedly arising
out of the Village's efforts prior to termination to impose, collect or
distribute contributions, or to the actual distribution of subdivision
contributions.

dwelling unit basis at the time the Village issues a building permit for the
particular dwelling unit.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration for the Village agreeing to delay its receipt
of the cash contributions, Developer hereby agrees as follows:
   1.    The amount of cash contributions owed shall be calculated based upon
the present provisions of the Village Code or as provided for in such other
future provisions amending or replacing the Code provisions which are in effect
at the time of the issuance of a building permit.
   2.    Notwithstanding any present or future law, regulation and/or legal
precedent to the contrary, the unit of local government that is the ultimate
recipient of the subject cash contributions may expend such contributions for
any of the following purposes intended to serve immediate or future needs of
the residents and children of the Developer's subdivision or planned
development: (a) for the acquisition of land; (b) for site improvements such
as, by way of example, streets, curbs, gutters, stormwater control, and utility
extensions; (c) for construction of capital facilities, including, by way of
example, new buildings and structures, and the expansion or enhancement of
existing buildings and structures; and (d) for so-called soft costs directly
related to the foregoing items (b) or (c) such as architectural and engineering
costs.
   3.    Developer has reviewed sections of the Village Code regarding the
dedication of school sites or cash contributions in lieu thereof, as well as
all of the methodology, formulae, calculations, projections, assumptions,
numbers and other factors used to arrive at the land dedication requirements or
cash contributions in lieu thereof that are the subject of this Agreement
(hereinafter referred to as the "Code and Attendant Calculations") and hereby
acknowledges and agrees that:
      (a)    Pursuant to the terms of the Code, Developer has been offered the
opportunity to raise in a hearing before the Village, any objections relating
to acreage requirements, presumptions as to value, the Table of Estimated
Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, or any other application of the Code;
Developer has not raised such objections; Developer has thereby waived the
right to assert those objections.
      (b)    Developer hereby waives any future right to object to or to
institute any legal action regarding Code and Attendant Calculations.
      (c)    Developer hereby acknowledges that Code and Attendant Calculations
have been properly passed, calculated and imposed.
   4.    This Agreement constitutes a covenant that is appurtenant to and runs
with the Land. Either this Agreement or a memorandum thereof may be recorded
against legal title to the Land by either party hereto; provided, however, it
shall be a condition of the Village's issuance of the first building permit for
a dwelling unit on the Land that Developer shall provide satisfactory evidence
to the Village that this Agreement or a memorandum thereof has been recorded
against legal title to the Land.
   5.    Developer represents and warrants to the Village that it is the sole
holder of record fee title to the Land.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Village and the developer have caused this agreement to
be duly authorized, executed and entered into as of the day of

special use prior to the effective date of this title or any subsequent
amendment to this title, and that use is now classified as a permitted use as
of the effective date of this title or any subsequent amendment to this title,
that use is classified as a permitted use. The use is no longer subject to any
conditions placed upon its approval; however, the continued operation and/or
any subsequent addition, enlargement, or expansion of that use must conform to
all Ordinance requirements for such use.
      5.   Any structure or land used in a manner that was classified as either
a permitted use or special use prior to the effective date of this title or any
subsequent amendment to this title, but this title no longer allows that use as
either a permitted or special use in the zoning district in which it is
located, that use is classified a nonconforming use.
   B.   Structures rendered nonconforming. If a structure existing on the
effective date of this title was a conforming structure before the effective
date of this title or any subsequent amendment to this title, but such
structure does not meet all standards set forth in this title in the zoning
district in which it is located, that structure is deemed a nonconforming
structure.
   C.   Lots rendered nonconforming. If a lot existing on the effective date of
this title was a conforming lot of record before the effective date of this
title or any subsequent amendment to this title, but such lot does not meet all
standards set forth in this title in the zoning district in which it is
located, that lot is deemed a nonconforming lot.
   D.   Site elements rendered nonconforming. If a site element existing on the
effective date of this title was conforming before the effective date of this
title or any subsequent amendment to this title, but such site element does not
meet all standards set forth in this title in the zoning district in which it
is located, that site element is deemed a nonconforming site element.
   E.   Previously issued building permits. If a building permit for a
structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this title, or any
subsequent amendment to this title, and if construction has begun within ninety
(90) days of the issuance of that permit, the structure may be completed in
accordance with the plans on the basis of which the building permit was issued
and may, upon completion, be occupied for the use originally intended.
   F.   Previously granted variances. All variance approvals granted prior to
the effective date of this title, or any subsequent amendment to this title,
remain in full force and effect. The recipient of the variance may proceed to
develop the property in accordance with the approved plans and all applicable
conditions.
   G.   Existing planned unit developments. Previously approved planned unit
developments (PUD) remain in effect and continue to control the development of
land that is subject to the PUD. Any amendments to existing PUDs are subject to
the amendment procedures of this title.
   H.   Pending applications. A building permit application or a zoning
application that has been received and deemed complete by the Zoning Officer is
subject to the rules in effect on the date the application was deemed complete.
   I.   Existing unlawful uses. Any use that was unlawful at the time of the
adoption of this title that is in conflict with the requirements of this title
remains unlawful. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-1-5:   SEVERABILITY:
If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision of this
title is adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, that
judgment does not affect, impair, invalidate, or nullify the remainder of this
title. The effect of the judgment is confined to the section, paragraph,
subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision immediately involved in the
controversy in which judgment or decree was rendered. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)

10-3-1:   APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Filing, pre-application conference, and referrals.
      1.   All zoning applications shall be filed with the Zoning Officer. The
application shall be on forms provided by the Village and filed in such
quantity as required by the instructions.
      2.   Prior to formal submittal of an application, the applicant may
request a pre-application conference with the Zoning Officer. The purpose of a
pre-application conference, which requires neither application nor fees, is to
provide informal advice and assistance to the applicant. Any opinions or advice
provided are not binding with respect to any official action that may be taken
on the formal application.
      3.   Prior to final decisions on the applications of this chapter, during
the review and recommendation process, the application may be referred to the
applicable fire district, applicable school district, Kane County Department of
Transportation, Illinois Department of Transportation, and/or other
governmental authorities or their consultants for review and comment.
   B.   Completeness.
      1.   An application must include all information, plans, and data as
specified in the application requirements. Any required plans must be at a
scale sufficient to permit a clear and precise understanding of the proposal,
unless specifically required to be at a set scale.
      2.   The Zoning Officer will examine all applications within thirty (30)
days of filing to determine their completeness, which time may be reasonably
extended by the Zoning Officer upon notice to the applicant. If the application
does not include all the submittal requirements for the application, the Zoning
Officer will reject the application and provide the applicant with the reasons
for the rejection. The Zoning Officer will take no further steps to process the
application until all deficiencies are remedied.
      3.   After an application is determined to be complete, any substantive
change made by the applicant to the application requires resubmittal of the
entire application and a new completeness review. However, such revisions do
not require an additional payment of fees.
      4.   Once the application is under consideration by the appropriate body,
additional information, or revisions are not subject to this provision.
   C.   Fees and Escrow. Each application must be accompanied by the required
filing fee and/or escrow money as established and modified, from time to time,
in the Village Code. The failure to pay such fee when due is grounds for
refusing to process the application and renders the application incomplete.
   D.   Withdrawal of applications. An applicant has the right to withdraw an
application at any time prior to the final decision on the application by a
board or official, including the ability to withdraw the application if it has
been tabled by a board or official. The applicant must submit a request for
withdrawal in writing. There will be no refund of fees. Any unused escrow money
shall be refunded by the Village.
   E.   Consideration of successive applications.
      1.   If an application is denied, a subsequent application for the same
zoning approval will not be reviewed or heard within one (1) year of the date
of denial unless the applicant can show there is substantial new evidence
available or that changed circumstances exist.
      2.   If the application is resubmitted earlier than one year from the
date of denial, the subsequent application must include a detailed statement of
the grounds justifying its consideration. The Zoning Officer will make a
determination as to whether the subsequent application is appropriate for
consideration prior to the expiration of the one (1)-year period. If the Zoning
Officer finds that there are no new grounds for consideration of the subsequent
application, he/she shall deny the request. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2022)
10-3-2:   PUBLIC NOTICE:
   A.   Required notice. The types of public notices required for zoning
applications are indicated with an “x” in Table 3-1 below.
   B.   Publication in newspaper. When publication in a newspaper is required,
the Zoning Officer will cause to be published a notice in a newspaper of
general circulation within the Village. The notice must include the date, time,
venue and purpose of such hearing, and the address and Parcel Identification
Number (PIN) of the subject property. Notice must be published no less than
fifteen (15) days and no more than thirty (30) days in advance of the scheduled
hearing date.

than fifteen (15) and no more than thirty (30) days in advance of the scheduled
hearing date to all property owners within two hundred and fifty feet (250') of
all property lines of the subject property. When measuring from a property line
abutting a right-of-way, measurement is taken from the right-of-way line on the
farthest side of the right-of-way from the property. The Zoning Officer shall
provide the applicant with the text of the notice to be mailed and a list of
property owners and their addresses to whom the notice shall be mailed.
      1.   The notice must include the date, time, venue, and purpose of such
hearing, the address and PIN of the subject property. When a zoning map
amendment is proposed by the Village, notification shall also be mailed to the
owner of the subject property.
      2.   Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the applicant or the
Village from giving additional notice as he/she may deem appropriate.
      3.   The applicant is responsible for providing mailing material and
postage costs. Following completion of the mailing, the applicant shall return
to the Zoning Officer a signed affidavit, as provided by the Village,
indicating compliance with the mailing requirements.
   E.   Sign notice. When sign notice is required, the sign shall be located on
the subject property in accordance with the following provisions:
      1.   The required posting period must be no less than fifteen (15) days
and no more than thirty (30) days in advance of the scheduled hearing date. The
sign must be posted at a prominent location on the property, near the sidewalk
or public or private right-of-way, so that it is visible to pedestrians and
motorists. Properties with more than one street frontage are required to post
one sign visible on each street frontage. Posted signs may be removed the day
following the scheduled hearing date.
      2.   Posted signs shall contain the following information: date, time and
venue of hearing. Additionally, the sign shall state:
         “A public hearing regarding a zoning application is scheduled on this
property before the Planning and Zoning Commission/Planning and Zoning
Commission on [insert date] at [insert time] at [insert venue]. For more
information call the Village of Campton Hills at [insert number].”
      The sign shall be a minimum of three by four feet (3' x 4') in size, and
shall have a white background with black block letters at least one and a half
inches (1.5") in height. The phrase “NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING” shall be in
three-inch (3") high red capital block letters.
      3.   The Zoning Officer shall draft the text for sign, and forward to the
applicant the text and the sign guidelines as specified in sub-paragraphs 1 and
2 above. It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to ensure the creation and
proper installation of the public notice sign. The applicant shall bear cost of
sign production. The Zoning Officer or other Village staff shall verify timely
placement of the sign and that the sign was installed in a proper location.
(Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2022)
10-3-3:   ZONING TEXT AND MAP AMENDMENTS:
   A.   Purpose. The regulations imposed and the districts created by this
title may be amended from time to time in accordance with this chapter. This
process for amending the Zoning Ordinance text or the Zoning Map is intended to
allow modifications in response to omissions or errors, changed conditions, or
changes in Village policy. Amendments are not intended to relieve particular
hardships or confer special privileges or rights upon any person or party.
   B.   Initiation. The Village Board, the Planning and Zoning Commission, or a
property owner in the Village, or his/her designee, may propose a zoning text
amendment. The Village Board or the Planning and Zoning Commission may propose
zoning map amendments. Additionally, the owner of a property may propose a
zoning map amendment for his/her property.
   C.   Authority. The Village Board, after receiving a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, will take formal action on requests for zoning
text or map amendments.
   D.   Procedure. All applications must be filed with the Zoning Officer. Once
it is determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Officer will
schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Amendments initiated by the Village Board or the Planning and
Zoning Commission also require an application, but are exempt from fees.
      1.   Action by Planning and Zoning Commission.
         a.   Within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application,
unless an extension of time is agreed to by the applicant and the Zoning
Officer, the Planning and Zoning Commission will consider the proposed zoning
amendment at a public hearing.
         b.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate the application
based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to the
approval standards of this section. For zoning text amendments, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval, approval with modifications, or
denial of the application. For zoning map amendments, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the application.
         c.   Within sixty (60) days of the close of the public hearing, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the Village
Board, unless an extension is agreed to by the applicant and the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
      2.   Action by Village Board. The Village Board will review the
application within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning
Commission recommendation, unless an extension of time is agreed to by the
applicant and the Village Board. The Village Board must take action in the form
of approval, approval with modifications, or denial on applications for zoning
text amendments, and approval or denial on applications for zoning map
amendments.
   E.   Approval Standards. The Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation
and the Village Board decision on any zoning text or map amendment is a matter
of legislative discretion that is not controlled by any particular standard.
However, in making their recommendation and decision, the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the Village Board shall consider the following standards. The
approval of amendments is based on a balancing of these standards; adherence or
conformance to all standards is not necessary.
      1.   Approval Standards for Map Amendments:
         a.   The compatibility with the existing use and zoning of nearby
property.
         b.   The extent to which the proposed amendment promotes the public
health, safety, and welfare of the Village.
         c.   The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship
imposed upon the applicant.
         d.   The suitability of the property for the purposes for which it is
presently zoned, i.e., the feasibility of developing the property in question
for one or more of the uses permitted under the existing zoning classification.
         e.   The length of time that the property in question has been vacant,
as presently zoned, considered in the context of development in the area where
the property is located.
         f.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the Comprehensive
Plan and any adopted land use policies.
         g.   That the proposed amendment will benefit the residents of the
Village as a whole, and not serve solely the interest of the applicant.
         h.   The extent to which the proposed amendment creates or eliminates
nonconformities.
         i.   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question.
         j.   Whether adequate public facilities are available including, but
not limited to, schools, parks, police and fire protection, roads, sanitary
sewers, storm sewers, and water lines, or are reasonably capable of being
provided prior to the development of the uses, which would be permitted on the
subject property if the amendment were adopted.
      2.   Approval Standards for Text Amendments:
         a.   The extent to which the proposed amendment promotes the public
health, safety, and welfare of the Village.
         b.   The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship
imposed upon the applicant.
         c.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the Comprehensive
Plan and whether the proposed amendment provides a more workable way to achieve
the intent and purposes of this title and the Comprehensive Plan.
         d.   The consistency of the proposed amendment with the intent and
general regulations of this title.
         e.   Whether the proposed amendment corrects an error or omission,
adds clarification to existing requirements, or reflects a change in policy.
         f.   The extent to which the proposed amendment creates
nonconformities.
         g.   The extent to which the proposed amendment is consistent with the
overall structure and organization of this title.
   F.   Written Protest of Amendment. Written protest of an amendment may be
filed and will be processed and considered in accordance with Illinois State
Statute. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2022)
10-3-4:   SPECIAL USES:
   A.   Purpose. This title is based upon the division of the Village into
zoning districts. Within each zoning district the uses of land and structures
are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain
uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in a particular district or districts without consideration of the
impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the
particular use at the particular location.
   B.   Initiation. A property owner in the Village, or his/her designee, may
file an application to use his/her land for one or more of the special uses
authorized within the zoning district. A property owner, or his/her designee,
may only propose a special use for property under his/her control.
   C.   Authority. The Village Board, after receiving a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, will take formal action on special use
applications.
   D.   Procedure. An application for a special use must be filed with the
Zoning Officer. Once it is determined that the application is complete, the
Zoning Officer will schedule the application for consideration by the Planning
and Zoning Commission.
      1.   Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission:
         a.   Within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application,
unless an extension of time is agreed to by the applicant and the Zoning
Officer, the Commission will consider the special use at a public hearing.
         b.   The Planning and Zoning Commission must evaluate the application
based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to the
approval standards of this section. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
recommend either approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the special
use.
         c.   Within sixty (60) days of the close of the public hearing, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the Village
Board, unless an extension is agreed to by the applicant. The recommendation
shall be accompanied by findings.
      2.   Action by Village Board. The Village Board shall act on the special
use within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning Commission
recommendation. The Village Board shall approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the special use. Any approval shall be accompanied by findings.
      3.   Conditions on Special Uses. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend, and the Village Board may impose, such conditions and restrictions
upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of
the special use as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the public
health, safety, and welfare. The Village Board may require such guarantees, as
it may deem necessary, to assure compliance with any stipulated conditions.
      4.   Approval Runs with Property. Special use approval shall be granted
for the property rather than the applicant, unless the Village Board, in
approving the special use ordinance, grants the special use approval to the
applicant. In such instances, the applicant shall not transfer the special use
to a new property without a new application and public hearing.
   E.   Approval standards. The listing of a use as a special use within a
zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such
special use will be approved. Rather, each special use application must be
evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to all applicable standards of
this title. Such an evaluation will determine whether approval of the special
use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner
proposed. The recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission will be
accompanied by findings to support each of the following conclusions, which the
Village Board will consider in its decision:
      1.   The proposed special use will not endanger the public health,
safety, or welfare.
      2.   The proposed special use is compatible with the general land use of
adjacent properties and other property within the immediate vicinity.
      3.   The special use in the specific location proposed is consistent with
the spirit and intent of this title and adopted Village land use policies.
   F.   Modifications to approved special uses. Any amendment to an approved
special use permit must follow the application, hearing, and approval process
required for a new special use permit.
   G.   Expiration. A special use approval expires if any one of the following
conditions occurs and no request for an extension of the special use approval
is pending.
      1.   When an approved special use is changed to another use.
      2.   For special uses approved in conjunction with new construction or
additions or enlargements to an existing structure, the special use approval
expires within one (1) year of the date of approval if a building permit has
not been issued.
      3.   For special uses approved in conjunction with an existing structure
or on lot where no structure is planned, the special use approval expires
within one (1) year of the date of approval if the licenses or permits required
for the operation or maintenance of the use have not been obtained.
      4.   For special uses approved in conjunction with a preliminary plan for
a planned unit development, the special use approval expires in conjunction
with the preliminary plan expiration.
      5.   When the special use has been abandoned or has ceased operation for
one (1) year or more. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2022)
10-3-5:   VARIATIONS:
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of the variation process is to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief from the strict adherence to this title may
be granted from unforeseen applications of this title that create practical
difficulties or particular hardships.
   B.   Initiation. Any owner of property, or the designee of the property
owner, may file an application for a variation for the specific property owned.
   C.   Authority. The Village Board, after receiving a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, will take formal action on variations.
   D.   Procedure. All applications must be filed with the Zoning Officer. Once
it is determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Officer will
schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
      1.   Within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application, unless
an extension of time is agreed to by the applicant and the Zoning Officer, the
Planning and Zoning Commission will consider the variation at a public hearing.
      2.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate the application
based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to the
approval standards of this section. The Commission must recommend either
approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the variation.
      3.   Within sixty (60) days of the close of the public hearing, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the Village
Board, unless an extension is agreed to by the applicant. The recommendation
shall be accompanied by findings.
      4.   The Village Board shall act on the variation within sixty (60) days
of receipt of the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation. The Village
Board shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the variation request.
Any approval shall be accompanied by findings.
   E.   Conditions.
      1.   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village
Board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the variation as may be
deemed necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare.
      2.   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village
Board may grant a variation that is less than that requested when it has been
decided that the applicant is entitled to some relief of the hardship, but not
to the entire relief requested in the variation application.
   F.   Approval standards. The recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission must make findings to support the following conclusions, which the
Village Board will consider in its decision:
      1.   The strict application of the terms of this title will result in
undue hardship unless the specific relief requested is granted.
      2.   The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property impose a particular hardship upon the
owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulations were to be carried out.
      3.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances inherent to
the subject property and not from the personal situation of the owner and has
not been created by any person presently having a proprietary interest in the
property in question.
   G.   Expiration of variation. An approved variation will expire one year
from the date of approval unless a building permit is obtained or applied for
within such period. The Village Board may grant an extension to the one (1)-
year expiration period, so long as the applicant applies in writing for an
extension of time at any time prior to the date of expiration. No public
hearing is required for approval of such an extension of time. (Ord. O-24-22,
12-3-2022)
10-3-6:   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   Purpose. Planned unit developments (PUD) are allowed as a distinct
category of special use. In particular the planned unit development technique
is intended to encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of
land than is possible under district zoning regulations and should only be
applied to further those applications that provide compensating amenities to
the Village. The underlying zoning district’s standards apply to a PUD unless
specifically modified through the approval process. Through the flexibility of
the planned unit development technique, the planned unit development is
intended to:
      1.   Encourage flexibility in the development of land and in the design
of structures.
      2.   Encourage a creative approach to the use of land that results in
better development and design than might otherwise be accomplished under the
strict application of other sections of this title.
      3.   Allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and
environmentally innovative, and that achieve better utilization of land than is
possible through strict application of standard zoning controls.
      4.   Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and
structural/visual relationships within an environment that allows mixing of
different uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner.
      5.   Provide for the efficient use of land to facilitate a more effective
arrangement of land uses, structures, circulation patterns, and utilities.
      6.   Encourage land development that, to the greatest extent possible,
preserves natural vegetation, respects natural topographic and geologic
conditions, and refrains from adversely affective flooding, soil, drainage, and
other natural ecologic conditions.
      7.   Facilitate the implementation of adopted Village land use policies,
particularly with respect to areas planned for potential redevelopment. For
example, the Village’s Green Infrastructure Plan should be consulted and
adhered to.
   B.   Initiation. The entire property proposed for the planned unit
development must be in single ownership or under unified control. All owners of
the property must be included as joint applicants on all applications and all
approvals will bind all owners.
   C.   Authorization. A planned unit development is authorized in all zoning
districts. A planned unit development shall be granted in accordance with the
procedures and standards of this section.
   D.   Deviations from district regulations.
      1.   The planned unit development is subject to the underlying zoning
district’s standards unless deviations are specifically granted. The Planning
and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may grant,
deviations to the applicable zoning district’s standards. Such deviations may
be granted for planned unit developments if they:
         a.   Enhance the overall merit of the planned unit development.
         b.   Promote the objectives of both the Village and the development.
         c.   Enhance the quality of the design of the structures and the site

         e.   Are compatible with adopted Village land use policies.
         f.   Provide a public benefit to the Village, as described below.
      2.   Deviations from district regulations may be granted where it is
determined that such modifications do not negatively affect the value and
enjoyment of surrounding property, the provision of municipal services, or
traffic circulation on-site and off-site. To be granted such deviations, the
applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities. In no case
may a deviation from district regulations be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates a substantial benefit to the Village. Design characteristics and
amenities to be considered in this determination include, but are not limited
to, the following:

         i.   A senior housing set-aside, either rental or for-sale.
   E.   Procedure. The following procedures, requirements, restrictions, and
conditions are required. In addition to the special use procedures, approval of
a planned unit development includes a pre-application consultation, required
concept plan review, preliminary plan approval, and final plan approval. A
preliminary plan and a final plan may not be submitted and reviewed
simultaneously but must follow the procedures as laid out sequentially in this
section.
      1.   Pre-Application Consultation.
         a.   Prior to formal submittal of an application, a pre-application
conference with the Zoning Officer is required. Additional Village staff,
consultants, or officials may attend the meeting as deemed necessary and
appropriate.
         b.   At a pre-application consultation, the applicant must provide
information as to the location of the proposed planned unit development, the
proposed uses, proposed improvements including the public benefits and
amenities, anticipated exceptions to this title, and any other information
necessary to explain the planned unit development.
         c.   The purpose of such pre-application consultation is to make
advice and assistance available to the applicant before preparation of a
concept plan, so that the applicant may determine whether the proposed planned
unit development is in compliance with the provisions of this title and other
applicable regulations, and whether the proposed planned unit development
aligns with the adopted land use policies of the Village.
         d.   The pre-application conference does not require formal
application, fee, or filing of a planned unit development application. Any
opinions or advice provided by the Zoning Officer, other Village staff,
consultants or officials are in no way binding with respect to any official
action that may be taken on the subsequent formal application.
      2.   Concept Plan. Before submitting a formal application for a planned
unit development, the applicant must present a concept plan before the Planning
and Zoning Commission for the purpose of obtaining information and guidance
prior to formal application. The concept plan will be presented at a public
meeting and no notice is required. At minimum, the concept plan must consist of
the following:
         a.   A map or maps in general form containing the proposed land uses,
the natural features of the development site, the character and approximate
location of all roadways and access drives proposed within the planned unit
development, the location of all adjacent public streets, public utilities, and
schematic drawings showing the size, character, and disposition of buildings on
the site.
         b.   A written statement containing a general explanation of the
planned unit development, including a statement of the present ownership of all
the land within said development and the expected schedule of construction.
         c.   The Planning and Zoning Commission will review the concept plan
and provide such information and guidance it deems appropriate. Any opinions or
advice provided by the Planning and Zoning Commission is in no way binding with
respect to any official action the Planning and Zoning Commission or Village
Board may take on the subsequent formal application. While this review of the
concept plan occurs at a public meeting where the proceedings are subject to
the Illinois Open Meetings Act, this review is not a public hearing.
      3.   Preliminary Plan.
         a.   Action by Zoning Officer. An application for a preliminary plan
for a planned unit development must be filed with the Zoning Officer. Once it
is determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Officer will
schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
         b.   Action by Planning and Zoning Commission.
            (1)   Within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application,
unless an extension of time is agreed to by the applicant and the Zoning
Officer, the Planning and Zoning Commission will consider the preliminary plan
at a public hearing.
            (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission will review the
application based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant
to the approval standards of this section and the approval standards for a
special use. The Planning and Zoning Commission must recommend either approval,
approval with conditions, or denial of the preliminary plan.
            (3)   Following the closing of the public hearing, the Planning and
Zoning Commission will forward its recommendation to the Village Board.
         c.   Action by Village Board. The Village Board will review the
preliminary plan within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning
Commission recommendation, unless an extension of time is agreed to by the
applicant and the Village Board. The Village Board must approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the preliminary plan.
         d.   Conditions. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and
the Village Board may impose, such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the
planned unit development as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the
public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditions and restrictions must be
incorporated into the final plan.
         e.   Approval Standards. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make
a finding that the following standards for a planned unit development have
generally been met, which the Village Board will consider in its decision.
            (1)   The proposed planned unit development meets the purpose of a
planned unit development.
            (2)   The proposed planned unit development will not be injurious
to the use and enjoyment of other property in the vicinity.
            (3)   The proposed planned unit development will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property.
            (4)   There is provision for adequate utilities, drainage, off-
street parking and loading, pedestrian access, and all other necessary
facilities.
            (5)   There is provision for adequate vehicular ingress and egress
designed to minimize traffic congestion upon public streets.
            (6)   The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas,
walks, landscape, lighting, and other site design elements are compatible with
the surrounding neighborhood and adjacent land uses.
         f.   Expiration. The preliminary plan approval expires if a complete
application for approval of a final plan has not been filed within two (2)
years after the date the Village Board grants preliminary plan approval. As
part of the Village Board approval of the preliminary plan, the Village Board
may approve a longer period of validity. An extension of this period of two (2)
years may also be granted by the Village Board if the applicant requests an
extension in writing prior to the expiration date of the approval. A public
hearing for an extension of time of a preliminary plan is not required.
      4.   Final Plan. Following the approval of the preliminary plan, an
application for a final plan for a planned unit development must be filed with
the Zoning Officer.
         a.   Action by Village Engineer. The Village Engineer will review the
final plan take the following action:
            (1)   If the final plan is in substantial compliance with the
approved preliminary plan, the Village Engineer will recommend approval of the
final plan to the Village Board. The Village Engineer will certify to the
Village Board that the final plan is in substantial conformance with the
previously filed preliminary plan.
            (2)   If the final plan is not in substantial conformance with the
approved preliminary plan, the Village Engineer must inform the applicant as to
specific areas found not to be in compliance, and the applicant must resubmit
the final plan to the Village Engineer with changes to those areas found not to
be in substantial compliance and the validity of the preliminary plan remains
in effect. If the revised final plan remains noncompliant with the preliminary
plan, the applicant may request that the Village Engineer render a decision to
be forwarded to the Village Board. In such case, the Village Engineer will
recommend to the Village Board that the final plan be denied. If denied, the
applicant may reapply by submitting a new preliminary plan.
         b.   Action by Village Board. After receipt of the Village Engineer
recommendation, the Village Board must review the final plan. The Village Board
must approve or deny the final plan. If denied, the applicant may reapply by
submitting a new final plan and the validity of the preliminary plan remains in
effect. If subdivision is part of the development of the planned unit
development, the final plan will be reviewed simultaneously with the final plat
following the Planning and Zoning Commission review of the final plat.
         c.   Effect of Approval. After final plan approval, the final plan
will supplements the development regulations applicable to the subject
property. The planned unit development must be developed in accordance with the
final plan and the applicable zoning district regulations. Violation of the
final plan approval or any condition of approval is a violation of this title
and constitutes grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for the planned
unit development.
         d.   Expiration. The final plan approval expires if a building permit
has not been issued within two (2) years after the date the Village Board
grants final plan approval. As part of the Village Board approval of the final
plan, the Village Board may approve a longer period of validity. An extension
of this two (2)-year validity period may be granted by the Village Board if the
applicant requests an extension in writing prior to the expiration date of the
original approval.
   F.   Modifications to approved final plans. No adjustments may be made to
the approved final plan, except upon application to the Village in accordance
with the following:
      1.   Administrative Modifications. The Zoning Officer may approve the
following administrative modifications to an approved final plan when it is
determined by the Zoning Officer that such changes are in substantial
conformance with the approved final plan. Any changes considered a minor or
major modification, as defined in this section, cannot be approved as an
administrative modification. No notice is required for an administrative
modification.
         a.   Changes in building location of no more than five feet (5') that
continue to meet the requirements of this title and any conditions of the final
plan approval.

      2.   Minor Modifications. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve
the following minor modifications to an approved final plan when it is
determined by the Commission that such changes are in general conformance with
the approved final plan. Any changes considered a major modification, as
defined in this section, cannot be approved as a minor modification. The
Planning and Zoning Commission, at its sole discretion, may choose to classify
a modification that meets the criteria of this section as a major modification
to be approved by the Village Board. A public hearing is not required for
consideration and approval of a minor modification. When calculating
percentages, all fractions are rounded up to the nearest whole number.
         a.   Changes required during construction when related to final
engineering issues such as topography, drainage, underground utilities,
structural safety, or vehicular circulation.

addition, any of the following are considered major modifications:
            (1)   Any request for an extension of time of the final plan
approval.
            (2)   Changes to any conditions imposed as part of final plan
approval.
            (3)   Reductions or alterations in the approved public benefit and
amenities to be provided.
            (4)   Any development action that does not comply with zoning
district regulations.
         b.   All major modifications to the final plan must be approved by the
Village Board. Approval of major modifications will follow the special use
process including conducting a properly noticed public hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The Village Board may only approve changes to
the final plan if they find such changes are in general conformance with the

provide for a low-density, semi-rural environment of detached single-family
dwellings on relatively large lots of two (2) acres or more.
      3.   RE-3 Residential Estate District. The RE-3 district is intended to
provide for a low-density, semi-rural environment of detached single-family
dwellings on relatively large lots of one and a quarter (1.25) acres or more.
      4.   R-1 Residential District. The R-1 district is intended to provide
for a moderate density environment of detached single-family dwellings on lots
of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet or more.
      5.   R-2 Residential District. The R-2 district is intended to provide
for a moderate density environment of detached single-family dwellings on lots
of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet or more.
      6.   R-3 Residential District. The R-3 district is intended to provide
for a moderate density environment of detached single-family dwellings on lots
of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more.
      7.   R-4 Residential District. The R-4 district is intended to provide
for a moderate density environment of detached single-family dwellings on lots
of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more. The R-4 district is intended only
for areas where adequate public utilities and other infrastructure exist, and
where such development will not negatively impact adjacent lower density
residential neighborhoods.
   B.   Commercial districts. The commercial districts (“C districts”) are
primarily for commercial land uses such as those related to retail, service,
office, research and development or light industrial uses.
      1.   C-1 Local Commercial District. The C-1 district is intended for
smaller-scale commercial uses that serve the local community. The C-1 district
applies to areas of commercial uses that are targeted at serving Village
residents and are compatible in scale and intensity with nearby residential
areas.
      2.   C-2 General Commercial District. The C-2 district is intended for
areas with a variety of higher intensity commercial uses generally serving a
wider geographic area. The C-2 district accommodates a range of commercial uses
and business types, including, but not limited to, freestanding retail and
office buildings and multi-tenant retail centers. The C-2 district standards
are intended to enhance the appearance of these areas and provide adequate
buffering between residential areas located adjacent to the district.
      3.   RD Research and Development District. The purpose of the RD district
is to accommodate research and development facilities and larger office
structures that may include lighter industrial uses.
   C.   Agricultural and natural area districts. The agricultural and natural
area districts (“A districts”) are primarily for agricultural, agri-business,
or open space uses. This category of A districts includes an overlay district
for environmentally sensitive areas.
      1.   F Farming District. The F district is intended to promote and
protect agricultural land. The standards of the F district are to protect and
promote the continuation of farming, and to protect agricultural land uses from
encroachment of incompatible developments.
      2.   FB Farm-Business Overlay District. The FB overlay district is
intended to promote business actively and directly used by those engaged in the
pursuit of agricultural activities, including commercial and industrial sues,
located within rural and agricultural areas. The FB overlay district can be
applied to rural districts such as the F and RE-1 districts.
      3.   FP Farmland Preservation District. The purpose of the FP District is
to provide a zoning district for properties where at least seventy-five percent
(75%) is the subject of a deed of an agricultural conservation easement as a
perpetual restriction of uses of such property, whether the easement is
conveyed to Kane County or Campton Hills or a Township to the extent permitted
by statute or other applicable law, with the primary purpose of protecting the
agricultural soils, agricultural viability, and agricultural productivity of
properties subject to the easement.
      4.   OSP Open Space Preservation District. The OSP district is intended
to provide and protect private and public open space and public recreational
facilities, both outdoor and indoor. Larger regional open spaces/parks may
include both active and passive recreation areas and certain ancillary
commercial activities, such as cultural facilities, performance venues, and
restaurants. Designation of a parcel as part of the Open Space Preservation
District on the official Zoning Map does not indicate whether the parcel is
privately or publicly owned. Additionally, designation of a parcel as part of
the Open Space Preservation District does not confer public access to the
parcel. For public and private ownership of parcels in the Open Space
Preservation District, please see
Appendix 1  of this title, Open Space Ownership Map.
      5.   ESA Environmentally Sensitive Area Overlay District. The purpose of
the ESA overlay district is to preserve environmentally sensitive areas while
allowing for residential development. The intent is to work with natural land
features and cluster residential development within the larger development
space to leave the remainder of the site as natural areas or open space. This
type of conservation design helps to achieve numerous environmental and
ecological benefits, including wildlife management and habitat preservation,
water quality protection, and greater aquifer recharge. The ESA Overlay
District should be linked to the Village’s Green Infrastructure Plan. (Ord. O-
24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-5-2:   ZONING MAP:
   A.   Location of districts.
      1.   The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by
this title are set forth in the Village of Campton Hills Zoning Map (“the
Zoning Map”), as periodically amended. The Zoning Map is incorporated into, and
made an integral part of, this title.
      2.   It is the intent of this title that the entire area of the Village,
including all land and water areas, are included in the zoning districts
established by this title. Any land lying within the Village, but not shown on
the Official Zoning Map as being included within a district, is classified as
the F Farming District.
   B.   Interpretation of Boundary Lines. Where uncertainty exists with respect
to boundaries of the various zoning districts as depicted on the Zoning Map,
the following rules shall apply:
      1.   Right-of-Way Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines are
indicated as following public or private streets, highways, expressways,
easements, railroads, or waterways (streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other
bodies of water), the boundary line is construed to be the centerline of the
right-of-way.
      2.   Property Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a
recorded property line, the property line is construed to be the boundary line
of the zoning district.
      3.   Vacated Areas. Streets, alleys, or other public rights-of-way that
have been vacated will be construed to fall in the same zoning district as the
lots abutting both sides of the street, alley or right-of way involved. If the
lots abutting each side of the street, alley or right-of-way were classified in
different zoning districts before the vacation, the center line of the street,
alley, or right-of-way shall be construed as the boundary between the zoning
districts.
      4.   Clarification of Boundary Lines. The Zoning Officer will decide any
interpretations of zoning district boundary lines, where the application of
items 1 through 3 of this section above leaves doubt as to the boundary between
two (2) zoning districts. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-5-3:   ANNEXED LAND:
Any territory annexed into the Village is, upon annexation, zoned as the RE-
1 Residential Estate District, unless otherwise provided for in the annexation
agreement or the territory is rezoned. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-5-4:   EXEMPTIONS FOR RIGHT-OF-WAY AND PUBLIC UTILITIES:
   A.   The following utility-related equipment and devices are exempt from the
provisions of this title and are permitted in any district: wires, cables,
conduits, vaults, laterals, pipes, mains, hydrants, valves and water supply
wells.
   B.   This exemption does not include wireless telecommunications, amateur
HAM radio towers, solar energy systems, or wind energy systems. All such
structures must comply with this title and any other applicable Village
ordinances. This exemption also does not apply to buildings established by or
used by utility companies or agencies. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)

apply to new construction, substantial repair or rehabilitation meant to remedy
damage or deterioration of the exterior façade of an existing structure, and
additions to an existing structure. The aforementioned design standards apply
only to commercial zoning districts, including the RD District. These standards
do not apply to interior remodeling.
   B.   Commercial district design standards. Table 6-4. General Building
Design Standards, indicates the applicability of general building design
standards to the commercial districts. An “X” indicates that the standard is
applicable in the district indicated. A blank cell indicates that the standard
is not applicable. (See
Table 6-4  at the end of this chapter.)

      3.   Galvanized steel;
      4.   Exposed aggregate concrete wall panels;
      5.   Exterior insulating finish systems (EIFS);
      6.   T-111 composite plywood siding; and
      7.   Plastic. For the purposes of this paragraph “plastic” is defined as
a synthetic, thermoplastic, or solid polymer based on hydrocarbons.
      8.   Vinyl. For the purposes of this paragraph “vinyl” is defined as a
form of plastic, the equivalent hydrocarbon radical (CH2=CH), derived from
ethylene.
   D.   Roof-mounted mechanical equipment.
      1.   For the purposes of this chapter, roof-mounted mechanical equipment
shall include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment,
electrical generators, and similar equipment. Mechanical equipment in this
chapter does not include solar panels or wind turbines.
      2.   Roof-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from view from a
public street by a parapet wall on all four sides. Alternatively, the equipment
may be housed a rooftop enclosure that is architecturally integrated with the
building. If used, such a rooftop enclosure shall be the minimum size and
height necessary to conceal the mechanical equipment. Neither roof-mounted
mechanical equipment nor their enclosures shall count toward the maximum
allowable height of the building.

required if the proposal does not involve the erection of a new tower.
         e.   The service area of the proposed wireless telecommunications
system.
         f.   If the proposal is for a new telecommunications tower, then a map
showing collocation opportunities within the Village and within areas
surrounding the borders of the Village must be provided and justification for
why co-location is not feasible in order to demonstrate the need for a new
tower.
         g.   If the proposal is for a new telecommunications tower,
certification by a licensed and registered professional engineer regarding the
manner in which the proposed structure will fail. The certification may be
utilized, along with other criteria such as applicable regulations for the
district in question, in determining if additional setback should be required
for the structure and other facilities.
      2.   Height. The maximum height of a wireless telecommunications tower is
the minimum needed to function satisfactorily. The application for approval of
a wireless telecommunications tower must demonstrate the minimum height needed
for the tower to function, which will be reviewed and approved as part of site
plan review. The Village has the ability to hire an independent consultant to
assist in reviewing the proposed height, whose fee will be charged to the
applicant.

Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration or the Village, towers must
have a galvanized silver or gray finish.
      6.   Specific Standards for Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS).
         a.   If a distributed antenna system (DAS) is installed and entirely
enclosed within a principal building, the requirements of this title do not
apply.
         b.   All equipment related to a distributed antenna system must be
mounted/co-located on existing poles or other existing structures unless it can
be shown that an alternate location will be less obtrusive and/or more
beneficial to the public. The design of any new pole requested requires special
use approval.
         c.   An applicant seeking installation of a distributed antenna system
must demonstrate that it has made efforts to blend or camouflage the system
with existing facilities and surroundings or has otherwise screened or
concealed the system from view. Approved blending methods include, but are not
limited to, location of equipment other than antennas within a tree canopy or
other inconspicuous location, use of green, brown or other colored equipment
(if commercially available to the applicant) designed to mimic the colors and/
or materials of the tree canopy, co-location structure or other nearby
structures, as well as use of textures and shapes as appropriate, all with the
intent of minimizing the visual impact of the system. Unnatural colors and
exposed cables are prohibited.
         d.   All pole-mounted distributed antenna systems must be installed at
a minimum height of nine feet (9') above the ground. Equipment may be housed in
a cabinet at ground level only with the approval of the Village as to location
and with appropriate screening.
         e.   Distributed antenna systems may not extend more than seven feet
(7') above the height of the existing pole or other structure on which it is
installed.
         f.   Where distributed antenna systems are placed in residential
districts, every effort must be made to avoid placement at right of way
locations directly in front of a residence. If placement directly in front of a
residence is necessary for technological reasons, the Village has the right to
require screening or impose other design mitigation requirements.
         g.   The Village may request that a particular node or nodes be placed
in an alternative location to that proposed by the applicant. Where a request
for an alternative location is unable to be accommodated by an applicant, the
applicant must supply an explanation in writing as to why the suggested
alternative location will materially compromise the functioning of the system
or is otherwise impractical.
      7.   Abandonment. Any wireless telecommunications system that is not
operated for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days is
considered abandoned. The owner must immediately remove the tower or facility,
and all aboveground equipment and related debris. The Village may ensure and
enforce removal by means of its existing regulatory authority. (Ord. O-24-22,
12-3-2024)

in residential zoning districts shall be one hundred twenty (120) square feet.
There is no limit on the number of chicken coops. Additionally, chicken coops
shall count toward maximum accessory structure square footage standards of
Chapter 8.
         c.   The chicken coop must be designed to ensure the health and well-
being of the chickens, including protection from predators, the elements, and
inclement weather. Neither chicken coop nor run shall be built on a septic
field. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-9-7:   EQUINES:
The provisions of this section govern the keeping equines in all zoning
districts where they permitted per Sections
10-9-1 ,
10-9-2  and
10-9-3  above.

and well-being of the animals, including protection from predators, the
elements, and inclement weather.
      5.   Adequate utility services and drainage facilities, as determined by
the village engineer, shall be provided.
      6.   All equines must be kept in a manner to prevent any adverse impact,
including but not limited to odor, noise, drainage, or pest infestation, on any
other property.
      7.   The method of manure storage must be in a covered container and must
be conducted so as not to be offensive and to minimize any health hazards and
nuisance. Manure must be removed on a regular basis.
   C.   Ancillary activities. The following ancillary activities are permitted
as part of keeping horses and other equine:
      1.   Riding lessons; and
      2.   Boarding horses; and
      3.   Therapeutic riding. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-9-8:   BARNYARD ANIMALS:
The provisions of this section govern the keeping of barnyard animals in all
zoning districts where they permitted per Sections
10-9-1 ,
10-9-2  and
10-9-3  above.
   A.   Number of barnyard animals allowed. Where allowed on residentially
zoned lots per
Table 9-1 , the maximum number of barnyard animals shall be as follows:
      1.   The maximum number of hooved barnyard animals shall be three times
the number of equines allowed. For example, if the maximum number of equines
allowed on a lot is four (4) the total number of all hooved animals would be
twelve (12).
      2.   In addition to the hooved barnyard animals, an unlimited number of
non-hooved barnyard animals may be kept.
   B.   Shelter. An enclosed and roofed shelter shall be provided for all
animals. The shelter must accommodate a space for each animal. Shelters and
fenced enclosures shall be located in accordance with the following:

10-10-7: Site Landscaping
10-10-8: Buffer Yards
10-10-1:   LANDSCAPE PLAN:
   A.   Landscape Plan Required. A landscape plan is required as part of a site
plan review (Section
10-3-7 ) application for non-residential (including mixed-use) developments and
any planned unit development. The landscape plan must be approved prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
   B.   Content of Landscape Plan. The following details shall be included on
all landscape plans required by this chapter:
      1.   North arrow and graphic scale, the location and dimensions of all
existing and proposed structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and
drives, rights-of-way, refuse disposal and recycling areas, pedestrian and
bicycle paths, fences, mechanical equipment, overhead utility wires,
underground utilities, retention/detention facilities, and other drainage
facilities, such as drainage swales.
      2.   Tree preservation plan. See Section
10-10-2  below.
      3.   The location, quantity, size, root ball condition (e.g. B/B) and
scientific and common names of the proposed plants; and
      4.   Specification of the type, boundaries, size and spacing of all
proposed ground cover; and
      5.   The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at
one-foot (1') intervals. Any proposed berming, earthwork, or stormwater
management basins must also be indicated using one foot contour intervals.
      6.   Elevations of all proposed fences, stairs, and retaining walls.
      7.   A title block indicating the preparer, applicant, date of plan and
any subsequent revisions to the plan.
      8.   Any other details as determined by the Zoning Officer.
   C.   Minor Revisions to Approved Landscape Plans. Once a landscape plan has
been approved, the Zoning Officer may authorize minor revisions to the plan,
such as substitution of equivalent plantings, where such revisions do not
diminish the benefits or aesthetics of the approved plan. Minor revisions are
situations where none of the following occur:
      1.   A reduction in the quality of material, e.g. replacing a native
plant with a non-native plant;
      2.   Significant changes in the size and location of plant material;
      3.   A change in the general category of plant material, e.g. replacing a
canopy, or street tree, with an ornamental tree. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-2:   TREE PRESERVATION PLAN:
   A.   Purpose and contents of tree preservation plan. The inventory of trees
on site is a fundamental step in assessing the opportunities for development
and tree preservation. Such a plan shall include:
      1.   A survey, to scale, that identifies the location of all trees on
site that are larger than six inches (6") Diameter Breast Height (DBH) as
measured at four and a half feet (4.5') above the ground;
      2.   Each tree’s DBH at four and a half feet (4.5') above ground;
      3.   The scientific name and common name for each of the trees;
      4.   Condition (e.g. grades 1 through 5 indicating overall health and
quality of tree);
      5.   Proposed fate of each tree (removal, replacement, relocation or
preservation);
      6.   Protection measures to minimize construction impacts on those trees
to be preserved. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-3:   ENFORCEMENT OF LANDSCAPE PLAN:
   A.   No certificate of occupancy will be issued until all the requirements
of this Chapterand the landscape plan have been fulfilled. Failure to implement
the landscape plan, or to maintain the lot in conformance with the landscape
plan, may result in the application of fines and penalties, as established in
this title. All landscapes are subject to periodic inspection.
   B.   If weather prohibits the installation of landscape at the time a
certificate of occupancy is applied for, a temporary certificate of occupancy
may be issued with provision of a cash bond of one thousand five hundred US
dollars ($1,500.00) or funds equaling one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of
the cost of the item(s) to be completed are held in escrow with a bank or title
company or are available to be drawn down from an approved mortgage. (Ord. O-
24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-4:   SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Selection.
      1.   The most recent edition of the American Standards for Nursery Stock,
ANSI Z60.1, published by American Horticulture Industry Association (d/b/
a American Hort), shall be the guide for selection, measurement installation,
and maintenance of all plant material.
      2.   Each category of plant material (canopy trees, ornamental trees,
shrubs, grasses) shall consist of at minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of
plant material that is native to Illinois. Forbs, groundcover plants, annuals
and perennials are exempt from this requirement.
      3.   Where appropriate, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant
material is preferred.
      4.   Invasive species of Illinois and the Great Lakes region (Wisconsin,
Michigan, Indiana) are prohibited. The Village may maintain a list of invasive
and prohibited species and may alter the list from time to time.
   B.   Installation.
      1.   All landscape materials must be installed in accordance with current
nursery industry standards and must be properly supported to ensure survival.
      2.   Support devices such as guy wires or stakes must not interfere with
pedestrian or vehicular movement. Plantings over three feet in height are
prohibited in the site triangle per Section
10-8-1  E.
      3.   All plant materials must be free of disease and installed so that
soil of sufficient volume, composition, and nutrient balance are available to
sustain healthy growth.
      4.   Installation of plant materials during the appropriate growing
season is encouraged.
      5.   Where overhead utilities are present, the following provisions apply
to the selection and installation of plant materials:
         a.   Only trees twenty-five feet (25') or less in anticipated height
at maturity are permitted within twenty feet (20') of any overhead utilities.
Shrubs, grasses, vines, and other plant materials less than twenty-five feet
(25') in height are also permitted.
         b.   Any tree species taller than twenty-five feet (25') at maturity
must be planted at a setback from utility lines that is equal to or greater
than the tree’s anticipated height at maturity.
   C.   Maintenance.
      1.   Landscape materials depicted on approved landscape plans are
considered a required site element in the same manner as structures, required
parking, lighting, and other improvements. As such, the owner of record or the
business or homeowner’s association is responsible for the maintenance, repair,
and replacement of all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls, and
similar landscape elements.
      2.   All landscape materials must be maintained in good condition,
present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, and be kept free of refuse and
debris. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced within sixty
(60) days of notification, unless an extension is approved by the Zoning
Officer. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-5:   LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Minimum planting sizes.
      1.   Canopy trees must have a minimum trunk size of two and one half
inches (2.5") in caliper at planting.
      2.   Single-trunk ornamental trees must have a minimum trunk size of two
inches (2") in caliper at planting.
      3.   Multi-stem ornamental trees must be at least six (6) feet in height
at time of planting.
      4.   Evergreens trees must have a minimum height of six feet (6') at
planting.
      5.   Single stem ornamental trees must have a minimum trunk size of two
and one half inches (2.5") in caliper at planting. Multiple stem ornamental
trees must have a minimum height of eight feet (8') at planting.
      6.   Evergreen or deciduous shrubs must have a minimum height of twenty-
four (24") or thirty (30") inches in height at planting.
   B.   Species diversity. Diversity among required plant material is required
for visual interest and to reduce the risk of losing a large population of
plants due to disease. Table 10-1: Plant Diversity Requirements indicates the
percentage of diversity required based on the total quantity of species being
used. For example, if a development requires forty-five (45) canopy trees, no
more than eighteen (18) trees can be of one species, and there must be a
minimum of five (5) different species within the forty-five (45) trees. When
the calculation of plant diversity requirements results in a fraction, the
fraction is rounded up.
   C.   Berming. Earthen berms and existing topographic features should be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where there is sufficient
space and, in particular, when berms and existing topographic features can be
combined with plant material to facilitate effective screening. Minimum
unretained berm side slopes must be maintained at no steeper than a four to one
(4:1) slope ratio to prevent erosion and be properly and safely maintained,
unless a steeper slope is allowed by the Zoning Officer. Retained slopes may be
implemented with the appropriate terracing necessary to reduce the need for
safety railing. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-6:   PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Parking lot perimeter landscape yard. A perimeter landscape yard is
required for all parking lots that abut a public right-of-way and must be
established along the edge of the parking lot to screen vehicle parking. The
landscape treatment must run the full length of the parking lot perimeter along
the right-of-way and must be located between the lot line and the edge of the
parking lot. The landscaped area must be improved as follows:
      1.   The perimeter parking lot landscape area must be at least eight feet
in width. There must be a minimum linear distance of two feet between any wheel
stops or curbs to accommodate vehicle bumper overhang, which is not included in
the minimum eight-foot (8') calculation.
      2.   One shrub must be planted for every three feet (3') of landscape
yard length, spaced linearly. Alternatively, a mix of shrubs, perennials,
native grasses, and other planting types that provide screening of a minimum of
three feet (3') in height may be used.
      3.   A minimum of one canopy tree must be provided for each fifty (50)
linear feet of perimeter landscape yard. Two(2) ornamental trees may be
substituted for one (1) canopy tree.
      4.   Sixty percent (60%) of the landscape area outside of shrub and tree
masses must be planted in live groundcover, perennials, or ornamental grasses.
      5.   Alternatively, a low pedestrian wall a minimum of three feet (3') to
a maximum of four feet (4') in height may be used instead of shrubs and canopy
trees. Shrubs are encouraged between the sidewalk and the wall to provide a
softening effect on the fence or wall.
   B.   Interior parking lot landscaping. All parking lots consisting of ten
(10) or more spaces require interior parking lot landscape as described in this
paragraph.
      1.   All rows of parking stalls must terminate in a parking lot island or
landscape area.
      2.   Where more than ten parking stalls are provided in a row, one
parking lot island must be provided between every ten (10) parking spaces. As
part of the landscape plan approval, parking lot island locations may be varied
based on specific site requirements or design scheme, but the total number of
islands must be no less than the amount required of one island for every ten
(10) spaces.
      3.   Parking lot islands must be at least the same dimension as the
parking stall. Double rows of parking must provide parking lot islands that are
at least the same dimension as the double row.
      4.   A minimum of one (1) canopy tree must be provided in every parking
lot island or landscape area. If a parking lot island extends the width of a
double row, then two (2) canopy trees are required. In addition to the required
canopy trees, a minimum of sixty percent (60%) of every parking lot island must
be planted in ornamental trees, live groundcover, shrubs, perennials, or
ornamental grasses.
      5.   The use of stormwater management techniques, such as rain gardens
and bioswales, is encouraged in landscape areas. Parking lot islands and
landscape areas are encouraged to be designed to accommodate stormwater
infiltration.
      6.   In addition to parking lot islands, additional landscape areas must
be provided within the interior of parking lots when the parking area is ten
thousand (10,000) square feet or more in area. The minimum total landscape area
of a parking lot, including parking lot islands, must be ten percent (10%) of
the total parking lot area. Parking lot perimeter landscape is excluded from
the calculation of total parking lot area square footage and is not counted
toward required landscape area. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-7:   SITE LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Coverage. All areas of any lot that are not covered by structures or
pavement must be planted with live landscaping. Where non-residential
(including mixed-use) developments are located fifteen feet (15') or more from
a street lot line, and no parking located in front of the structure, the area
must be planted as described below. This does not apply when sidewalks,
driveways, and loading and service areas provide access to the building in the
yard adjacent to the street lot line or where fire department connections are
necessary. Outdoor seating areas, planted pots, and similar hardscape design
may be used to satisfy this requirement for up to thirty percent (30%) of this
area.
   B.   Plant and other materials. The landscape area must be planted with a
variety of canopy and/or ornamental trees, shrubs, live groundcover,
perennials, or ornamental grasses. Decorative stone, brick, or pavement may be
used for edging planting beds but may not cover more than twenty percent (20%)
of the landscaped area. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-10-8:   BUFFER YARDS:
This section establishes standards for the dimension and required landscape for
buffer yards between land uses and/or zoning districts within the rear or
interior side yard. Nothing in this section prevents the applicant’s voluntary
installation of buffer yards where they are not required.
   A.   When required. As of the effective date of this chapter, buffer yards
are required for new construction along interior side and rear yards in the
following cases:
      1.   Where a non-residential use is located within a residential
district. This does not include public parks.
      2.   Where a non-residential district abuts a residential district. This
does not include the OSP district or public parks.
   B.   Location. Buffer yards may be located within required yards but must be
reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as required
by this section. No parking, driveways, sidewalks, accessory structures, or
other impervious surfaces are permitted within the buffer yard area.
   C.   Design requirements. The required design of buffer yards is as follows:
      1.   A buffer yard must be a minimum of ten feet (10') in width.
      2.   One canopy tree must be planted for every twenty-five (25) linear
feet of buffer yard length. As part of the landscape plan approval, trees may
be spaced at various intervals based on specific site requirements, but the
total number of trees planted must be no less than one per twenty-five (25)
linear feet of buffer yard length.
      3.   Existing trees that are preserved may count toward the buffer yard
tree requirement. This credit is at a ratio of one (1) existing tree for one
(1) proposed tree (1:1 ratio) regardless of the size of the existing tree.
      4.   Unless otherwise specifically required by the use standards of this
title, a solid fence or wall a minimum of six feet (6') and a maximum of eight
feet (8') in height must be erected along one hundred percent (100%) of the
buffer yard length.
      5.   One shrub, measuring a minimum of eighteen inches (18") in height at
planting and reaching a minimum of three feet (3') in height at maturity, must
be planted for every three (3) linear feet of buffer yard length, spaced
linearly.
      6.   Sixty percent (60%) of the landscape area outside of shrub and tree
masses must be planted in live groundcover, perennials, or ornamental grasses.
(Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)

10-11-10: Storage Of Recreational Vehicles
10-11-1:   GENERAL APPLICATION:
   A.   Existing facilities.
      1.   The existing number of off-street vehicle and loading spaces may not
be reduced to below the minimum requirements of this title. If the number of
existing spaces is already less than the requirements of this chapter, it may
not be further reduced.
      2.   If a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the effective date
of this title, and if substantial construction has begun within ninety (90)
days of the issuance of a permit, the number of off-street vehicle and loading
spaces is that required by the building permit rather than the requirements of
this title.
   B.   New construction. The construction of a new principal building must
provide all required parking unless the site is eligible for a parking
exemption or other parking flexibility allowed by this chapter.
   C.   Change in use. When the existing use of a structure or land is changed
to a new use, vehicle parking spaces must be provided as required for the new
use.
   D.   Change in intensity of use. Whenever the intensity of a use is
increased, e.g. number of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, or
other unit of measurement used to calculate the number of required vehicle
parking spaces, additional spaces must be provided for the increase in
intensity.
   E.   Provision of additional spaces. The establishment of additional off-
street parking or loading facilities above the minimum required by this title
is not prohibited.
   F.   Use of parking facilities.
      1.   The sale, repair, or dismantling or servicing of any vehicles,
equipment, materials, or supplies, or the display of goods in off-street
parking areas is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by this title.
      2.   The property owner is responsible for ensuring that parking and
loading facilities are only used by tenants, employees, visitors, or other
authorized persons.
      3.   Space allocated to any off-street loading space may not be used to
satisfy the requirement for any off-street vehicle parking space or access
aisle or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street
vehicle parking space may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-
street loading space or portion thereof.
   G.    Prohibition of stand-alone parking structures. Stand-alone parking
structures are prohibited in the Village. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-11-2:   COMPUTATION OF REQUIREMENTS:
This section describes how the number of vehicle and loading spaces are
calculated based upon the requirements of this chapter. The total number of
required vehicle parking and loading spaces is based upon the requirements for
the principal use or uses located on the lot.
   A.   Multiple land uses. Where multiple land uses with different parking
requirements occupy the same structure or lot, the required vehicle parking and
loading spaces are the sum of the requirements for each use computed
separately, unless otherwise permitted by this title.
   B.   Fractions. A fraction of less than one-half (1/2) is disregarded, and a
fraction of one-half (1/2) or more is counted as one parking or loading space.
   C.   Seating as a standard. For uses where patrons or spectators occupy
benches, pews or open floor areas used for service, each forty-eight (48)
linear inches of benches, pews, or permanent seating areas, or five (5) square
feet of open floor areas used for seating is counted as one seat for the
purpose of determining the requirement for the required number of spaces. (Ord.
O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-11-3:   REQUIRED OFF-STREET VEHICLE SPACES:
   A.   General requirements.
      1.   Except as otherwise provided in this title, the minimum number of
off-street vehicle parking spaces to be provided for each use is listed in
Table 11-1 , Off-Street Vehicle Parking Requirements.
      2.   
Table 11-1  lists parking requirements for each use. In some cases, uses that
are considered part of a generic use category are listed with specific vehicle
parking requirements. These specific uses are listed only for the purposes of
this section and do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special
uses within any district. Certain uses listed in
Table 7-1  are not listed in
Table 11-1  and therefore do not have vehicle parking requirements.
   B.   Provision of car-and bike-share facilities.
      1.   Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated
parking spaces for car-share facilities. A car-share facility is a membership-
based car-sharing service that provides automobile rental to members, billable
by the hour or day, and is not considered a vehicle rental establishment.
Spaces reserved for car-share facilities may count toward the minimum parking
requirements of this title.
      2.   Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated
areas for bike-share facilities. A bike-share facility provides bicycle rentals
to the public and it is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. When a
minimum of fifteen (15) bicycles are provided for rental, such bike-share
facilities may be substituted for up to four (4) automobile spaces or five
percent (5%) of the required parking spaces, whichever is less.
   C.   Provision of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.
      1.   Spaces reserved for EV charging count toward minimum parking
requirements of this title.
      2.   The number of EV parking spaces shall be capped at twenty-five
percent (25%) of the overall spaces provided or the overall number of spaces
required.
      3.   At the parking lot owner’s discretion, EV parking spaces may be open
for parking of internal combustion engine vehicles.
   D.   Multi-tenant retail center parking calculation. A multi-tenant retail
center is defined as a group of three (3) or more separate commercial
establishments, primarily retail, but also including personal service,
restaurant, office, and similar non-residential uses, which is planned, owned,
and/or managed as a single property. The two (2) main configurations of multi-
tenant retail centers are large shopping centers and strip centers. Multi-
tenant retail centers require a minimum of one (1) parking space per three
hundred (300) square feet of total gross floor area, rather than calculation by
the individual uses.
Table 11-1. Off-Street Vehicle Parking Requirements

10-11-4:   REQUIRED OFF-STREET LOADING SPACES:
   A.   When required. Off-street loading spaces must be provided for any use
that distributes or receives materials or merchandise by trucks or other
commercial vehicles. In the case of multi-tenant developments, required loading
spaces are calculated on the basis of each individual tenant. For example, if
only one tenant of a multi-tenant development is over ten thousand (10,000)
square feet in gross floor area, only one loading space is required; if all
tenants are under ten thousand (10,000) square feet, no loading is required.
   B.   Standards. The number of minimum loading spaces required for commercial
uses, including industrial uses, is listed in Table 11-2 below.
 
   Table 11-2. Off-Street Loading Space Requirements
Table 11-1 lists the minimum off-street parking requirements for land uses
throughout the Village, where "sf" means square feet and "GFA" means gross
floor area.
Gross Floor Area                             Minimum Off-Street Loading Space
                                             Requirements

10-11-5:   DESIGN OF VEHICLE PARKING FACILITIES:
   A.   Location.
      1.   Residential Uses.
         a.   All required off-street vehicle parking spaces for residential
uses and the residential component of mixed-use developments must be located on
the same lot as the structure.
         b.   For single-family (detached and attached) and two-family
dwellings, required vehicle parking spaces are permitted in private driveways,
but must not encroach onto the public right-of-way.
      2.   Non-Residential Uses. Vehicle parking for a non-residential use may
be located on the same lot or within five hundred feet (500') of the use
served. This maximum distance restriction does not apply to valet parking
services. However, valet parking services must provide evidence of a lot
reserved for vehicle parking.
   B.   Dimensions of vehicle parking spaces.
      1.   Off-street vehicle parking space dimensions must meet the standards
of
Table 11-3  and
Figure 11-1 . All vehicle parking spaces must have a minimum vertical clearance
of seven and a half feet (7.5').

minimum of nine feet (9') for all parking angles, as per
Table 11-3  and
Figure 11-1 .
   C.   Circulation requirements for off-street vehicle parking areas.
      1.   Each off-street vehicle space must open directly upon an aisle or
driveway of adequate width to provide access to a vehicle parking space. All
off-street parking facilities must provide access in a manner that least
interferes with traffic movement. For all uses except single-family detached
and two-family dwellings, the parking area must be designed so that the driver
of the vehicle proceeds forward into traffic rather than backs out.
      2.   All required off-street parking facilities must have vehicular
access from a street, alley, driveway, or cross-access easement.
      3.   Clearly delineated crosswalks of paving, brick paver, bituminous
brick pattern stamping, or painted striping must connect landscaped areas and
parking lot islands to building entrances to improve safe passageway for
pedestrians. Curb cuts must be included on landscaped areas or islands where
such crosswalks are located.
      4.   All parking lots must comply with the “ADA Accessibility Guidelines
for Buildings and Facilities” regulations issued by federal agencies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and State of Illinois requirements for
the amount and design of accessible vehicle parking spaces in parking lots and
structures.
   D.   Striping. Off-street parking areas must be marked by painted lines a
minimum of four inches (4") in width and maintained in clearly visible
condition. Signs or markers should be used as necessary to ensure efficient and
safe circulation within the lot. Vehicle parking spaces for handicapped persons
must be identified with the appropriate sign and visible at all times of the
year, regardless of plant growth or similar conditions.
   E.   Curbing and wheel stops. Wheel stops or curbing are required when a
parking space abuts a pedestrian walkway, landscape area, or fence.
   F.   Surfacing. All parking lots must be surfaced with a durable all-weather
material, such as asphalt, concrete, or other product, as approved by the
Village. Pervious paving may be allowed, subject to review and approval by the
Village.
   G.   Drainage. Off-street parking facilities must be drained to eliminate
standing water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets
and alleys. All drainage must comply with any stormwater management
requirements.
   H.   Maintenance. Off-street parking areas must be maintained in a clean,
orderly, and dust-free condition at the expense of the owner or lessee.
   I.   Lighting. Parking lot lighting must meet the exterior lighting
standards of Chapter 8.
   J.   Landscape and screening. All parking lots must be landscaped and
screened in accordance with Chapter 10.
   K.   Prohibition on dead-end parking lots. Dead end parking lots are

provided equals or exceeds the sum of the spaces required in
Table 11-4 , Shared Parking Calculation.
   B.   Application of
Table 11-4 . Table 11-4 is applied in the following manner:
      1.   The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according
Table 11-1 .
      2.   The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the
percentages for each timeframe according to the appropriate land use category
in
Table 11-3  to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each
timeframe category.
      3.   The numbers are summed for within each timeframe and the highest sum
total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces.
      4.   Shared parking may be located off-site so long as it complies with

10-12-7:   MEASURING SIGNS FOR CONFORMANCE TO ORDINANCE:
   A.   Calculation of sign area. The sign area of each sign is the total
exposed surface devoted to the sign’s message, including all ornamentation,
embellishment, symbols, logos, letters, characters, other figures, or frames,
whether structural or decorative. The calculation of sign area does not include
any supports or bracing. For channel letters or freestanding logos/symbols, the
sign area is calculated as the customary, applicable mathematical formula for
the total area of each square, circle, ellipse, rectangle, or triangle, or
combination thereof, that encompasses each individual letter, logo, background
or display.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1508.png]
 
   B.   Window signs. The maximum area of window signs is calculated as a
continuous surface until divided by an architectural or structural element.
Mullions are not considered an element that divides window area. Only the
individual letters or logos of the window sign shall be used in the calculation
of surface area. The transparent film around the perimeter of the individual
letters or logos comprising the window sign and used to affix the window sign
to the interior or exterior of a windowpane or glass door shall be exempt from
the area calculations, provided that such portion of the transparent film
maintains one hundred percent (100%) transparency of the window.
   C.   Determination of number of sign faces. If the interior angle between
two sign faces is forty-five degrees (45°) or less, the sign area is computed
as the area of one face only. If the angle between two (2) sign faces is
greater than forty-five degrees (45°), the total sign area is computed as the
sum of the areas of the two (2) faces.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1510.png]
 
   D.   Measurement of sign height. For ground signs, sign height is measured
as the vertical distance measured from the normal grade at the base of the sign
to the highest point of the sign, including any decorative elements. Normal
grade shall be construed to be the existing grade prior to construction or the
newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any fill, berm, mound,
or excavation solely for the purpose of locating the sign, whichever is lower.

CHAPTER 13
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
10-13-1: General Applicability
10-13-2: Nonconforming Uses
10-13-3: Nonconforming Structures
10-13-4: Nonconforming Lots Of Record
10-13-5: Nonconforming Site Elements
10-13-6: Nonconforming Signs
10-13-1:   GENERAL APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Purpose. This chapter governs nonconformities: those uses, structures,
buildings, lots or other aspects of development that complied with previous
zoning regulations, but through the adoption of this title, amendments to this
title, or PUD ordinances, no longer comply. The intent of this chapter is to
clarify to what extent and under what circumstances such nonconformities may be
altered, expanded, or allowed to continue. Other purposes of this section are
to:
      1.   Allow for the preservation and adaptive re-use of existing
structures; and
      2.   Recognize the interests of property owners whose property and its
uses were lawfully established; and
      3.   Place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have or potentially
may have adverse effects on surrounding properties or the community.
   B.   Authority to continue a nonconformity. Any nonconformity that existed
on the effective date of this title or any situation that results in a
nonconformity because of the adoption of this title or any amendment hereto,
shall be allowed to exist and continue in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter. A nonconformity may only continue so long as it remains otherwise
legal. A use, structure, lot, or site element that was illegal before this
title was adopted remains illegal.
   C.   Burden on property owner. The burden of establishing the legality of a
nonconformity under the provisions of this title is the responsibility of the
property owner of the subject use, structure, lot, or site element, or the
operator of the subject use.
   D.   Continued status of a nonconformity. Nonconforming status rests with
the property, not with the property owner. Such status is not affected by
changes in tenancy, or management. However, a change in business name shall
result in the removal of all nonconforming signs.
   E.   Safety regulations. All police power regulations enacted to promote
public health, safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all building,
fire and health codes apply to nonconformities. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-13-2:   NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Definition. A nonconforming use is the use of a structure or land that
at one time was an lawful use within a zoning district, but because of the
adoption of this title or subsequent amendments to this title is no longer
permitted or requires special use approval.
   B.   Expansion. A nonconforming use of a structure or land cannot be
expanded, extended, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited
activity includes additions or enlargements of any structure devoted entirely
to a nonconforming use, and any expansion, extension, or relocation of a
nonconforming use to any other structure, any portion of the floor area, or any
land area currently not occupied by such nonconforming use.
   C.   Relocation. A nonconforming use of a structure or land cannot be
relocated, in whole or in part, to any other structure or location on the same
lot. The nonconforming use may only be relocated to another structure or lot if
the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is
relocated.
   D.   Change of use. A nonconforming use can only be changed to a use allowed
within the zoning district where it is located. When a nonconforming use has
been changed, in whole or in part, to an allowed use, the whole or part that
conforms cannot be changed back to a use that is not allowed in the district. A
change of use occurs when an existing nonconforming use has been terminated and
another use has commenced. Any change in use in violation of this title is
deemed an abandonment of the previously existing nonconforming use.
   E.   Discontinuation or abandonment. If a nonconforming use is discontinued,
or the structure that it occupies becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a
continuous period of one year, the nonconforming use is terminated. Any
subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure must comply with all
regulations of the zoning district in which the structure or land is located. A
period of discontinuance caused by acts of God are not included in calculating
the length of discontinuance for this section.
   F.   Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is structurally damaged or destroyed
through no fault of the property owner or tenant, the nonconforming use may be
re-established provided that no new nonconformities are created and the degree
of the previous nonconformity is not increased. If the structure containing the
nonconforming use is also a nonconforming structure, the structure may only be
rebuilt, restored, repaired, or reconstructed in accordance with Section 10-14-
3. However, if a building permit is not obtained within one year of the date of
damage or destruction, then the nonconforming use may not be reestablished.
(Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-13-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
   A.   Definition. A nonconforming structure is a principal or accessory
structure that at one time conformed to applicable zoning regulations, but
because of the adoption of this title or subsequent amendments to the Ordinance
no longer conforms to applicable dimensional regulations.
   B.   Maintenance. Normal maintenance and repair may be performed on any
nonconforming structure. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would
create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing
nonconformity.
   C.   Structural Alterations. No structural alterations are permitted on any
nonconforming structure, except in the following situations:
      1.   When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore
the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with
protecting public safety.
      2.   When the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity.
      3.   When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or
increase the degree of any existing nonconformity. (For example, if a structure
is nonconforming in terms of the required front setback (i.e., does not meet
the required minimum), the structure may add a rear addition if that addition
meets all other bulk and setback requirements of the district.)
   D.   Relocation. A nonconforming structure cannot be relocated, in whole or
in part, to any other location on the same lot unless such relocation would
render the structure conforming. A nonconforming structure may be relocated to
another lot if the structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district
where it is relocated.
   E.   Damage or destruction.
      1.   Non-residential nonconforming structures are subject to the
following:
         a.   In the event that any non-residential nonconforming structure is
damaged or destroyed to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its
replacement value at the time, then the structure may not be restored or
rebuilt unless the structure, including foundation, conforms to all regulations
of the zoning district in which it is located.
         b.   When a non-residential nonconforming structure is damaged or
destroyed to the extent of less than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement
value at the time, it may be repaired and reconstructed to its pre-damaged
state provided that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing
degree of the nonconformity is not increased. A building permit must be
obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction within one
(1) year of the date of damage or destruction. In the event that the building
permit is not obtained within one (1) year, then the structure cannot be
restored unless it conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is
located.
      2.   If a nonconforming single-family or two-family structure is
destroyed or damaged by an act of God, regardless of the percent of damage, it
may be rebuilt to its original condition before such casualty or loss if a
building permit is obtained within one (1) year of the date of damage or
destruction. In the event that the building permit is not obtained within one
(1) year, then the structure cannot be restored unless it conforms to all
regulations of the district in which it is located.
      3.   The replacement value of the structure is based on:
         a.   The sale of that structure within the previous year or, if that
is not applicable;
         b.   An appraisal within the last two (2) years or, if that is not
available;
         c.   The amount for which the structure was insured prior to the date
of the damage or destruction; or
         d.   An alternative method determined acceptable by the Village. (Ord.
O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-13-4:   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
   A.   Definition. A nonconforming lot of record is a lot of record that at
one time conformed to the lot dimension requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located, but because of the adoption of this title or subsequent
amendments to the Ordinance no longer conforms to the applicable lot
dimensions.
   B.   Use. A nonconforming lot of record may be used for a permitted or
special use allowed within the zoning district.
   C.   Development. Development of a nonconforming lot of record must meet all
applicable dimensional or bulk regulations of the district in which it is
located with the exception of that lot dimension requirement that renders it
nonconforming.
   D.   Lot division. No division of a nonconforming lot is permitted that
creates a nonconforming lot and/or renders a lot or lots remaining
nonconforming.
   E.   Common ownership limitation. If two (2) or more lots with contiguous
street frontage are held in common ownership that have historically been used
as a single zoning lot, and one or more of the lots does not meet the
requirements for lot width or lot area as established by this title, the land
is considered to be a single zoning lot for the purposes of this title. No
portion of the lots may be used, transferred, or conveyed unless all lots
created meet the lot width and lot area requirements of this title. No division
of the lot may be made which leaves the remaining lot or lots with lot width or
lot area below the minimum requirements of this title without approval of a
variation. No building permit may be issued for the use of any lot or portion
of a lot transferred or conveyed in violation of this section.
   F.   Building permits. No building permit will be issued for the use of any
lot or portion of a lot, transferred or conveyed in violation of this chapter.

10-13-5:   NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS:
   A.   Definition A nonconforming site element is an aspect or part of the
development of the property, such as landscape or lighting, that at one time
conformed to the requirements of this title, but because of the adoption of
this title or subsequent amendments, has been made nonconforming. This does not
include nonconforming signs, which are regulated separately.
   B.   Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair to a
nonconforming site element may be performed. No repairs or reconstruction are
permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the
previously existing nonconformity.
   C.   Required conformance.
      1.   General. All nonconforming site elements must be brought into
conformance when the following occurs:
         a.   A new principal building is constructed on a site.
         b.   An existing principal building is increased in building footprint
square footage by thirty percent (30%) or more.
      2.   Nonconforming Parking Lot Landscape. When a parking lot of ten (10)
or more spaces does not conform to required parking lot landscape requirements,
it must be brought into conformance when such parking lot is fully
reconstructed or expanded by an additional fifty percent (50%) or more spaces,
i.e. the total number of spaces after expansion is one hundred and fifty
percent (150%) or more of the spaces prior to expansion.
         a.   Resealing, repaving, resurfacing, and/or re-striping of an
existing parking lot are not considered reconstruction.
         b.   If installing landscape would result in a parking lot that cannot
accommodate the required number of spaces, such existing parking lot is not
required to that portion of the required landscape that would reduce the number
of spaces below that required. The applicant is required to show that landscape
cannot be accommodated on the site, which must be verified by the Zoning
Officer. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)
10-13-6:   NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
   A.   Definition. Any sign that existed lawfully prior to the adoption of
this title but no longer conforms to this title is considered a nonconforming
sign and permitted to remain.
   B.   Removal of nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign shall be removed
by the owner or tenant of the subject property if:
      1.   If the principle use on a zoning lot ceases to exist for ninety (90)
consecutive days any sign which was accessory to that use must be removed.
      2.   The sign is damaged or destroyed to the extent that the cost of
repair or replacement exceeds fifty percent of its replacement cost as of the
date it became nonconforming.
      3.   The owner of the property requests and is approved for a rezoning
that will cause the sign to be obsolete or substandard.
      4.   The sign becomes a danger to the safety and welfare of the public.
   C.   Other situations. Signs that are moved or affected by redevelopment of
the property, façade improvement program, or roadway widening cannot be
reinstalled but must be brought into compliance with this chapter unless they
are found to be of historic value to the Village. (Ord. O-24-22, 12-3-2024)

width is measured as follows:
      a.   A line is drawn at the midpoint of the lot between the side lot
lines, extending from the front lot line to the rear lot line.
      b.   Where the required front setback intersects the midpoint line at a
right angle, a line is drawn perpendicular to the midpoint line.
      c.   Lot width is determined as the length of the line between side lot
lines.
      d.   Where the side lot lines angle to increase width towards the rear,
the required lot width measured at the required setback is seventy-five (75%)
of the lot width required by the zoning district.
   3.   For flag lots, lot width is measured at the required front setback as
defined in this section. See Figure 14-8.
