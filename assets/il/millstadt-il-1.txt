§ 38.03 POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT'.
   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
the village to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official,
municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis
of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal
employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually
harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack
thereof.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment. This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently
defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his
position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      (2)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
            1.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of
the municipality.
            2.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
         (c)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is
to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
      (3)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
      (4)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee, or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(a)),
an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in
a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal
law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (ILCS Ch.
740, Act 174, § 15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, §
6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people
to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that
which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of
the alleged retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 5-65, may
be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

measurements and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such a
manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the village.
      (3)   At such times as deemed necessary the village reserves the right to
take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   (B)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of wastes
and wastes in which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the last edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required the control manhole shall be considered to be
the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.

         (b)   Other sewer connections. All charges for use of sewer
connections where water is supplied thereto by the Authority subject to the
special provisions herein shall be as follows:
            1.   A minimum charge of $15.79 monthly for customers residing
within the corporate limits of the village, and $23.69 monthly for customers
residing outside the corporate limits of the village, which rates shall apply
as a service charge so long as the sewer connection is in service and
regardless whether or not water is used during the period, and which minimum
charges shall entitle the user to discharge 1,700 gallons of water monthly into
the sewer system.
            2.   For all water metered to said premises in excess of the 1,700
gallons, a charge therefor shall be at the rate of $9.29 per 1,000 gallons of
water metered for customers residing within the corporate limits of the
village, and at the rate of $13.94 per 1,000 gallons of water metered for
customers residing outside the corporate limits of the village. The above rates
shall apply to the amount of water passing through the water meter except when
an approved discharge metering system is utilized. In this case the rates shall
apply to that water discharged to the system.
   (B)   Basis of wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge for
the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the village
shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus
replacement.
      (1)   (a)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic concentrations:
            1.   A five day, 20° C. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD of 204 mg/
l.)
            2.   A suspended solids (SS) content of 260 mg/l.
         (b)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and shall be computed as follows:
            1.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to
be treated.
            2.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
            3.   Proportion the estimated O, M and R costs to each user class
by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
            4.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and
replacement (O, M and R) costs to wastewater facility categories by volume,
suspended solids and BOD.
      (2)   Wastewater service charge shall be computed as follows:
         CW = CM + CDM + (Vu-X) Cu + (Vu-X) CUD + CS
         Where:
      CW      =   Amount of waste service charge ($) per billing period.
      CM      =   Minimum charge for Operation, Maintenance and Replacement
      CDM      =   Minimum charge for debt service
      Vu      =   Wastewater Volume for the billing period
      X      =   Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge
      Cu      =   Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement
   (C)   Notification. The users of the wastewater treatment service will be
notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributed to the wastewater treatment
operation, maintenance and replacement.
   (D)   Annual review. The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed not less often than annually, by Certificate Public Accountants for
the village in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall
be revised periodically to reflect a charge in local capital costs including
replacement costs.
   (E)   Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of 100 gallons.
      (1)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the Public
Waterworks System, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a
type approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
      (2)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records.
      (3)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the owner. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the village.
   (F)   Automatic increase. In the event that the water supplier for the
village raises water rates and charges for the cost and use of water being
supplied, then those rates and charges shall be automatically applied to the
rates charged by the village to its customers.
   (G)   The rates and charges prescribed in division (A) of this section and
its subdivisions shall increase by 4% on January 1, 2020, and shall increase by
an additional 2% each year thereafter on January 1, with the final increase to
take place on January 1, 2026.

§ 70.31 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time or
in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   (1)   Steady yellow indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being
terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in
§
70.32, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway
before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross
the roadway.
      (2)   Flashing yellow arrow indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow indication may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrows and shall yield the right-of- way to other vehicles and pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or any adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow arrow indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.32, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk
that crosses the lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic
controlled by the flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) and (C)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) and (C)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering
the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the village
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2)
of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   In municipalities with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, after
stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, the driver
of a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to change to
a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds
because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the
arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle's size or weight, shall
have the right to proceed, after yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic
facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign as required by ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-1204.
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall
not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the absence of
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-306) Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.32 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.

“Don't Walk” or the illuminated symbols of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, these signals shall indicate as follows:
   (A)   “Walk” or walking person symbol. Pedestrians facing this signal may
proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given
the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   “Don't Walk” or upraised palm signal. No pedestrian shall start to
cross the roadway in the direction of this signal, but any pedestrian who has
partly completed his crossing on the “Walk” signal or upraised palm symbol
shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the “Don't Walk” signal or
upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady, or flashing.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-307) Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.33 LANE-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever lane-control signals are used in conjunction with official signs,
they shall have the following meanings:

permitted to drive in the lane over which the arrow signal is located.
Otherwise, he shall obey all other traffic controls present and follow normal
safe driving practices.
   (B)   Red X symbol. A driver facing this indication shall not drive in the
lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify
accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present. Otherwise he
shall obey all other traffic controls, and follow normal safe driving
practices.
   (C)   Yellow X (steady). A driver facing this indication should prepare to
vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner to avoid, if
possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed.
   (D)   Flashing yellow arrow. A driver facing this indication may use the
lane only for the purpose of approaching and making a left turn.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-308) Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 70.34 FLASHING SIGNALS.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (B)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
§ 71.001 SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this village at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
divisions (C) and (D) below, by §
71.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in §
70.01) for all vehicles is:
      (1)   Thirty miles per hour; and
      (2)   Fifteen miles per hour in an alley.
   (D)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in a non-urban district is 55 miles per hour.

§ 72.12 UNAUTHORIZED USE OF PARKING SPACES RESERVED FOR HANDICAPPED.
   (A)   (1)   It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle which is not
properly displaying registration plates or decals issued to a person with
disabilities, as defined by § 70.01, pursuant to ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-616,
11-1301.1 or 11-1301.2, or to aveteran with a disability pursuant to ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 3-609, as evidence that the vehicle is operated by or for a
person with disabilities or a veteran with a disability, in any parking place,
including any private or public off-street parking facility, specifically
reserved, by the posting of an official sign as designated under ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, § 11-301, for motor vehicles displaying such registration plates. It
shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle in a designated access aisle
adjacent to any parking place specifically reserved for persons with
disabilities, by the posting of an official sign as designated under ILCS Ch.

When using the parking privileges for persons with disabilities, the parking
decal or device must be displayed properly in the vehicle where it is clearly
visible to law enforcement personnel, either hanging from the rearview mirror
or placed on the dashboard of the vehicle in clear view. Disability license
plates and parking decals and devices are not transferable from person to
person. Proper usage of the disability license plate or parking decal or device
requires the authorized holder to be present and enter or exit the vehicle at
the time the parking privileges are being used. It is a violation of this
section to park in a space reserved for a person with disabilities if the
authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or device
does not enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges are being
used. Any motor vehicle properly displaying a disability license plate or a
parking decal or device containing the International symbol of access issued to
persons with disabilities by any local authority, state, district, territory or
foreign country shall be recognized by state and local authorities as a valid
license plate or device and receive the same parking privileges as residents of
this state.

or a parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with a disability
under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-616, 11-1301.1, or 11-1301.2 or to a veteran
with a disability under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-609 is in violation of this
section if the person using the disability license plate or parking decal or
device is not the authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking
decal or device or is not transporting the authorized holder of the disability
license plate or parking decal or device to or from the parking location and
the person uses the disability license plate or parking decal or device to
exercise any privileges granted through the disability license plate or parking
decals or devices under this code.
      (3)   A driver of a vehicle displaying disability license plates or a
parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with a disability under
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-616, 11-1301.1, or 11-1301.2 or to a veteran with a
disability under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-609 is in violation of this section
if (i) the person to whom the disability license plate or parking decal or
device was issued is deceased and (ii) the driver uses the disability license
plate or parking decal or device to exercise any privileges granted through a
disability license plate or parking decal or device under this code.
   (B)   Any person or local authority owning or operating any public or
private off-street parking facility may, after notifying the Police Department,
remove or cause to be removed to the nearest garage or other place of safety
any vehicle parked within a stall or space reserved for use by a person with
disabilities which does not display person with disabilities registration
plates or a special decal or device as required under this section.

72.99
SNOW EMERGENCIES
§ 72.25 ANNOUNCEMENT OF SNOW EMERGENCY.
   Whenever the Village President finds that falling snow, sleet, or freezing
rain will create a condition which makes it necessary that the parking of motor
vehicles on snow emergency routes be prohibited, or whenever he finds on the
basis of a firm forecast of snow, sleet, or freezing rain that the weather
conditions so forecasted may create a condition making it necessary that such
parking be prohibited, he is authorized to announce such prohibition, to become
effective at a time specified by him. After the effective time of such
prohibition no person shall park any vehicle or permit any vehicle to remain
parked on a snow emergency route. However, if a fall of snow, sleet, or
freezing rain occurs after 11:00 p.m. and prior to 6:00 a.m., and the Village
President has not announced prior to 11:00 p.m. that parking on snow emergency
routes is to be prohibited after a specified time, a vehicle parked on a snow
emergency route may remain so parked until 7:00 a.m. following such fall. The
prohibition of parking announced by the Village President under the authority
of this section shall remain in effect until he announces the termination of
the snow emergency, in part or in whole, after which the prohibition of parking
authorized by this section shall no longer be in effect.
Penalty, see §
72.99
§ 72.26 TERMINATION OF EMERGENCY.
   Whenever the Village President shall find that some or all of the conditions
which gave rise to the snow emergency prohibition no longer exist, he is
authorized to declare the termination of the emergency, in part or in whole,
effective immediately on announcement. If such announcement is made other than
between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., it shall be repeated between those hours.

place of safety any unattended vehicle illegally left standing upon any
highway, bridge, causeway, or in a tunnel, or in a position or under
circumstances as to obstruct the normal movement of traffic.
   (C)   Any police officer is authorized to remove or cause to be removed to
the nearest garage or other place of safety any vehicle found upon a highway

without the consent of its owner;
      (2)   The person or persons in charge of the vehicle are unable to
provide for its custody or removal;
      (3)   The person driving or in control of the vehicle is arrested for an

but municipalities by ordinance may impose a fine up to $350 and shall display
signs indicating the fine imposed. If the amount of the fine is subsequently
changed, the municipality shall change the sign to indicate the current amount
of the fine. It shall not be a defense to a charge under this section that
either the sign posted pursuant to this section or the intended accessible
parking place does not comply with the technical requirements of ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, § 11-301, Department regulations, or local ordinance if a reasonable
person would be made aware by the sign or notice on or near the parking place
that the place is reserved for a person with disabilities.

   INOPERABLE MOTOR VEHICLE.  
      (1)   Shall mean any motor vehicle from which, for a period of at least
seven days, the engine, wheels, or other parts have been removed, or on which
the engine, wheels, or other parts have been altered, damaged, or otherwise so
treated that the vehicle is incapable of being driven under its own motor.
      (2)   Shall not include a motor vehicle which has been rendered
temporarily incapable of being driven under its own power in order to perform

highway, interstate highway, or expressway within the village for two hours or
more, its removal by a towing service may be authorized by the police

   (E)   (1)   Whenever a peace officer reasonably believes that a person under
arrest for a violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501 or a similar provision
of a local ordinance is likely, upon release, to commit a subsequent violation
of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501, or a similar provision of a local ordinance,
the arresting officer shall have the vehicle which the person was operating at
the time of the arrest impounded for a period of not more than 12 hours after
the time of arrest. However, such vehicle may be released by the arresting law
enforcement agency prior to the end of the impoundment period if:
         (a)   The vehicle was not owned by the person under arrest, and the
lawful owner : requesting such release possesses a valid operator's license,
proof of ownership, and, would not, as determined by the arresting law
enforcement agency, indicate a lack of ability to operate a motor vehicle in a
safe manner, or who would otherwise, by operating such motor vehicle, be in
violation of this Code; or
         (b)   The vehicle is owned by the person under arrest, and the person
under arrest gives permission to another person to operate such vehicle,
provided however, that the other person possesses a valid operator's license
and would not, as determined by the arresting law enforcement agency, indicate
a lack of ability to operate a motor vehicle in a safe manner or who would
otherwise, by operating such motor vehicle, be in violation of this Code.
      (2)   Whenever a registered owner of a vehicle is taken into custody for
operating the vehicle in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501 or a
similar provision of a local ordinance or ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-303, a law
enforcement officer may have the vehicle immediately impounded for a period not
less than:
         (a)   Twenty-four hours for a second violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5,
§ 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance or ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
6-303 of this Code or a combination of these offenses; or

the person under arrest and the person under arrest gives permission to another
person to operate the vehicle and that other person possesses a valid

safe manner or would otherwise, by operating the motor vehicle, be in violation
of this Code.
   (F)   Except as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 18a-100 et seq., the
owner or lessor of privately owned real property within this village, or any
person authorized by such owner or lessor, or the police department in the case
of publicly owned real property may cause any motor vehicle abandoned or left
unattended upon such property without permission to be removed by a towing
service without liability for the costs of removal, transportation, or storage
or damage caused by such removal, transportation, or storage. The towing or
removal of any vehicle from private property without the consent of the
registered owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle
is subject to compliance with the following conditions and restrictions:
      (1)   Any towed or removed vehicle must be stored at the site of the
towing service's place of business. The site must be open during business
hours, and for the purpose of redemption of vehicles, during the time that the
person or firm towing such vehicle is open for towing purposes.
      (2)   The towing service shall within 30 minutes of completion of such
towing or removal, notify the police department of such towing or removal, and
the make, model, color, and license plate number of the vehicle, and shall
obtain and record the name of the person at the police department.
      (3)   If the registered owner or legally authorized person entitled to
possession of the vehicle shall arrive at the scene prior to actual removal or
towing of the vehicle, the vehicle shall be disconnected from the tow truck and
that person shall be allowed to remove the vehicle without interference, upon
the payment of a reasonable service fee of not more than one-half the posted
rate of the towing service as provided in division (6) below, for which a
receipt shall be given.
      (4)   The rebate or payment of money or any other valuable consideration
from the towing service or its owners, managers, or employees to the owners or
operators of the premises from which the vehicles are towed or removed, for the
privilege of removing or towing those vehicles, is prohibited.
      (5)   Except for property appurtenant to and obviously a part of a
single-family residence, and except for instances where notice is personally
given to the owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle
that the area in which that vehicle is parked is reserved or otherwise
unavailable to unauthorized vehicles and they are subject to being removed at
the owner or operator's expense, any property owner or lessor, prior to towing
or removing any vehicle from private property without the consent of the owner
or other legally authorized person in control of that vehicle, must post a
notice meeting the following requirements:
         (a)   The notice must be prominently placed at each driveway access or
curb cut allowing vehicular access to the property within five feet from the
public right-of-way line. If there are no curbs or access barriers, the sign
must be posted not less than one sign each 100 feet of lot frontage.
         (b)   The notice must indicate clearly, in not less than two-inch high
light-reflective letters on a contrasting background, that unauthorized
vehicles will be towed away at the owner's expense.
         (c)   The notice must also provide the name and current telephone
number of the towing service towing or removing the vehicle.
         (d)   The sign structure containing the required notices must be
permanently installed with the bottom of the sign not less than four feet above
ground level, and must be continuously maintained on the property for not less
than 24 hours prior to the towing or removing of any vehicle.
      (6)   Any towing service that tows or removes vehicles and proposes to
require the owner, operator, or person in control of the vehicle to pay the
costs of towing and storage prior to redemption of the vehicle must file and
keep on record with the police department a complete copy of the current rates
to be charged for such services, and post at the storage site an identical rate
schedule and any written contracts with property owners, lessors, or persons in
control of property which authorize them to remove vehicles as provided in this
section. The towing and storage charges, however, shall not exceed the maximum
allowed by the Illinois Commerce Commission under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18a-
200.
      (7)   No person shall engage in the removal of vehicles from private
property as described in this section without filing a notice of intent in the
village, and such notice shall be filed at least seven days before commencing
such towing.
      (8)   No removal of a vehicle from private property shall be done except
upon express written instructions of the owners or persons in charge of the
private property upon which the vehicle is said to be trespassing.
      (9)   (a)   Vehicle entry for the purpose of removal shall be allowed
with reasonable care on the part of the person or firm towing the vehicle. Such
person or firm shall be liable for any damages occasioned to the vehicle if
such entry is not in accordance with the standards of reasonable care.
         (b)   Except as authorized by a law enforcement officer, no towing
service shall engage in the removal of a commercial motor vehicle that requires
a commercial driver’s license to operate by operating the vehicle under its own
power on a highway.
      (10)   When a vehicle has been towed or removed pursuant to this section,
it must be released to its owner or custodian within one-half hour after
requested, if such request is made during business hours. Any vehicle owner or
custodian or agent shall have the right to inspect the vehicle before accepting
its return, and no release or waiver of any kind which would release the towing
service from liability for damages incurred during the towing and storage may
be required from any vehicle owner or other legally authorized person as a
condition of release of the vehicle. A detailed, signed receipt showing the
legal name of the towing service must be given to the person paying towing or
storage charges at the time of payment, whether requested or not.
         (a)   This section shall not apply to law enforcement, firefighting,
rescue, ambulance, or other emergency vehicles which are marked as such or to
property owned by any governmental entity.
         (b)   When an authorized person improperly causes a motor vehicle to
be removed, such person shall be liable to the owner or lessee of the vehicle
for the cost of removal, transportation, and storage, any damages resulting
from the removal, transportation, and storage, attorney's fee, and court costs.
         (c)   Any towing or storage charges accrued shall be payable by the
use of any major credit card, in addition to being payable in cash.
      (11)   Towing companies shall also provide insurance coverage for areas
where vehicles towed under the provisions of this chapter will be impounded or
otherwise stored, and shall adequately cover loss by fire, theft, or other
risks. Any person or company who violates this requirement shall be fined not
less than $100 nor more than $500.
   (G)   (1)   When a vehicle is determined to be a hazardous dilapidated motor
vehicle pursuant to ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-40-3.1, its removal and
impoundment by a towing service may be authorized by the police department.
      (2)   When a vehicle removal from either public or private property is
authorized by a law enforcement agency, the owner of the vehicle shall be
responsible for all towing and storage charges.
      (3)   Vehicles removed from public or private property and stored by a
commercial vehicle relocator or any other towing service authorized by a law
enforcement agency in compliance with this section and ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§
4-201 and 4-202, or at the request of the vehicle owner or operator, shall be
subject to a possessor lien for services pursuant to the Labor and Storage Lien
(Small Amount) Act. The provisions of Section 1 of that Act relating to notice
and implied consent shall be deemed satisfied by compliance with ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, § 18a-302 and § 18a-300 (6). In no event shall such lien be greater than
the rate or rates established in accordance with § 18a-200 (6). In no event
shall such lien be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or
materials rendered in addition to those authorized by ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5.
Every such lien shall be payable by use of any major credit card, in addition
to being payable in cash.
      (4)   Any personal property belonging to the vehicle owner in a vehicle
subject to a lien under this division (F) shall likewise be subject to that
lien, excepting only: child restraint systems as defined in Section 4 of the
Child Passenger Protection Act and other child booster seats; eyeglasses; food;
medicine; perishable property; any operator's licenses; any cash, credit cards,
or checks or checkbooks; any wallet, purse, or other property containing any
operator's license or other identifying documents or materials, cash, credit
cards, checks, or checkbooks; and any personal property belonging to a person
other than the vehicle owner if that person provides adequate proof that the
personal property belongs to that person. The spouse, child, mother, father,
brother, or sister of the vehicle owner may claim personal property excepted
under this division (F)(4) if the person claiming the personal property
provides the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with the
authorization of the vehicle owner.
      (5)   This division (F)(5) applies only in the case of a vehicle that is
towed as a result of being involved in a crash. In addition to the personal
property excepted under division (F)(4) of this section, all other personal
property in a vehicle subject to a lien under this division (F) is exempt from
that lien and may be claimed by the vehicle owner if the vehicle owner provides
the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with proof that the vehicle
owner has an insurance policy covering towing and storage fees. The spouse,
child, mother, father, brother, or sister of the vehicle owner may claim
personal property in a vehicle subject to a lien under this division (F) if the
person claiming the personal property provides the commercial vehicle relocator
or towing service with the authorization of the vehicle owner and proof that
the vehicle owner has an insurance policy covering towing and storage fees. The
regulation of liens on personal property and exceptions to those liens in the
case of vehicles towed as a result of being involved in a crash are exclusive
powers and functions of the state. A home rule unit may not regulate liens on
personal property and exceptions to those liens in the case of vehicles towed
as a result of being involved in a crash. This division (F)(5) is a denial and
limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6
of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.
      (6)   No lien under this division (F) shall: exceed $2,000 in its total
amount; or be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or
materials rendered in addition to those authorized by ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5.
   (H)   Whenever a peace officer issues a citation to a driver for a violation
of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-506(a), the arresting officer may have the vehicle
which the person was operating at the time of the arrest impounded for a period
of five days after the time of arrest. An impounding agency shall release a
motor vehicle impounded under this division (G) to the registered owner of the
vehicle under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   If the vehicle is a stolen vehicle;
      (2)   If the person ticketed for a violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-506(a) was not authorized by the registered owner of the vehicle to operate
the vehicle at the time of the violation;
      (3)   If the registered owner of the vehicle was neither the driver nor a
passenger in the vehicle at the time of the violation or was unaware that the
driver was using the vehicle to engage in street racing;
      (4)   If the legal owner or registered owner of the vehicle is a rental
car agency; or
      (5)   If, prior to the expiration of the impoundment period specified
above, the citation is dismissed or the defendant is found not guilty of the
offense.
   (I)   Except for vehicles exempted under subsection (b) of ILCS Ch. 625, Act

circumstances are such that the dog, cat, domestic or other animal should be
confined elsewhere. At the end of the ten-day period, it shall be the duty of

his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or engage in
that conduct.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-4)
§ 130.03 KNOWLEDGE.
   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct,
described by the section defining the offense, when he or she is consciously
aware that his or her conduct is of that nature or that those circumstances
exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the substantial
probability that the fact exists.
      (2)   The result of his or her conduct, described by the section defining
the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that that result is
practically certain to be caused by his or her conduct.
   (B)   Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed willfully,
within the meaning of a statute using the term WILLFULLY, unless the section
clearly requires another meaning.
   (C)   When the law provides that acting knowingly suffices to establish an
element of an offense, that element also is established if a person acts
intentionally.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-5)
§ 130.04 RECKLESSNESS.
   A person is reckless or acts recklessly when that person consciously
disregards a substantial and unjust- ifiable risk that circumstances exist or
that a result will follow, described by the section defining the offense, and
that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation. An act performed recklessly
is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a section using the term WANTONLY,
unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-6)
§ 130.05 NEGLIGENCE.
   A person is negligent, or acts negligently, when that person fails to be
aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a
result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that
failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-7)
§ 130.06 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits the offense of attempt when,
with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act that
constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.
   (B)   Impossibility.  It is not a defense to a charge of attempt that
because of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been impossible
for the accused to commit the offense attempted.
   (C)   Sentence. A person convicted of attempt may be fined or imprisoned or
both not to exceed the maximum provided for the offense attempted. If such fine
exceeds that set forth in § 130.99 below, however, the village shall enforce
said offense under the provisions of state law.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 8-4) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provisions of this title for which another penalty is

reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he or she:
      (1)   Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver,

      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:
      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;
      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
         (c)   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other merits
of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)   Permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer an intent to
disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement, or possession of a mold,
engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.
   (F)   Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted previously of
the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense

all the utilities connected to this structure or premises have been notified to
the impending demolition.
   (C)   The permittee is responsible to first notify all utility companies of
the demolition prior to beginning the project. All rules and regulations of the
utility companies along with the Village and the County Code must be complied
with before, during and after the demolition project.
   (D)   The permittee shall fill only with sand or clean dirt up to the level
grade of the existing surrounding area. The top layer of fill shall be a
minimum of 12 inches soluble soil, capable of encouraging vegetation. Prior to
backfilling, the premises shall be inspected by the Building Commissioner to
verify compliance with all village ordinances. Backfilling prior to obtaining
the necessary inspection by the Building Commissioner may result in removal of
the fill material at the property owner's expense in order to verify
compliance. After demolition of the building and removal of the debris created
thereby, the real estate premises shall be graded, seeded and maintained in
conformity with the established street grades at curb level (where there are
curbs) or street level (where there are no curbs) at the subject building site.
Finish grading shall be made and maintained so as to avoid the accumulation of
water on the subject real estate premises or the illegal diversion of water
onto adjoining real estate premises.
   (E)   The permittee shall comply with all regulations of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency.
   (F)   Lumber, lathe, or other organic materials will not be permitted in the
fill.
   (G)   Material which is not suitable for fill material shall not be used,
but shall be removed from the site of the work and disposed of at the
permittee's expense.
   (H)   All of any materials to be disposed of shall be disposed of at a State
of Illinois approved disposal area.
   (I)   Any authorized material remaining on the premises at the completion of
the work will delay final acceptance until such material has been removed.
   (J)   The premises shall be left in an orderly condition, clean and free of
debris and or building materials.
   (K)   The burning of materials is not authorized or permitted. All
combustible materials shall be removed from the premises.
   (L)   Care shall be taken by a permittee to prevent the occurrence of voids
in the fill or undue settlement after the fill has been placed. Basement floors
shall be removed and cavities (such as but not limited to those created by
basements, cisterns, septic tanks or cellars) shall be backfilled with dirt
(and not with debris or other types of combustible or noncombustible fill
material).
   (M)   The operation of the permittee shall be done in such a manner as to
avoid hazard to persons and properties, interference with the use of adjacent
buildings, and the interruption of free passage to and from such buildings.
   (N)   After work is started on the building, it should be continued promptly
and expeditiously. The permittee shall satisfactorily complete the work within
30 days from the date of issuance of the permit. If the work is not completed,
the village shall be entitled to make a claim to have the bonding company
complete the job.
   (O)   The permittee shall, at all times, reserve and comply with the federal
and state laws, local ordinances, and regulations which affect the conduct of
his work.
   (P)   The permittee shall be solely responsible for all claims and
liabilities arising from or based upon the violation of any such laws,
ordinances, or regulations, whether by himself or his employees.
   (Q)   The permittee shall provide the village with a performance bond in the
amount to be determined by the Building Commissioner and the bond is to be
approved by the Building Commissioner to guarantee that he shall comply with
all the terms of this section.

   The following commercial design section shall apply to commercial land plats
designated B-1 Community Business and B-2 Highway Business District.
   (A)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   The massing (volume and shape) of a building should complement the
massing of existing surrounding buildings.
      (2)   The scale of the building (including height, size, bulk,
aesthetics, and intensity) should blend in with the existing area.
      (3)   Architectural design should create visual interest through the use
of building materials, colors, and textures.
      (4)   (a)   When large structures are required, mass should be broken up
through setbacks, building effects, varied heights, and other architectural
design techniques.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to recommend a
building’s mass and its compatibility to surrounding buildings.
      (5)   Monotony of design in single and multiple building projects is
discouraged.
      (6)   Architectural treatments (e.g. building material, colors, facade
design, roof lines, and screening) shall be consistent and compatible on all
sides. The design of all walls in a single color with little or no detailing is
discouraged.
      (7)   Exterior mechanical, electrical, rooftop equipment, generators, and
the like shall be screened from public view.

a combination of glass and masonry on each face. Masonry materials include
concrete masonry units (cmu), brick, and natural stone. In addition, all
exterior walls from ground level to a minimum of 6'0" above ground level must
consist of masonry and/or glass. Smooth faced units are not permitted unless as
an accent. All concrete masonry units shall be integrally colored (no standard
grey block materials are permitted).
      (2)   Other materials including synthetic stone, cast stone, EIFS, metal
for detailing, copper, slate, and plaster stucco will be allowed as accent
materials only.
      (3)   Exterior construction materials not allowed are: synthetic
materials (vinyl siding, vinyl wrapped details including gutters and
downspouts), plastics, corrugated metal and aluminum siding, unfinished
concrete, wood shingles, rough sawn or untreated wood.
      (4)   No transition in material can be made at an outside corner of a
building. All materials must turn the corner to a point where the corner looks
solidly finished. Material changeover at corners gives a look of thinness and
should be avoided.
      (5)   The Zoning Administrator has the authority to recommend or deny any
additional construction materials upon review.
   (C)   Existing structures, remodels, and expansions.
      (1)   Any existing commercial building addition or expansion that exceeds
50% of the existing square footage shall follow the requirements of this
section for both the addition and the existing building.
      (2)   Additions and expansions of less than 50% of the existing building
shall follow the first three divisions of the design guidelines of this

§ 151.22 MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN.
   The subdivider shall conform to the following principles and standards of
land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion thereof. No
preliminary plat shall be approved unless it conforms to the following minimum
standards of design.
   (A)   Streets and alleys.
      (1)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as to not impose
undue hardship upon the owners of adjoining property when they plat their own
land and seek to provide for convenient access thereto. Reserve strips
controlling access to streets are prohibited, except where their control is
placed with the Village Board of Trustees.
      (2)   The arrangement of rights-of-way in a subdivision shall provide for
the continuation of the existing streets or rights-of-way in adjoining areas,
unless the Plan Commission deems such continuation undesirable for reasons of
topography or design. Where subdivision streets or rights-of-way are
continuations or extensions of existing streets or rights-of-way, the width
thereof shall be of the same or greater width as the existing street or right-
of-way, except that in no case shall the street or right-of-way in the
subdivision be of less width than hereinafter provided.
      (3)   Where, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, it is desirable to
provide future street access to adjoining areas, the streets and rights-of-way
in the subdivision shall be extended to the property line. If deemed necessary
by the Plan Commission, any temporary dead-end street shall be provided with a
temporary turn-around. In no case shall access be denied to any parcel or part
of a parcel of ground by the subdividing of land.
      (4)   Streets shall intersect, as nearly as possible at right angles.
      (5)   Local street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at
least 15 feet; intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall have
radii of not less than 25 feet.
      (6)   Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 125 feet are
prohibited.
      (7)   Unless topography indicates a need for a greater length, dead-end
streets designed to be so permanently shall be no longer than 500 feet and
shall terminate in a circular open space having a radius at the outside of the
pavement of at least 45 feet (see
Appendix B, Figure 3) and a diameter at the outside of the right-of-way of at
least 100 feet.
      (8)   Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through
traffic.
      (9)   No local (minor) street grade shall be in excess of 7% and no
collection street or arterial street grade shall be in excess of 5%, except as
otherwise approved by the Plan Commission due to adverse topographic
conditions. For adequate drainage, the minimum grade of any new street shall
not be less than ½%.
      (10)    The Plan Commission shall not approve streets which will be
subject to frequent inundation or flooding.
      (11)    Alleys shall be avoided in a single-family and two-family
district, except as required by this section, however they may be required in
multiple-family districts and commercial or industrial districts, unless other
definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street
loading, unloading and parking consistent and adequate for the use proposed.
      (12)    Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted, except where provided
with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end, or where such dead-end
alleys provide the only access to off-street parking.
      (13)    Alleys, where provided shall have a right-of-way of not less than
20 feet.
      (14)    The minimum right-of-way of local streets, including marginal
access streets and cul-de-sacs, shall be 50 feet.
      (15)    The minimum right-of-way of secondary or collector streets shall
be 60 feet.
      (16)    The minimum right-of-way of arterial or primary streets shall be
80 feet.
      (17)    Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided.
      (18)    Where the subdivision abuts in or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street, the Plan Commission may require that marginal access
streets be provided in order that no lots front on such existing or proposed
arterial street.
      (19)    Dedication of half-streets shall be discouraged, but may be
permitted whenever there is no other logical method of platting. However,
wherever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to
the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be
platted, unless otherwise permitted by the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Drainage. No plat shall be approved for any subdivision which is
subject to flooding unless the plat conforms to the applicable requirements of
this chapter. (See Chapter 6, Article VI, Flood Plain Code.)
      (1)   No plat shall be approved for any subdivision or part thereof which
is subject to periodic flooding or which contains inadequate drainage
facilities or which makes adequate drainage of streets impossible. However, if
the subdivider agrees in writing to make improvements at his expense which
will, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, make the area safe for human
occupancy and use further provide adequate drainage for streets, then the
preliminary and final plat may be approved.
      (2)   Storm water drainage shall be discharged to marshlands, swamps,
retention basins or other treatment facilities. Diversion of storm water to
marshlands or swamps shall be considered by the Plan Commission for existing or
planned surface drainage. Marshlands and swamps used for storm water shall
provide for natural or artificial water level control.
      (3)   No existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal shall be
deepened, widened, rerouted or filled without written permission from the
village.
      (4)   Where artificial channels must be constructed to augment the
natural drainage system, such channels as well as the natural drainage ways may
be planned as part of a recreation trail system. Channels shall be designed to
be aesthetically compatible for recreational trail use.
      (5)   The drainage system shall be constructed and operational during
construction or as approved by the village.
      (6)   The natural drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for
the storage and flow of runoff.
      (7)   No plat shall be recorded for any subdivision situated within 500
feet of any surface drain or watercourse serving a tributary area of 640 acres
or more until such plan or map has been reviewed by the Department of
Transportation, either independently or in cooperation with federal, state or
local agencies, for the purpose of determining, for the protection of persons
and property, the flood hazards involved, and a report thereon filed by that
Department with the County Recorder.
   (C)   Erosion and sediment control. The following standards shall be applied
in the subdivision and construction of land areas:
      (1)   The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented
by topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
      (2)   Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected so far as is
consistent with development of the site.
      (3)   When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest
feasible period of time.
      (4)   Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that
adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction
progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one
period of time.
      (5)   Erosion and siltation control measures shall be coordinated with
the different stages of development. Appropriate control measures shall be
installed prior to development when necessary to control erosion.
      (6)   Provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.
      (7)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
undergoing development.
      (8)   Temporary vegetation or where appropriate mulching or other
nonviable cover shall be used to protect areas exposed during development.
      (9)   Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall be set
aside for respreading over the developed area. The soil shall be restored to a
depth of four inches and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil
quality prior to development.
      (10)   Permanent, final plant covering or structures shall be installed
as soon as possible.
   (D)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements of not less than ten feet in width shall be provided on
each side of all rear lot lines, and alongside lot lines where necessary for
storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and other mains, and for electric and
telephone lines or for other public utilities. Easements of greater width may
be required along or across lots when necessary for the extension of main
sewers or other utilities or where both water and sewer lines are located in
the same easement. A two-foot easement shall be required on one side of and
adjacent to an alley to accommodate pole lines.
      (2)   Adequate easements for storm water drainage shall be established
along any natural drainage, channel and in such other locations as may be
necessary to provide satisfactory disposal of storm water from streets, alleys
and all other portions of the subdivision. The location and minimum widths of
such easements shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   No tree, shrub or building shall be placed or erected in any
easement for utility or drainage purposes or within the right-of-way of any
street, except at the owner's risk as to all costs for demolition, removal or
reconstruction, and the proper authorities may have free access to and use of
the easements at any time.
   (E)   Blocks; crosswalks.
      (1)   No block shall be longer than 1,800 feet or less than 500 feet in
length, except where the continuity of the existing neighborhood would be
disrupted.
      (2)   All blocks, whenever it is deemed essential to provide access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other community facilities a shall
have a crosswalk with a right-of-way of at least ten feet in width near the
center of the block. (See §
151.22(C)(2))
      (3)   The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to building sites, land use, zoning requirements, access, safety and
convenience.
      (4)   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial or collector, the greater
dimension of the block shall generally front or back upon such arterial or
collector to avoid unnecessary ingress or egress.
   (F)   Parks and other public areas.
      (1)   Where any area is specifically designated on the Comprehensive Plan
of the village, for a public park, playground, school or other public use, and
is owned by the subdivider, such area shall be reserved for such use on all
subdivision plans and plats; and the acquisition of such area may then be
secured by the Village Board of Trustees or arrangements be made for its
acquisition within a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval of
the final plan. The value of such lands shall be established by three qualified
appraisers; one of whom shall be appointed by the Plan Commission, one
appointed by the subdivider, and one of whom shall be mutually-agreed upon by
the other two.
      (2)   Should the Village Board of Trustees decide to take such premises,
then and in that case, it shall make arrangements to pay the subdivider the
appraised value therefor as determined by the above described appraisers, or a
sum that is mutually agreed upon. The Village Board of Trustees may accept any
donation of land as above described should the subdivider desire to contribute
the same to the village.

covenants shall accompany the preliminary plan and shall include a protection
against the obstruction of any surface water drainage easement.
   (H)   Lots.
      (1)   Minimum size. All lots in a subdivision shall conform to the
minimum lot area and dimensions requirements of the zoning district in which
the subdivision is located; land that is under water or reserved for street
improvements shall not be counted in determining compliance with requirements.
(See
Chapter 152, Zoning Code.)
      (2)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
      (3)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
right-of-way lines and radial to curved street right-of-way lines, except where
a variation of this rule will provide a better street and lot design.
      (4)   All remnants of lots below minimum lot area size left over after

completion of all land improvements yet remaining to be installed. Within 60
days of the approval of the final plat, and before construction begins, one of
the following shall be completed naming the village as the insured for
guaranteed party for a minimum period of two years:
      (1)   Deposit with the village a subdivider's bond in the amount of the
110% estimated cost of the land improvements; the bond need never exceed one
and one-half times the estimated cost of the improvements remaining to be
completed; or
      (2)   Deposit with the village cash in the amount of 110% of the
estimated cost of the land improvements; the amount of cash need never exceed
one and one-half times the estimated cost of the improvements remaining to be
completed. Subdivider shall execute an undertaking in lieu of a bond provided
for in
Appendix A, § 5, and shall also deposit with the village an irrevocable
commitment from a financial institution with such terms as are acceptable to
the Village Board of Trustees; or
      (3)   Deposit with the village a lien to be recorded in the County
Recorder's Office on all property being subdivided, with the provision that
partial release may be obtained when the loaning company executes with the
village an agreement to withhold one and one-half times the estimated cost of
the land improvements yet remaining to be installed, in escrow, until such time
as all land improvements have been completed and accepted by the village. All
expenses incurred in determining the amounts apportioned against the land and
the cost of releasing each lot or tract shall be paid by the subdivider; or
      (4)   Deposit with the village, other collateral equivalent to one and
one-half times the estimated cost of land improvements yet remaining to be
installed, such collateral to be approved by the Village Board of Trustees.
   (B)   Construction time constraints. All required land improvements shall be
installed and completed within a period of two years after the recording of the
final plat. Failure of the subdivider to complete all of the improvements
within this two-year period shall result in forfeiture of the guarantee
collateral unless an extension of time is requested by the subdivider and
granted by the Village Board of Trustees. In the event of failure to complete
the improvements in the required period, as stated above, the Village Board of
Trustees may direct that no further building permits be issued for property in
such subdivision pending satisfaction of the Village Board of Trustees in
regard to the status of the required land improvements.
   (C)   Inspection.
      (1)   All required land improvements to be installed under the provisions
of this chapter shall be checked during the course of construction, by or at
the direction of the Zoning Administrator or his designated representative.

found to be faulty or not in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications shall be paid by the subdivider to the village. The testing of
any concrete, asphalt, soil, or other materials and workmanship shall be done
at the direction of the village and at the expense of the subdivider.
   (D)   Release of bond. The subdivider's bond or guarantee collateral shall
be released only upon fulfillment of the following conditions:
      (1)   The completion of all required land improvements.
      (2)   The submission of four copies of acceptable “as-built” drawings of
all land improvements.
      (3)   An affidavit to the effect that:
         (a)   All materials, labor and other costs have been paid, or
arrangements have been made for payment so as to hold the village free from any
obligations for payment of any costs of the land improvements; and
         (b)   That the subdivider accepts responsibility for the maintenance
and repair of all land improvements for two years after the date of the
acceptance resolution by the Village Board of Trustees.
      (4)   Final acceptance, by resolution by the Village Board of Trustees of
all land improvements.

Commission;
   (B)   To transmit improvement plans to the Village Engineer for his review;
   (C)   To issue stop orders as necessary when the Village Engineer determines
that approved improvements are being constructed in violation of this chapter;

complete required improvements;
   (E)   To evaluate and make decisions concerning proposed minor changes in
approved final plats;

Plan Commission;
   (G)   To periodically review the provisions of this chapter to determine
whether revisions are needed, and to make recommendations on such matters to
the Plan Commission as necessary;
   (H)   To maintain up-to-date records of matters pertaining to this chapter,
including, but not limited to, preliminary plats, as-built records of completed
improvements, final plats, variances and amendments; and
   (I)   To provide information to subdividers/developers and to the general
public on matters related to this chapter.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 151.66 SUBDIVISION VARIANCES.
   Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance from the requirements of this
chapter shall file a written application therefor with the Zoning Administrator
at the same time that he files his preliminary plat. The application shall
fully explain the grounds for the variance request, and specify the section(s)
of this chapter which, if strictly applied, would cause great practical
difficulties or hardship. The Administrator shall prepare an advisory report on
variance application and submit it, together with the completed application to
the Plan Commission.
   (A)   Review by Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall review the
variance application and the Administrator's comments, and submit their
advisory report to the Village Board of Trustees, together with their
recommendation on preliminary plat approval. The Plan Commission's advisory
report shall be responsive to all the variances standards set forth in division
(B) below.
   (B)   Action by Village Board of Trustees; variance standards. At the same
meeting at which they take action on the application for preliminary plat
approval, the Village Board of Trustees shall decide by resolution whether to
grant or deny the requested subdivision variance. A copy of their decision,
clearly stating their reasons therefor and the exact terms of any variance
granted shall be attached to both the preliminary and final plats. The Village
Board of Trustees shall not grant any subdivision variance unless, based upon
the information presented to them, they determine that:
      (1)   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this chapter;
      (2)   Strict application of the subdivision design and improvement
requirements would result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the
applicant, not a mere inconvenience;
      (3)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship;
      (4)   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his own making;
      (5)   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other tracts, and therefore, a variance would be a more
appropriate remedy than an amendment; and
      (6)   The variance, if granted, will not substantially impair
implementation of the Village Community Plan, including the Official Map.

PARKS LAND/CASH CONTRIBUTION
§ 151.80 INTENT; SCOPE.
   (A)   An intent of the subdivision code shall be to maintain the existing
high quality of life for present and future residents by preserving open spaces
for public parks without raising taxes and by placing the responsibility for
these services on the subdivision developments that create the need for
recreational and other open space and that cause the impact on existing
resources. The subsequent provisions are intended to provide the Village of
Millstadt with a financing mechanism for developing and maintaining a safe and
clean park system, which meets the recreational and leisure needs of the
residents of the village.
   (B)   As a condition of approval of any subdivision, as defined herein,
authorizing new residential lots or units, to the extent the requirements of
this code have not already been satisfied, within the corporate limits of the
village, or within the planning jurisdiction of the village (being one and one-
half miles outside the corporate limits), the subdivider shall dedicate real
property on-site, or equivalent real property off-site acceptable to the
village, or make a cash payment in lieu of land dedication, or a combination of
both, at the option of the village, for parks and open space to serve the
immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or
redevelopment. Such dedication or payment shall be (“land/cash contribution”)
in a total amount sufficient to satisfy the criteria and formula contained
within this code.
   (C)   Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the developer and village,
any land to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes shall be platted,
dedicated and improved as part of the first phase of any subdivision.
Dedication deeds and plats shall be in such a form as required by the Village
Attorney and required by the village for acceptance. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to require the village to accept any dedication of land until express
action by the village accepting such dedication for maintenance purposes.
(Ord. 1025, passed 4-20-09)
§ 151.81 COMPLIANCE.
   No subdivision approval for activity subject to this code shall be granted
without compliance to this code, except where it may otherwise be required by
law; provided, however, the “land/cash contribution” requirement established
herein shall not apply to any subdivision that has already received preliminary
plat approval by the village as of March 1, 2009 and for which the final plat
is thereafter consistent with the approved preliminary plat.
(Ord. 1025, passed 4-20-09)
§ 151.82 MINIMUM GREENSPACE REQUIREMENT.
   The minimum land/cash contribution requirement for each subdivision shall be
as follows:

         (a)   Single Family Residence Districts (R-l, R-2) - 4% of the total
area.
         (b)   Multi-Family Districts (R-3, R-4, R-5) - 8% of the total area.
         (c)   All other districts - 8% of the total area.

      (3)   Park sites shall be located in conjunction with and adjacent to
school sites whenever possible and desirable; and
      (4)   Community parks are intended to serve a broader area and should be
located and designed to offer a greater variety of facilities and activities.
These parks should typically be located on arterial or collector streets.
   (B)   Storm water and surface water detention or retention areas. Stormwater
and surface water detention and retention areas may be accepted at the

   (C)   Wetlands and other natural areas. Wetlands and other natural areas
will be considered acceptable only when they are considered significant in
size, quality, and uniqueness, contain endangered plants or animal species, or
are adjacent to existing natural areas currently owned by the village. Wetland
areas will be accepted at the discretion of the Village Board. Any such wetland
area accepted by the village shall not count toward the total land dedication
required herein; provided that exceptional wetland designs or accompanying
amenities may be given partial or full credit toward the land/cash contribution
requirements at the discretion of the Board.
   (D)   Dimensions. Sites shall be generally square to rectangular in shape
with dimensions generally proportionate to the ratio of depth of between one to
one and three to two (1:1 and 3:2). These criteria shall not apply to sites

retention in a non-disturbed state, each dedicated park site shall be graded to
drain at a minimum of 2% for open areas and slopes on berms, when berms are
required, and shall not exceed 4:1 (3:1 or steeper shall be deemed
unacceptable). Grading shall include, but not be limited to, berms for
separation, screening or aesthetics, placement of six inches of topsoil and
fine grading. Grading and berming shall be in accordance with plans approved by
the village.
   (C)   Other site developments. The developer shall be required to provide
other site developments for the land to be dedicated for park purposes, which
site developments shall include, but not be limited to, the following and be

by the village.
      (8)   The developer shall supply the village with a complete survey of

(Ord. 1025, passed 4-20-09)
§ 151.85 CRITERIA FOR A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK SITE.
   (A)   Where the development is small and the resulting park site is too
small to be practical or when no available land is appropriate for a park site
as determined by the village, the village may require the subdivider or the
developer to pay a cash contribution partly or wholly in lieu of land
dedication. A cash contribution in lieu of park site dedications shall be based
on acres of land on site improved as specified herein that otherwise would have
been dedicated as a park site. Such improvements shall include consideration of
grading, streets, water, and sewer systems, curbs and gutters, sidewalks,
electrical service, street trees and streetlights.
   (B)   The minimum cash contribution shall be $30,000 per acre.
(Ord. 1025, passed 4-20-09)
§ 151.86 LAND/CASH CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   The dedication of land required hereunder shall be made prior to the
final platting of 50% of the lots approved in the preliminary plat, and cash
contributions required hereunder shall be made on a pro-rata basis at the time
of application for a building permit for each lot in the development; provided
that if land dedication or fee in lieu obligations are not satisfied in full on
or before the date of the approval of the first final plat, then such
obligation shall be included in and secured by the improvement guarantee (bond
or irrevocable letter of credit) held by the village. Further, the dedications
or contributions required hereunder shall be applicable and due when a division
of property or development or redevelopment of property occurs which creates
lots or dwelling units in addition to the number of lots or dwelling units
existing as of the date these requirements are hereby established and in such
cases shall be paid upon application for a building permit for each additional
dwelling unit. In the case of land dedication, the developer shall agree to
maintain the property in accordance with all the laws of the village until such
time as the land is formally accepted by the village. Improvements to any
dedicated land shall be secured by a bond or letter of credit in an amount and
form acceptable to the village in its sole discretion at the time the final
plat is presented for approval.
   (B)   These requirements are not intended to apply to lands of subdividers
or developers who have entered into an agreement with the village for
annexation of land, or for the use of land in a planned development, where such
agreement would be violated by imposition of these requirements to such land;
provided that these requirements shall be fully enforceable against those lands
where the annexation agreement or the planned unit development agreement may
have expired and become void because the lands affected were not developed
within the time provided for in said agreements.
   (C)   Title insurance, survey, assessment plats. Each deed or other
instrument conveying land to the village shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   A commitment for a standard Form B ALTA owner’s policy of title
insurance issued by a title insurer licensed to do business in Illinois to
insure the village’s title to such real estate in an amount equal to its value
computed hereunder, subject only to the general real estate taxes which are not
due and payable at the time of delivery of the deed, covenants, conditions and
restrictions of record which do not prohibit or materially interfere with the
use of the subject real estate for park and recreational use;
      (2)   A current land survey of the subject real estate with all corners
staked, prepared by an Illinois registered land surveyor and certified to the
village as meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements of both an American
Land Title Association (ALTA) survey and the Illinois Land Survey Standards;
and
      (3)   Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed has
assigned to it a permanent index number or numbers which do not cover any other
real estate, an assessment plat and tax division petition in form acceptable to
the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be conveyed can be
assigned its own permanent real estate index number for exemption purposes. All
documents described herein shall be in form satisfactory to the village in its
sole discretion.

   (B)   Variations from masonry coverage requirements.  Notwithstanding the
exterior wall masonry building coverage requirements contained in the preceding
division (A), when by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of
property, which condition is not generally prevalent in the area, the strict
application of the requirements contained in division (A) above would result in
peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue
hardship upon the owner of such property, the owner may seek a variance by
filing an application for variance under §
152.211 of the Village's Zoning Code. In reviewing and granting a variance to a
property owner pursuant to the provisions herein, economic hardship caused to a
property owner resulting from the cost of exterior building wall masonry
construction as compared to the cost of alternative exterior building wall
material shall not be a factor to be considered by either the Zoning Board or
the Village Board. Such economic hardship caused to a particular property owner
shall not constitute a peculiar and exceptional practical difficulty or
exceptional and undue hardship upon the property owner justifying relief from
the strict application of the requirements of division (A) herein.
   (C)   Plat requirements.  Each preliminary subdivision plat and final
subdivision plat (including plats for subdivisions to be platted and developed
in phases or additions) submitted to the village for Village Board approval
shall depict on the plat drawing and shall state in a note or chart on the plat
which lots shall be restricted to a minimum of a full front facade masonry
exterior wall coverage, a minimum of 50% masonry exterior wall coverage
including a full front facade, and which lots shall be unrestricted as to a
masonry exterior wall requirement. For ease of reference, the following code
(or abbreviations) shall be depicted on the lots on the plat drawing and used
on the chart with reference to the subject restrictions:
      (1)   (MF) for full front facade masonry;
       (2)   (M50) for a minimum of 50% masonry including a full front facade;
      (3)   (MO) for unrestricted lots. Plat submittals which lack the number
of building lots to fully satisfy the exterior wall masonry restriction
percentages required by division (A) above, shall be required to favor the more
restrictive over the less restrictive or unrestrictive building lots exterior
wall masonry requirement. So that, for example:
         (a)   If there are only three building lots in a subdivision, two of
the building lots shall be subject to the minimum of a full front facade (MF)
masonry wall restriction and the remaining one building lot will not be subject
to an exterior wall masonry construction restriction (MO).
         (b)   If there are only five building lots in a subdivision, three of
the building lots shall be subject to the minimum of a full front facade (MF)
masonry wall restriction, one of the building lots shall be subject to the
minimum of the 50% masonry wall (M50) restriction including a full front
facade, and the remaining one building lot will not be subject to an exterior
wall masonry construction restriction (MO).
         (c)   If there are only six building lots in a subdivision, three of
the building lots shall be subject to the minimum of a full front facade (MF)
masonry wall restriction, two of the building lots shall be subject to the
minimum of the 50% masonry wall (M50) restriction including a full front
facade, and the remaining one building lot will not be subject to an exterior
wall masonry construction restriction.
      The application of the exterior wall masonry requirement percentages
required by division (A) above shall be determined by the number of lots in a
subdivision and not by the square footage of the bulk area of a subdivision or
by some other method of measurement. The developer shall be required to select
the location of the restricted and the unrestricted lots, in accordance with
the requirements of division (A) above, at the time of the developer's first
subdivision plat submittal to the village (that is, at the time of preliminary
plat submittal for other than minor subdivisions and at the time of final plat
submittal for minor subdivisions).
      The exterior wall masonry requirement restriction that attaches to each
building lot in a subdivision shall be a minimum construction requirement and
shall run with the land to which the restriction pertains. After final platting
of a subdivision, a restricted lot may be exchanged for an unrestricted lot or
less restricted lot in the subdivision as follows: The Village Building
Commissioner may approve, in writing, the transfer of a masonry coverage
requirement from a restricted lot to an unrestricted lot or a less restricted
lot provided the masonry coverage requirement of division (A) herein for the
subdivision shall continue to be maintained.

follows:
   Undertaking in Lieu of Completion Bond.
   WHEREAS, the statutes of the State of Illinois grant to a municipal
corporation the right to require that a developer constructing certain
improvements within that community guarantee the construction of such
improvements by a completion bond or other security acceptable to the
community; and
   WHEREAS,                                           desires to construct a
residential development within the                       of

engineering costs as shall be required to meet with his approval. In aiding the
municipal engineer in determining the amount of reasonably anticipated costs
for the construction of such improvements, the OWNER may submit to the engineer
signed contracts for the construction of such improvements. The municipal
engineer, upon being satisfied that the design of the required improvements are
in accordance with the ordinances of the MUNICIPALITY and in accordance with
good engineering practices, shall estimate and certify an amount which shall
represent one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the reasonably estimated cost
of completing the required improvements for which the MUNICIPALITY is requiring
a completion guarantee.
   4.   [THAT except for the issuance of building permits for a reasonable
number of models], the OWNER shall not be entitled to the issuance of [further]
building permits until and unless said OWNER shall submit to the MUNICIPALITY,
an irrevocable financial commitment from a bank, savings and loan, or mortgage
company approved by the MUNICIPALITY in the amount certified by the Municipal
Engineer.
   5.   THAT the written irrevocable financial commitment shall be furnished to
the MUNICIPALITY from a banking or lending institution in the form marked

§ 152.044 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Definition. For the purpose of this chapter, PLANNED DEVELOPMENT “PD”
shall mean a development wherein, in accordance with an approved development
plan, common open space is reserved, various housing types and other structures
and uses may be mixed, and/or overall average density does not exceed the usual
zoning district limit.
   (B)   Objectives. This section authorizes development of planned
developments and establishes procedures in order to achieve the objectives
enumerated at §
152.002 and the following additional objectives:
      (1)   To provide a regulatory mechanism whereby the village can be
assured that upon completion, approved development projects will substantially
conform to the plans or models which constituted the basis for the issuance of
the necessary zoning and subdivision permits.
      (2)   To permit development of a wide variety of housing types and other
structures and uses in a single comprehensively planned project;
      (3)   To preserve the natural topography, scenic features, mature trees,
and historic structures existing on sites proposed for development;
      (4)   To encourage innovative site layouts and coordinated architectural
treatment of different housing types and other structures;
      (5)   To ensure the provision of usable common open space in planned
developments, and to spur installation of various amenities therein;
      (6)   To facilitate the economical installation of standard streets,
sewers, utilities and other improvements.
   (C)   Compliance with provisions. Except as specifically provided otherwise
in this section, planned developments, including all structures and uses
therein, shall, at a minimum, be built in conformity with all applicable codes
and ordinances including this chapter and
Chapter 151, Subdivision Code.
   (D)   Districts where allowed. Planned developments may be built in any
zoning district, but only upon the issuance of a special use permit by the
Village Board after a hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals. (See §
152.212(A))
   (E)   Permissible deviation from code requirements. The planned development
concept is intended to afford both the developer and the village considerable
flexibility in formulating development proposals. Consequently, to the extent
indicated in this section, Planned Developments may deviate from generally
applicable code requirements without a variance. Any proposed deviation not
listed below, however, shall require a variance.
      (1)   Mixed uses. Planned developments may include all types of
residential structures and any other uses approved by the Village Board,
provided, that in approving such mixed uses, the Village Board may attach any
conditions necessary to protect the public welfare.
      (2)   Lot and structure requirements. In Planned Development the Village
Board may approve any reasonable deviation from the lot and structure
requirements of the particular zoning district so long as the different uses
within the “PD” are appropriately interrelated and property abutting the “PD”
is adequately protected from any potential adverse impacts of the development.
LOT AND STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS shall mean minimum individual lot area, width,
and depth; minimum setbacks; and maximum structure height.
      (3)   Accessory uses. In “PD” the Village Board may allow the developer
to disregard the usual restrictions on accessory uses other than the
prohibition against using an accessory structure as a dwelling.
      (4)   Location of parking/loading spaces. By permission of the Village
Board, off-street parking and loading spaces in planned developments need not
be located in accordance with generally applicable requirements. The minimum
number of such spaces, however, shall not be less than the number required as
per §
152.115 through
152.122.
   (F)   Procedures for planned developments.
      (1)   Required procedures. Every applicant for planned development
approval shall comply with the procedural requirements of this section. The

written report recommending acceptance or rejection of the development plan. In
recommending what their decision should be, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider the following criteria:
         (a)   The extent to which the proposed development is consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan and with the purposes of this chapter and of all other
applicable codes and ordinances;
         (b)   The extent to which the proposed development deviates from the
regulations that are generally applicable to the property (including but not
limited to, the use and lot and building regulations of the district), and the
apparent merits (if any) of the deviations;

   (H)   Failure to begin development. If a substantial amount of construction
has not begun within the time stated in the approved construction schedule, the
development plan shall lapse upon written notice to the applicant from the
Zoning Administrator and shall be of no further effect. However, in his
discretion and for good cause, the Zoning Administrator may extend for a
reasonable time the period for the beginning of construction. If a final
development plan lapses as per this section:
      (1)   The special use permit shall be automatically revoked;

NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES
§ 152.175 PURPOSE.
   The requirements imposed by this chapter are designed to guide the use of
land by encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible
with the predominant character of each of the various districts. Lots,
structures and uses of land or structures that do not conform to the
requirements of the district in which they are located tend to impede
appropriate development. For example, nonconformities are frequently
responsible for heavy traffic on residential streets, the overtaxing of parking
facilities, the creation of nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values.
The regulations of this subchapter are intended to alleviate such existing/
potential problems by encouraging the gradual elimination of nonconformities.
(Ord. 491, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.176 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Any vacant lot that does not conform to one or more of the lot size

changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use shall not
thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use. If no structural alterations
are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification.
   (D)   Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a
period of 12 consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be resumed, and any

§ 152.206 INITIAL CERTIFICATES OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.
   Upon the effective date of this chapter, no lot shall be created, no land
shall be developed, no new use or structure shall be established or erected,
and no existing use or structure shall be enlarged, extended, altered,
relocated or reconstructed until an initial certificate of zoning compliance
has been issued. The Administrator shall not issue an initial certificate of

applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Application. Every applicant for an initial certificate of zoning
compliance shall submit to the Administrator, in graphic and/or narrative form,
all the items of information listed below that are applicable to the particular
project. The Administrator shall decide which items are applicable. (Note:
Filing fee required). Items of information are as follows:

require.
   (B)   Duration of certificate. Initial certificates of zoning compliance
shall be valid for one year, or until revoked for failure to abide by a
corrective action order. The Administrator may renew initial certificates of
zoning compliance for successive one-year periods upon written request,
provided the applicant is making a good faith effort to complete the authorized
work.
   (C)   Relationship to building permits. Upon the effective date of this
chapter, no building permit for the erection, enlargement, extension,
alteration, or reconstruction of any structure shall be issued until the

this chapter, and no structure or use, or part thereof, that has been erected,
enlarged, altered, relocated or reconstructed after the effective date of this
chapter shall be used, occupied, or put into operation until a final
certificate of zoning compliance has been issued. The Administrator shall not
issue a final certificate of zoning compliance until it has been determined, by
inspection, that the work authorized by the initial certificate of zoning
compliance has been completed in accordance with approved plans. Failure to
obtain a final certificate of zoning compliance shall constitute a separate
violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 491, passed 6-16-86) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.208 CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDERS.
   Whenever the Zoning Administrator finds, by inspection or otherwise, that
any lot, structure, or use, or work thereon, is in violation of this chapter,
the Zoning Administrator shall so notify the responsible party, and shall order
appropriate corrective action.
   (A)   Contents of order. The order to take corrective action shall be in
writing and shall include:
      (1)   A description of the premises sufficient for identification;
      (2)   A statement indicating the nature of the violation;
      (3)   A statement of the remedial action necessary to effect compliance;
      (4)   The date by which the violation must be corrected;
      (5)   A statement that the alleged violator is entitled to a conference
with the Administrator if he so desires;
      (6)   The date by which an appeal of the corrective action order must be
filed, and a statement of the procedure for so filing; and
      (7)   A statement that failure to obey a corrective action order shall
result in revocation of the certificate of zoning compliance and may result in
the imposition of fines.
   (B)   Service of order. A corrective action order shall be deemed properly
served upon the owner, occupant or operator of the offending lot, structure or
use if it is:
      (1)   Served upon him personally;
      (2)   Sent by certified mail to his last known address; or
      (3)   Posted in a conspicuous place on or about the affected premises.
   (C)   Stop orders. Whenever any work is being done in violation of an
initial certificate of zoning compliance, the Administrator's corrective action
order may state that the violation must cease immediately, (see division (A) of
this section). In such case, the corrective action order is equivalent to a
stop order.
(Ord. 491, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.209 EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever the
Administrator determines that any violation of this chapter poses an imminent
peril to life or property, he may institute, without notice or hearing, any
necessary proceedings to alleviate the perilous condition.
(Ord. 491, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.210 APPEALS.

filed, the Administrator shall transmit to the Board of Appeals all records
pertinent to the case. (Note: Filing fee required.)
   (B)   Stay of further proceedings. An appeal stays all further action on the
matter being appealed unless the Administrator certifies to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that for reasons
stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, further action shall not be stayed unless the Board of
Zoning Appeals or the circuit court grants a restraining order for due cause,
and so notifies the Administrator.
   (C)   Public hearing; notice. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a
public hearing on every appeal within a reasonable time after the filing of the
appeal notice. At the hearing any interested party may appear and testify,
either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice indicating the

recommend to the Board of Trustees for their decision and opinion on the Appeal
within a reasonable time after the hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals, in
their opinion to the Board of Trustees, may recommend to reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or to modify or amend the decision or order appealed from to
the extent and in the manner that they deem appropriate. In so performing their
duties, the Board of Zoning Appeals has all the powers of the Administrator.
   (E)   Decision by Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall render a
decision on the appeal within 60 days after receiving the appropriate records
and recommendation of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Trustees may
uphold the recommendation of the Board of Zoning Appeals and pass an ordinance
stipulating the facts.

§ 152.211 VARIANCES.
   A variance is a relaxation of the requirements of this chapter that are
applicable to a particular lot or structure. A so-called, use variance (which
would allow a use that is neither permitted nor special in the district in
question) is not a variance, it is an amendment, and may be granted only as
provided for at §
152.213.
   (A)   Application. Every application for a variance shall be filed with the
Administrator on a prescribed form. Every variance application shall also be
filed with the Soil and Water Agricultural District as per ILCS Ch. 70, Act
405, § 22.02a. The Administrator shall promptly transmit said application,
together with any device he might wish to offer, to the Board of Zoning
Appeals. The application shall contain sufficient information to allow the
Board to make an informed decision, and shall include, at a minimum, the
following: (Note: Filling fee required.)
      (1)   Name and address of the applicant;
      (2)   Location of the structure/use for which the variance is sought;
      (3)   Brief description of adjacent lots, structures, and/or uses;
      (4)   Brief description of the problem(s)/circumstances engendering the
variance request;
      (5)   Brief, but specific, statement/explanation of the desired variance;
      (6)   Specific section(s) of this chapter containing the regulations
which, if strictly applied, would cause a serious problem; and
      (7)   Any other pertinent information that the Administrator may require.
   (B)   Public hearing; notice. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a
public hearing on each variance request within a reasonable time after the
variance application is submitted to them. At the hearing any interested party
may appear and testify either in person or by duly authorized agent or
attorney. Notice indicating the time, date, and place of the hearing, and the
nature of the proposed variance shall be given not more than 30 nor less than
15 days before the hearing:
      (1)   By first class mail to the applicant and to all parties whose
property is within 250 feet of the property affected by the proposed variance;
and
      (2)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
village.
   (C)   Advisory report; findings of fact. Within a reasonable time after the
public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall submit their advisory report
to the Village Board. The report shall state the Board of Appeals'
recommendations regarding the proposed variance. The Board of Appeals shall not
recommend any variance unless, based upon the evidence presented to them, they
determine that:
      (1)   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this chapter (see §
152.002);
      (2)   Strict application of the district requirements would result in
great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, and prevent a
reasonable return on the property;
      (3)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship, and allow a
reasonable return on the property;
      (4)   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his own making;
      (5)   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other property within the district, and therefore, that a
variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (rezoning); and
      (6)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the area where the premises in question are located nor materially frustrate
implementation of this municipality's comprehensive plan.
   (D)   Action by Village Board. The Village Board shall act on every proposed
variance at their next regularly scheduled meeting following submission of the
Board of Appeals advisory report. Without further public hearing, the Village
Board may approve or disapprove any proposed variance by simple majority vote
of all the members then holding office. Approved variances shall be supported
in the form of a village ordinance.

§ 152.212 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Special use permits. This chapter divides the village into various
districts, and permits in each district as a matter of right only those uses
which are clearly compatible with one another. Certain other uses, because of
their special operational or physical characteristics, may or may not have a
detrimental impact on nearby permitted uses, depending upon their precise
location, manner of operation and other factors. Such special uses require
careful case-by-case review, and may be allowed only after review and approved
by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (B)   Application. Every applicant for a special use permit shall submit to
the Zoning Administrator in narrative and/or graphic form, the items of
information enumerated below. The Administrator shall promptly transmit the
completed application, together with any comments or recommendation he might
have, to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (Note: Filing fee required.) Items of
information are as follows:
      (1)   Name and address of the applicant;
      (2)   Name and address of the owner or operator of the proposed structure
or use, if different from division (B)(1) above;
      (3)   Nature of the proposed use, including type of activity, manner of
operation, number of occupants or employees, and similar matters;
      (4)   Location of the proposed use or structure, and its relationship to
existing uses of structures on adjacent lots;
      (5)   Area and dimensions of the site for the proposed structure or use;
      (6)   Existing topography of the site and proposed finished grade;
      (7)   Existing and proposed screening, landscaping and erosion control
features on the site, including the parking area;
      (8)   Height and setbacks of the proposed structure;
      (9)   Number and size of proposed dwelling units, if any;
      (10)    Number and location of proposed parking/loading spaces and access
ways;
      (11)    Identification and location of all existing or proposed
utilities, whether public or private; and/or
      (12)    Any other pertinent information that the Administrator may
require.
   (C)   Public hearing; notice. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a
public hearing on every special use permit application within a reasonable time
after the application is submitted to them. At the hearing any interested party
may appear and testify, either in person or by duly authorized agent or
attorney. Notice indicating the time, date, and place of the hearing, and the
nature of the proposed special use shall be given not more than 30 nor less
than 15 days before the hearing:
      (1)   By first class mail to applicant and to all parties whose property
is within 250 feet of the lot line of the proposed special use; and
      (2)   By publication in a newspaper published within this village.
   (D)   Advisory report, factors considered. Within a reasonable time after
the public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall submit their advisory
report to the village. In deciding what their advice should be, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the proposed design, location and manner of operation of
the proposed special use will adequately protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, and the physical environment;
      (2)   Whether the proposed special use is consistent with this
municipality's comprehensive plan, if any;
      (3)   The effect the proposed special use would have on the value of
neighboring property and on this municipality's overall tax base;
      (4)   The effect the proposed special use would have on public utilities
and on traffic circulation on nearby streets; and
      (5)   Whether there are any facilities near the proposed special use
(such as schools or hospitals) that require special protection.
   (E)   Action by Village Board. The Village Board shall act on every request
for a special use permit at their next regularly scheduled meeting following
submission of the Board of Zoning Appeals advisory. A village ordinance will be
passed for approved special use permits.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
§ 152.300 PURPOSE.
   (A)   General purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to provide specific
regulations for the placement, construction and modification of
telecommunications facilities. The provisions of this subchapter are not
intended and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the
provisions of this subchapter be applied in such a manner to unreasonably
discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless
services.
      (1)   The goals of this subchapter are:
         (a)   To enhance the ability to provide telecommunications services to
the village.
         (b)   To encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas.
         (c)   Minimize the total number of towers in the village.
         (d)   Encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites.
         (e)   Encourage users of towers to locate and configure them in a way
that minimizes adverse visual impact.
      (2)   Accordingly, the Board of Trustees finds that the promulgation of
this subchapter is warranted and necessary:
         (a)   To accommodate the growing need for communications facilities;
         (b)   To manage the location of communications facilities in the
village;
         (c)   To promote and encourage shared use co-location of existing and
new communications towers as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers, and to reduce the number of such structures
needed in the future;
         (d)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impacts of communications towers, including support structure failure
and falling ice;
         (e)   To minimize adverse visual impacts of communications facilities
through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
   (B)   Technical consultation. Should the need arise where professional
technical consultation is necessary, the Village Zoning Administrator is
authorized, at his or her discretion, to employ on behalf of the village an
independent technical expert to review any technical materials submitted
including, but not limited to, those required under this subchapter and in
those case where a technical demonstration of unavoidable need or
unavailability of alternatives is required. The applicant shall pay all the
costs of the review, including any administrative costs incurred by the
village. To protect the applicant, any proprietary information disclosed to the
village, or to the expert hired, shall remain confidential and shall not be
disclosed to any third party.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.301 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, certain terms or words used herein are
hereby defined as follows:

(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.302 USES ALLOWED.
   (A)   Compliance. All new telecommunications facilities shall comply with
this subchapter upon the date of passage. All telecommunications facilities
existing on the date of passage of this subchapter shall be allowed to continue
their usage as they presently exist and in accordance with continuance of
nonconformity regulations. New construction, other than routine maintenance, on
existing telecommunications facilities shall comply with the requirements of
this document, although the governing authority may waive or reduce the burden
on the applicant of one or more of the requirements, if in the sole discretion
of the governing authority, the goals of this subchapter are better served
thereby.
   (B)   Authorization. In all districts communication facilities shall be
permitted only if specifically authorized with a special use permit by the
President and Board of Trustees of the village, upon recommendations by the
Zoning Board of Appeals. In granting a special use permit, the governing
authority may impose zoning conditions to the extent the governing authority
concludes such conditions are necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any
adverse effect of the proposed telecommunications facility on adjoining
properties.
   (C)   Agreement. No approval granted hereunder shall be effective until the
applicant and the village have executed a written agreement setting forth the
particular terms and provisions under which the approval to occupy and use
public ways of the village will be granted. Such agreement shall provide for
complete indemnification for the village and also provide for such liability
insurance as the village may require.
   (D)   Nonexclusive grant. No approval granted under this subchapter shall
confer any exclusive right, privilege, license or franchise to occupy or use
the public ways of the village for delivery of telecommunications services or
any other purposes.
   (E)   Rights granted.  No approval granted under this subchapter shall
convey any right, title or interest in the public ways, but shall be deemed
approval only to use and occupy the public ways for the limited purpose and
terms stated in the approval. Further, no approval shall construed as any
warranty of title.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.303 REGISTRATION AND PERMITS.
   (A)   Registration and fee.
      (1)   All telecommunications carriers and providers that offer or provide
any telecommunications service for a fee directly to the public within the
village or outside the corporate limits from telecommunications facilities
within the village, shall register with the village pursuant to this subchapter
on forms provided by the village, which shall include:
         (a)   The identity and legal status of the registrant, including any
affiliates.
         (b)   The name, address and telephone number of the officer, agent or
employee responsible for the accuracy of the registration statement.
         (c)   All of the information listed below for a permit.
      (2)   Each application for registration as a telecommunications carrier
or provider shall be accompanied by a fee of $500.
   (B)   Permit. A proper building permit must be obtained for any
telecommunications facility installation. Applications for special use permit,
planned unit development approval and building permit shall include any
combination of site plans, surveys, maps, technical reports or written
narratives necessary to convey the following information:
      (1)   A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and height
of any proposed communications facility, on site land uses and zoning, adjacent
land uses and zoning, adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, set backs
from property lines, elevation drawings of the proposed facilities and any
other structures.
      (2)   Map and/or aerial photograph showing the proposed facility location
and surrounding areas within 1,500 feet.
      (3)   Legal description of the property proposed for telecommunications
facility.
      (4)   Exact distances, locations and identifications of surrounding
residential properties and other telecommunications facilities.
      (5)   A landscape plan in compliance with the village code.
      (6)   Method of fencing, color of facilities, and where applicable, the
method of camouflage and illumination.
      (7)   Plans must be completed and sealed by a professional engineer
registered with the state and must include a statement that the facilities will
comply with the Electronic Industries Associations standard and all village
building and construction codes.
      (8)   A statement by the applicant on the ability of the construction of
the facility to accommodate the co-location of additional antenna
installations.
      (9)   Any telecommunications company must demonstrate that it is licensed
by the FCC.
      (10)   The applicant must demonstrate how the proposed site fits into its
overall network within the village and plans must include any expected future
facilities desired to be constructed within the village.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.304 CO-LOCATION AND ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   Co-location.
      (1)   Co-location of communications antennas is desired to minimize
adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
communications facilities. Co-location of communications facilities by more
than one carrier on existing or new antenna support structures shall take
precedence over the construction of new single use communication facilities. An
applicant for a new antenna support structure shall demonstrate that a diligent
effort has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities in
accordance with the site selection and protocol requirements of this subchapter
and that, due to valid considerations including physical restraints and
economic or technological feasibility, no more appropriate location is
available. The telecommunications company is required to demonstrate that it
contacted, in writing, the owners of tall structures within a 1,500 foot radius
of the site proposed, asked for permission to install the antenna on those
structures, and was denied in writing, for reasons other than economic ones.
The village may deny the application to construct a new facility if the
applicant has not made a diligent effort, described in writing, to mount the
antenna on an existing structure.
      (2)   In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed
in the village in the future, any new proposed support structure shall be
designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the applicant
demonstrates in writing why such design is unfeasible for technical or physical
reasons. Unless co-location has been demonstrated to be unfeasible, the site
plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower to be used for the
placement of additional equipment/buildings for other users.
   (B)   Abandonment. In the event the use of any communications facility has
been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the facility shall be
deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made
by the Village Zoning Administrator, who shall have the right to request
documentation and/or affidavits from the communications facility owner/operator
regarding the issue of facility usage. Upon such abandonment the owner/operator
of the facility shall have 90 days to reactivate the use of the facility,
transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the
facility, or dismantle and remove the facility. If there are two or more users
of a single facility, then this provision shall not become effective until all
users cease using the facility. When a facility has been abandoned and removed,
the Village Board of Trustees will take necessary action to vacate any previous
special use or planned unit development approval for the particular abandoned
facility.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.305 SITE SELECTION AND PROTOCOLS.
   (A)   Site selection.
      (1)   As a fundamental element of this subchapter, the telecommunications
company proposing to construct an antenna support structure or mount an antenna
on an existing structure is required to demonstrate, using technological
evidence, that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order to satisfy its
function in the company’s grid system. Further, the company must demonstrate by
technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height
necessary to fulfill the communications facilities function in the grid system.
      (2)   Given the unquestioned visual impact of communications towers on
their surrounding environment, no antenna support structure may be constructed
on a speculative basis. Applications for necessary permits will only be
processed when the applicant has in place agreements with an FCC licensed
telecommunications provider for lease/utilization of the support structure
space, written proof of which must be offered by the applicant.
      (3)   (a)   Telecommunications facilities must be located and designed to
minimize any adverse effect they may have on residential property values. Sites
shall be placed in locations where the existing topography, vegetation,
buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening.
Location and design of all sites shall consider the impact of the site on the
surrounding neighborhood. In residential districts and residential land use
areas, the minimum lot size for commercial communications tower shall be three
acres, except for government owned properties.
         (b)   Specific locations will be evaluated using the following
criteria which are not listed in order of priority:
            1.   Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for
optimum efficiency in service.
            2.   Availability of road access.
            3.   Availability of electrical power.
            4.   Availability of land based telephone lines or microwave link
capability.
            5.   Leasable lands and landlords who want facilities to be located
on their property.
            6.   Screening of potential and existing vegetation, structures and
topographic features.
            7.   Compatibility with adjacent land uses.
            8.   The least number of sites to cover the desired area.
            9.   The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical
requirements.
            10.   Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact.
            11.   Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna
mounting.
   (B)   Protocols. The following establishes the planning order of priorities
for locating new communications facilities:
      (1)   Place towers and antennas on commercial or government property.
      (2)   Place towers and antennas on other non-residential property.
      (3)   Place antennas on other appropriate existing structures such as
buildings, communication towers, water towers and smoke stacks.
      (4)   Place new communication towers in residential districts only if
locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not available on existing
structures or in non-residential districts. The telecommunications company is
required to demonstrate that it contacted, in writing, the owners of other more
appropriate properties and was denied, in writing, for reasons other than
economic ones.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.306 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The following is a list of design criteria:
   (A)   New communications facilities shall be located in accordance with the
site selection and protocol requirements of this subchapter and shall be
designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user. All facilities must be
architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and land uses or
otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the
existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. All facilities
must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and
any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate such
facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of
the communications facilities shall bring those facilities into compliance with
the revised standards and regulations within three months of the effective date
of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent schedule is mandated
by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring facilities into compliance
with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the
removal of the facility.
   (B)   All telecommunications facilities must be located on properties that
comply with the lot area requirements of the zoning code. Additionally, any
telecommunications facility located in a residential zoning district must be
located on a lot with a minimum size of three acres.
   (C)   All communications facilities must be separated from communications
facilities on other properties by at least 1,500 feet.
   (D)   The maximum height for any antenna support structure shall be 150 feet
upon property zoned heavy commercial, 120 feet on property zoned light
commercial, and 100 feet on all other properties, unless additional height is
approved by variation by the President and Board of Trustees after a proper
public hearing and recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals in the event
of a planned unit development amendment.
   (E)   All antenna support structures must be set back a distance equal to
their height from any property line. At a minimum, any such antenna tower shall
provide a lot line setback at least equal to one-half of its height from the
antenna to all adjoining residential property lines.
   (F)   Communications towers shall have a non-contrasting blue, grey, or
black finish, or a similar color that minimizes their visibility, unless a
different color is required by the FCC or FAA.
   (G)   All telecommunications facilities shall be lighted only if required by
the FCC or the FAA. Where tower lighting is required, it shall be shielded or
directed to the greatest extent possible in such a manner as to minimize the
amount of light that falls onto nearby properties, particularly residences. A
manually-operated or motion detection light above the equipment shed door is
permitted but shall be kept off except when personnel are actually present at
night.
   (H)   Communications towers shall be constructed in accordance with
standards of the Electronic Industries Association and all applicable
construction and building codes, as may be amended from time to time.
Surrounding areas shall not be negatively affected by support structure
failure, falling ice or other debris or interference. All support structures
shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices as approved by the manufacturers.
   (I)   Building mounted facilities must be architecturally compatible with
the building on which they are mounted and designed and located so as to
minimize any adverse aesthetic impact. Any support structure or mechanical
equipment must be screened or enclosed in such a manner as to mask such
equipment. Such screening shall be of noncombustible material and of the same
color, character and design as the building upon which the screening is
erected. An antenna must be mounted to the wall of a building or extend above
the roof of a building without the screening, provided the antenna is painted
or otherwise made to match the color of the building or structure or background
against which they are most commonly seen. Communications facilities shall not
occupy more than an aggregate total of 10% of the roof area of any building.
   (J)   Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing
character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation must be
preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site
must be minimized. All ground mounted facilities and equipment shall be
enclosed with a solid six foot high fence. Landscaping shall be required to
screen as much of the support structure as possible, the fence surrounding the
support structure and any other ground level features, and in general soften
the appearance of the facility. As a condition of permit the village may set
conditions concerning existing vegetation, topography, walls, fences or other
landscaping to achieve an acceptable degree of screening.
   (K)   Driveways and parking areas constructed in compliance with village
code must be provided as necessary for each telecommunications facility. If any
site is not automated, the number of required parking spaces shall equal the
number of people on the largest shift. Any security fencing must be of a color
and design to blend into the character of the existing environment.
   (L)   No telecommunications facility shall cause interference with the
reception of television and radio broadcasts to the property on which they are
located or to surrounding properties.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.307 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following are considered exemptions:
   (A)   Proposed communications antennas may, and are encouraged to, co-locate
onto existing approved structures. Provided such co-locations are accomplished
in a manner consistent with the terms of this subchapter, then such co-
locations may be approved without any new or additional special use or planned
unit development approval. Proper plans must be submitted and permits obtained
for such co-location facilities as required by this subchapter.
   (B)   Any communications facilities on properties owned by the village are
exempt from the terms of this subchapter subject to any conditions set by the
President and Board of Trustees of the village.
   (C)   Nothing in the code shall apply to "receive only" communications
facilities for use by an individual residential dwelling unit or business,
provided such facilities comply with the height requirements of the zoning
district in which they are located.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.308 SEVERABILITY AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION.
   (A)   Severability. The provisions of this subchapter are hereby declared to
be severable and should any provision, clause, sentence, paragraph, sub-
paragraph, section, or part of this subchapter be determined to be in conflict
with any law, statute or regulation by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
provision shall be excluded and deemed inoperative, unenforceable, and as
though not provided for herein, and all other provisions shall remain
unaffected, unimpaired, valid and in full force and effect. It is hereby
declared to be the legislative intent of the village that this subchapter would
have been adopted had such unconstitutional or invalid provision, clause,
sentence, paragraph, sub-paragraph, section or part thereof not been included.
   (B)   Conflict resolution. All code provisions, ordinances, resolutions and
orders, or parts thereof, in conflict herewith, are to the extent of such
conflict hereby superseded.
(Ord. 807, passed 10-2-02)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who is convicted of a violation of this chapter shall be
fined not less than $50 nor more than $500, plus costs. Each day that a
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
   (B)   Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the village from
taking any other lawful action that may be necessary to secure compliance with
this chapter.

   (A) These regulations shall be known as the “Commercial Property Maintenance
Code”, hereinafter referred to as the “Property Maintenance Code” or “this
code.”
   (B)   This code is to establish minimum acceptable standards in the village
which must be maintained in buildings, structures, premises and facilities to
protect health, safety and general welfare.
(Ord. 1246, passed 11-22-21)
§ 154.02 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this code shall apply to all nonresidential structures and
all premises and constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises,
structures, equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating,
sanitation, protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and
other hazards, and for safe and sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of
owners, operators and occupants; the occupancy of existing structures and
premises, and for administration, enforcement and penalties.
(Ord. 1246, passed 11-22-21)
§ 154.03 INTENT.
   This code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent, which is to
ensure public health, safety and welfare in so far as they are affected by the
continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. Existing
structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be
altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required
herein.
(Ord. 1246, passed 11-22-21)
§ 154.04 SEVERABILITY.
   If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this code is, for
any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this code.
(Ord. 1246, passed 11-22-21)
§ 154.05 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   General. The provisions of this code shall apply to all matters
affecting or relating to structures and premises. Where, in a specific case,
different sections of this code specify different requirements, the most
restrictive shall govern.

this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good
working order. No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service,
facility, equipment or utility, which is required under this section, to be
removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any occupied structure,
except for such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or
alterations are in progress. The requirements of this code are not intended to
provide the basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety
systems and devices in existing structures. Except as otherwise specified
herein, the owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings,
structures and premises.
   (C)   Workmanship. Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations
which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall
be executed and installed in a workmanlike manner and installed in accordance
with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
   (D)   Historic buildings. The provisions of this code shall not be mandatory
for existing buildings or structures designated as historic buildings when such

safe and deviation from the requirements of this code is in the public
interest.
   (E)   Requirements not covered by code. Requirements necessary for the
strength, stability or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or
equipment, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not
specifically covered by this code, shall be determined by the Building
Inspector/Code Administrator.
(Ord. 1246, passed 11-22-21)
§ 154.06 EFFECT ON EXISTING ORDINANCES; REMEDIES.
   (A)   This code establishes minimum requirements for the initial and

replace or modify requirements otherwise established by ordinance which may be
additional or more stringent for the construction, repair, alteration or use of
structures, equipment or facilities.
   (B)   The provisions in this code shall not be construed to prevent the
enforcement of other ordinances or regulations which prescribe standards
stricter than are provided herein.

removal or demolition of any buildings which are deemed to be dangerous, unsafe

or regulations existing prior to the effective date hereof, and any such

structure and its premises will give the Building Inspector/Code Administrator
free access thereto, within and at a reasonable time, for the purpose of such

Mayor or his or her designee who shall then issue a certificate of building
maintenance and occupancy. The certificate shall certify compliance with the
provisions of this code, shall state the street address or other means of
identification, date of issue, and such other information as the Building
Inspector/Code Administrator shall deem appropriate for the implementation of
this code.

occupancy. However, no conditional permit shall be issued when there is a
condition on the premises which can threaten the health or safety of an
occupant.
(Ord. 1246, passed 11-22-21)
