as village trustees and the village president, and referred to in this section
as "members"), may participate in and vote electronically at public meetings of
the village board, in accordance with this section.
   B.   Conditions: A member may attend a meeting electronically if the member
meets the following conditions:
      1.   The member shall notify the village clerk at least six (6) hours
before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements shall result in denial of a request for remote attendance.
      2.   The member shall assert one of the following three (3) reasons why
he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         a.   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or

business related to their duties with the village of Pawnee; or
         c.   The member cannot attend because of a family or other major
emergency.
         d.   Personal trips, vacations, or personal convenience shall not
constitute a valid reason for electronic attendance, such actions being at
variance with the intent of the open meetings act 1 .
   C.   Authorization To Participate:
      1.   Request For Electronic Attendance: The village clerk, after
receiving the electronic attendance request, shall promptly inform the village
president or person expected to be the presiding officer at such meeting of the
request for electronic attendance.
      2.   Notice: After establishing that there is a quorum physically present
at a meeting where the member desires to attend electronically, the presiding
officer shall state and the minutes shall record that a notice was received
from the member in accordance with this section.
      3.   Authorization And Declaration: The member shall be deemed authorized
to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to the member's
electronic attendance is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds (2/3) of
the members physically present at the meeting. If no such motion is made and
seconded, or if any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by the
members physically present at the meeting, then the request by the member to
attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed approved by the village board
and the presiding officer shall declare the requesting member present. After
such declaration by the presiding officer, the question of a member's
electronic attendance may not be reconsidered.
      4.   Adequate Equipment Required: The member participating electronically
and members participating in person must be able to communicate effectively.
Further, the village shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that members of
the audience are able to hear all communication and votes of the member. Before
allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the village board shall provide
equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
      5.   Minutes: Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting, if
the member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and
state specifically whether each member is physically present or present by
electronic means. A member actually attending electronically shall not count
towards a quorum.
      6.   Rights Of Remote Member: A member permitted to attend electronically
shall be entitled to express his or her comments during the meeting and
participate in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject
to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered
to. The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted
as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending
electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote
counted and recorded by the village clerk and placed in the minutes for the
corresponding meeting. A member attending electronically may leave a meeting
and return as in the case of any member, provided the member attending
electronically shall announce his or her leaving and returning.
      7.   Attendance Form: The village board shall create an attendance form
for use as a request for electronic participation and/or for a record of the
member's e-mail, telefax, or telephone request. (Ord. 10-04, 3-8-2010)

hereby designated as deputy FOIA officer for FOIA requests involving the police
department and the village attorney is designated as deputy FOIA officer in the
place and stead of the FOIA officer if the FOIA officer is unavailable. Except
in instances when records are furnished immediately, the FOIA officer, or
designee, shall receive requests submitted to the village under this chapter
and issue responses accordingly. All village officers and employees who receive
an FOIA request from any source whatsoever shall notify the FOIA officer within
one working day. If the FOIA officer is not available, the village attorney
shall be notified.
Upon receiving a request for a public record, the FOIA officer shall:

   B.   Compute the day on which the period for response will expire and make a
notation of that date on the written request;
   C.   Maintain an electronic or paper copy of a written request, including
all documents submitted with the request until the request has been complied
with or denied; and
   D.   Create a file for the retention of the original request, a copy of the

other communications.
The village FOIA officer and deputies shall, by July 1, 2010, successfully
complete an electronic training curriculum to be developed by the public access
counselor and thereafter successfully complete an annual training program.
Thereafter, whenever a new FOIA officer is designated by the village, that
person shall successfully complete the electronic training curriculum within
thirty (30) days after assuming the position. Successful completion of the
required training curriculum within the periods provided shall be a
prerequisite to continue serving as an FOIA officer. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-6: REQUESTS TO BE IN WRITING:
All requests for inspection or copying of public records shall be in writing
and shall be addressed to the FOIA officer. The requester shall include the
following information in any request for public records:
   A.   The requester's full name, mailing address and telephone number at
which the requester can be reached during normal business hours;
   B.   A description of the records sought, as specific as possible;
   C.   An indication of whether the records are requested for a commercial
purpose and whether the requester seeks a fee waiver; and
   D.   A statement as to whether the request is for inspection, copying, or
both.
The FOIA officer shall make available a form for use by requesters; however, no
request shall be denied for failure to use the form.
All requests for inspection and copying received by the village shall
immediately be forwarded to its FOIA officer or designee. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-
2010)
1-10-7: FEES:
   A.   The village hereby establishes and shall charge fees reasonably
calculated to reimburse its actual cost for reproducing and certifying public
records and for the use, by any person, of the equipment of the village to copy
records. Such fees exclude the costs of any search for and review of the
record, and shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction and certification,
unless otherwise provided by state statute. The charge for copying shall be ten
cents ($0.10) per page for photocopies, five cents ($0.05) per page for
computer printouts, and two dollars fifty cents ($2.50) per audiotape, CD, or
DVD. No fees shall be charged for the first fifty (50) pages of black and
white, letter or legal sized copies requested by a requester. If the village
provides copies in color or in a size other than letter or legal, it shall
charge the actual cost for reproducing the records. In calculating the actual
cost for reproducing records or for the use of the equipment of the village to
reproduce the records, the village shall not include the costs of any search
for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated with
reproducing the records. The cost for certifying a record shall be one dollar
($1.00).
   B.   Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
where the village determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because furnishing information can be considered as primarily
benefiting the general public. Waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate
information regarding the health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the
general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or commercial
benefit. For purposes of this subsection, "commercial benefit" shall not apply
to requests made by news media when the principal purpose of the request is to
access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and welfare or
the legal rights of the general public. In setting the amount of the waiver or
reduction, the village may take into consideration the amount of materials
requested and the cost of copying them. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-8: TIME LIMIT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REQUEST:
   A.   Compliance With Request (Noncommercial Purpose): The village shall
either comply with or deny a request for public records within five (5)
business days after its receipt. If the village fails to respond to a request
within the requisite periods in this section but thereafter provides the
requester with copies of the requested public records, it may not impose a fee
for such copies. If the village fails to respond to a request received, it may
not treat the request as unduly burdensome under section
1-10-10 of this chapter. Denials shall be in writing and in accordance with
section
1-10-12 of this chapter.
   B.   Compliance With Request (Commercial Purpose): The village shall respond
to a request for records to be used for a commercial purpose within twenty one
(21) working days after receipt. The response shall:
      1.   Provide to the requester an estimate of the time required by the
village to provide the records requested and an estimate of the fees to be
charged, which the village may require the person to pay in full before copying
the requested documents,
      2.   Deny the request pursuant to one or more of the exemptions set out
in this chapter,
      3.   Notify the requester that the request is unduly burdensome and
extend an opportunity to the requester to attempt to reduce the request to
manageable proportions, or
      4.   Provide the records requested.
Unless the records are exempt from disclosure (see section
1-10-19 of this chapter), the village shall comply with a request within a
reasonable period considering the size and complexity of the request, and
giving priority to records requested for noncommercial purposes. No person
shall knowingly obtain a public record for a commercial purpose without
disclosing that it is for a commercial purpose, if requested to do so by the
village. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-9: EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT (NONCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE); NOTICE:
   A.   The time limit prescribed in subsection
1-10-8A of this chapter may be extended in each case for not more than five (5)
additional business days from the original due date for any of the following
reasons:
      1.   The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other
locations other than the office having charge of the requested records.
      2.   The request requires the collection of a substantial number of
specified records.
      3.   The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an
extensive search for the records responsive to it.
      4.   The requested records have not been located in the course of routine
search and additional efforts are being made to locate them.
      5.   The requested records require examination and evaluation by
personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they
are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Illinois freedom of
information act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions.
      6.   The request for records cannot be complied with by the village
within the time limits prescribed by the foregoing subsection without unduly
burdening or interfering with the operations of the village.
      7.   There is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all
practicable speed, with another public body or among two (2) or more components
of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the
subject matter of the request.
   B.   The person making a request and the village may agree in writing to
extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties. If
the requester and the village agree to extend the period for compliance, a
failure by the village to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be
treated as a denial of the request for the records.
   C.   When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the FOIA
officer shall notify the person making the request, by letter, within the five
(5) business days after receipt of the request, of the reasons for the delay
and the date by which the records will be made available or denial will be
forthcoming. In no instance may the delay in processing last longer than five
(5) business days. A failure to render a decision within the time permitted for
extension shall be considered a denial of the request.
   D.   If the village fails to respond to a request within the time permitted
for extension but thereafter provides the requester with copies of the
requested public records, the village may not impose a fee for those copies. If
the village requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond to the
request, it may not treat the request as unduly burdensome under section
1-10-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-10: UNDULY BURDENSOME REQUESTS:
   A.   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the village, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on the
village strongly outweighs the public interest in the information. Before
invoking this exemption, the village shall extend to the person making the
request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to
manageable proportions. If the village responds to a categorical request by
stating that compliance would unduly burden its operation and the conditions
described above are met, it shall do so in writing signed by the FOIA officer
specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to
which compliance will so burden the operation of the village. Such a response
shall be treated as a denial of the request for information.
   B.   Repeated requests for the same public records by the same person shall
be deemed unduly burdensome. Repeated requests from the same person for the
same records that are unchanged or identical to records previously provided or
properly denied under this chapter shall be deemed unduly burdensome. (Ord. 10-
01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-11: CERTAIN INFORMATION EXEMPT FROM INSPECTION AND COPYING:
Information exempted by sections 7 and 7.5 of the freedom of information act
shall be exempt from inspection and copying (see section
1-10-19 of this chapter). If a record contains both exempt and nonexempt
information, the village may elect to redact the information that is exempt and
make the remainder of the record available for inspection and copying.
Moreover, information described in items (iii) through (vi) of subsection C of
the definition for "public record" may be withheld if it is determined that
disclosure would: a) interfere with pending or actually and reasonably
contemplated law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement
agency; b) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement or
correctional personnel or any other person; or c) compromise the security of
any correctional facility. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-12: NOTICE OF DENIAL OF REQUEST; REQUEST FOR REVIEW:
   A.   The FOIA officer, when denying a request for public record, shall
notify the requester, by letter, of the decision to deny the information, the
reason for the denial, including a detailed factual basis for the application
of any exemption claimed, and the names and titles or positions of each person
responsible for the denial.
   B.   Each notice of denial by the FOIA officer shall inform the person of
the right to review by the public access counselor and provide the address and
phone number for the public access counselor.
   C.   Each notice of denial shall also inform such person of his or her right
to judicial review in accordance with section 11 of the freedom of information
act.
   D.   When a request is denied on the grounds that the records are exempt
under the provisions of this chapter, the notice of denial shall specify the
exemption claimed to authorize the denial and briefly explain how the exemption
applies to the specified records withheld.
   E.   Copies of all notices of denials shall be retained by the village in a
single central office file that is open to the public and indexed according to
the type of exemption asserted and, to the extent feasible, according to the
types of records requested.
   F.   Any person making a request for public records shall be deemed to have
exhausted his or her administrative remedies with respect to that request if
the village fails to act within the time periods provided in sections
1-10-8 and
1-10-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)
1-10-13: PUBLIC ACCESS COUNSELOR; OPINIONS:
   A.   A person whose request to inspect or copy a public record is denied by
the village may file a request for review with the public access counselor
established in the office of the attorney general not later than sixty (60)
days after the date of the final denial. The request for review must be in
writing, signed by the requester, and include: 1) a copy of the request for
access to records and 2) any responses from the public body.
   B.   If the village receives a request for records, and asserts that the
records are exempt under general exemptions (1)(C) or (1)(F) (see section
1-10-19 of this chapter), it shall, within the time periods provided for
responding to a request, provide written notice to the requester and the public
access counselor of its intent to deny the request in whole or in part. The
notice shall include:
      1.   A copy of the request for access to records;
      2.   The proposed response from the public body; and
      3.   A detailed summary of the public body's basis for asserting the
exemption.
   C.   In accordance with FOIA, upon receipt of a notice of intent to deny
from the village, the public access counselor determines whether further
inquiry is warranted. Within five (5) working days after receipt of the notice
of intent to deny, the public access counselor notifies the village and the
requester whether further inquiry is warranted. If the public access counselor
determines that further inquiry is warranted, the procedures set out in this
section regarding the review of denials, including the production of documents,
shall also be applicable to the inquiry and resolution of a notice of intent to
deny from the village. Times for response or compliance by the village under
sections
1-10-8 and
1-10-9 of this chapter shall be tolled until the public access counselor
concludes his or her inquiry.
   D.   In accordance with FOIA, upon receipt of a request for review, the
public access counselor determines whether further action is warranted. If the
public access counselor determines that the alleged violation is unfounded, he
or she so advises the requester and the village and no further action shall be
undertaken. In all other cases, the public access counselor forwards a copy of
the request for review to the village within seven (7) working days after
receipt and specifies the records or other documents that the village shall
furnish to facilitate the review. Within seven (7) working days after receipt
of the request for review, the FOIA officer shall provide copies of records
requested and shall otherwise fully cooperate with the public access counselor.
If the FOIA officer fails to furnish specified records pursuant to this
section, or if otherwise necessary, the attorney general may issue a subpoena
to any person or public body having knowledge of or records pertaining to a
request for review of a denial of access to records under the freedom of
information act. By statute, to the extent that records or documents produced
by the village contain information that is claimed to be exempt from disclosure
under section
1-10-19 of this chapter, the public access counselor does not further disclose
that information.
   E.   In accordance with FOIA, within seven (7) working days after it
receives a copy of a request for review and request for production of records
from the public access counselor, the FOIA officer may, but is not required to,
answer the allegations of the request for review. The answer may take the form
of a letter, brief, or memorandum. The public access counselor forwards a copy
of the answer to the person submitting the request for review, with any alleged
confidential information to which the request pertains redacted from the copy.
The requester may, but is not required to, respond in writing to the answer
within seven (7) working days and shall provide a copy of the response to the
village. In addition to the request for review, and the answer and the response
thereto, if any, a requester or the village may furnish affidavits or records
concerning any matter germane to the review.
   F.   In accordance with FOIA, unless the public access counselor extends the
time by no more than twenty one (21) business days by sending written notice to
the requester and the village that includes a statement of the reasons for the
extension in the notice, or decides to address the matter without the issuance
of a binding opinion, the attorney general examines the issues and the records,
makes findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issues to the requester and
the village an opinion in response to the request for review within sixty (60)
days after its receipt. The opinion is binding upon both the requester and the
village, subject to administrative review under section 11.5 of the freedom of
information act 1 .
Upon receipt of a binding opinion concluding that a violation of FOIA has
occurred, the FOIA officer shall either take necessary action immediately to
comply with the directive of the opinion or shall initiate administrative
review under section 11.5 of FOIA. If the opinion concludes that no violation
of FOIA has occurred, the requester may initiate administrative review under
section 11.5 of FOIA. If the village discloses records in accordance with an
opinion of the attorney general, it is immune from all liabilities by reason
thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under FOIA.
   G.   In accordance with FOIA, the attorney general may also issue advisory
opinions to the village regarding compliance with FOIA. A review may be
initiated upon receipt of a written request from the village mayor or the
village attorney, which shall contain sufficient accurate facts from which a
determination can be made. The public access counselor may request additional
information from the village in order to assist in the review. If the village
relies in good faith on an advisory opinion of the attorney general in
responding to a request, it is not liable for penalties under FOIA, so long as
the facts upon which the opinion is based have been fully and fairly disclosed
to the public access counselor. (Ord. 10-01, 1-25-2010)

1-10-19: APPENDIX A; EXEMPT MATERIALS PER THE FOIA:
Section 7 Of FOIA:
General Exemptions
   1.   The following shall be exempt from inspection and copying:
      A.   Information specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or
state law or rules and regulations implementing federal or state law.
      B.   Private information, unless disclosure is required by another
provision of this act, a state or federal law or a court order.
      C.   Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure
of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of
the information. "Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" means the
disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a
reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any
legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of
information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials
shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.
      D.   Records in the possession of the village created in the course of
administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional
agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure
would:
         (i)   Interfere with pending or actually and reasonably contemplated
law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement or correctional
agency that is the recipient of the request;
         (ii)   Interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings
conducted by the village that is the recipient of the request;
         (iii)   Create a substantial likelihood that a person will be deprived
of a fair trial or an impartial hearing;
         (iv)   Unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source,
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons
who file complaints with or provide information to administrative,
investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies; except that the identities
of witnesses to traffic accidents, traffic accident reports, and rescue reports
shall be provided by agencies of local government, except when disclosure would
interfere with an active criminal investigation conducted by the agency that is
the recipient of the request;
         (v)   Disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other
than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of
correctional agencies related to detection, observation or investigation of
incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable
harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;
         (vi)   Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement
personnel or any other person; or
         (vii)   Obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation by the agency that
is the recipient of the request.
      E.   Records that relate to or affect the security of correctional
institutions and detention facilities.
      F.   Preliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other
records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated,
except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be
exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the village mayor.
      G.   Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from
a person or business where the trade secrets or commercial or financial
information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged
or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or
financial information would cause competitive harm to the person or business,
and only insofar as the claim directly applies to the records requested.
         (i)   All trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained by the village, including a public pension fund, from a private equity
fund or a privately held company within the investment portfolio of a private
equity fund as a result of either investing or evaluating a potential
investment of public funds in a private equity fund. The exemption contained in
this item does not apply to the aggregate financial performance information of
a private equity fund, nor to the identity of the fund's managers or general
partners. The exemption contained in this item does not apply to the identity
of a privately held company within the investment portfolio of a private equity
fund, unless the disclosure of the identity of a privately held company may
cause competitive harm.
Nothing contained in this paragraph (G) shall be construed to prevent a person
or business from consenting to disclosure.
      H.   Proposals and bids for any contract, grant, or agreement, including
information which if it were disclosed would frustrate procurement or give an

1-11-6: Program Management And Accountability
1-11-7: Other Legal Requirements
1-11-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this identity theft prevention program (program) is to protect
customers of the village's utility services from identity theft. The program is
intended to establish reasonable policies and procedures to facilitate the
detection, prevention and mitigation of identity theft in connection with the
opening of new covered accounts and activity on existing covered accounts.
(Ord. 08-18, 10-13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)
1-11-2: SCOPE:
This program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying
information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the
village (electric, natural gas, water and wastewater) by any and all personnel
of the village, including management personnel. This program does not replace
or repeal any previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all
of the activities that are the subject of this program, but rather it is
intended to supplement any such existing policies and programs. (Ord. 08-18,
10-13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)
1-11-3: DEFINITIONS:
When used in this chapter, the following terms have the meanings set forth
opposite their name, unless the context clearly requires that the term be given
a different meaning:
COVERED ACCOUNT: An account that the village offers or maintains, primarily for
personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit
multiple payments or transactions (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(i)). A utility account is
a "covered account". The term "covered account" also includes other accounts
offered or maintained by the village for which there is a reasonably
foreseeable risk to customers or the utility from identity theft (16 CFR 681.2
(b)(3)(ii)).
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, social security number, date of birth, official state or
government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number.
Additional examples of "identifying information" are set forth in 16 CFR
section 603.2(a).
IDENTITY THEFT: A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority (16 CFR sections 681.2(b)(8)
and 603.2(a)).
RED FLAG: A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the possible
existence of identity theft.
Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the FTC's identity theft rules (16 CFR part 681) or the fair
credit reporting act of 1970 (15 USC section 1681 et seq.), as amended by the
fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 into law on December 4, 2003
(public law 108-159). (Ord. 08-18, 10-13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)
1-11-4: ADMINISTRATION:
The initial adoption and approval of the identity theft prevention program
shall be by ordinance of the village board. Thereafter, changes to the program
of a day to day operational character and decisions relating to the
interpretation and implementation of the program may be made by the mayor
(program administrator). Major changes or shifts of policy positions under the
program shall only be made by the village board.
Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the program will
be the responsibility of the program administrator. The program administrator
may, but shall not be required to, appoint a committee to administer the
program. The program administrator shall be the head of any such committee. The
program administrator will report at least annually to the village board
regarding compliance with this program.
Issues to be addressed in the annual identity theft prevention report include:
   A.   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk
of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts and
activity with respect to existing covered accounts.
   B.   Service provider arrangements.
   C.   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's
response.
   D.   Recommendations for material changes to the program, if needed for
improvement. (Ord. 08-18, 10-13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)
1-11-5: IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION ELEMENTS:
   A.   Identification Of Relevant Red Flags: The village has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the FTC's
identity theft rules and has reviewed the village's past history with instances
of identity theft, if any. The village hereby determines that the following are
the relevant red flags for purposes of this program given the relative size of
the village and the limited nature and scope of the services that the village
provides to its citizens:
      1.   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers.
         a.   A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report
or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
         b.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in
response to a request for a consumer report.
         c.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in section 681.1(b) of the FTC's identity theft rules.
         d.   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
            (1)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            (2)   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
            (3)   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            (4)   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      2.   The presentation of suspicious documents.
         a.   Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered
or forged.
         b.   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
         c.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
         d.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the village, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
         e.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
      3.   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
         a.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the village. For example:
            (1)   The address does not match any address in the consumer report
or CRA ID check response; or
            (2)   The social security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is
listed on the social security administration's death master file.
         b.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
         c.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third party sources used
by the village. For example:
            (1)   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
            (2)   The phone number on an application is the same as the number
provided on a fraudulent application.
         d.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third party
sources used by the village. For example:
            (1)   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
            (2)   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         e.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
         f.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
         g.   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
         h.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the village.
         i.   If the village uses challenge questions, the person opening the
covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
      4.   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
         a.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the village receives a request for the addition of authorized users on
the account.
         b.   A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer fails to make
the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
         c.   A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
         d.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
         e.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although usage of utility products or services continues in connection with the
customer's covered account.
         f.   The village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
         g.   The village is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products
or services in connection with a customer's covered account.
      5.   Notice of possible identity theft.
         a.   The village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
   B.   Detection Of Red Flags: The employees of the village who interact
directly with customers on a day to day basis shall have the initial
responsibility for monitoring the information and documentation provided by the
customer and any third party service provider in connection with the opening of
new accounts and the modification of or access to existing accounts and the
detection of any red flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that
all employees who might be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of
a new account or with modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are
properly trained such that they have a working familiarity with the relevant
red flags identified in this program so as to be able to recognize any red
flags that might surface in connection with the transaction. An employee who is
not sufficiently trained to recognize the red flags identified in this program
shall not open a new account for any customer, modify any existing account or
otherwise provide any customer with access to information in an existing
account without the direct supervision and specific approval of a management
employee. Management employees shall be properly trained such that they can
recognize the relevant red flags identified in this program and exercise sound
judgment in connection with the response to any unresolved red flags that may
present themselves in connection with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or accessing of an existing account. Management employees shall be
responsible for making the final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy
setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may apply for
service, the information and documentation to be provided by the prospective
customer in connection with an application for a new utility service account,
the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer with the
application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in which the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third party
service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally consistent
with the spirit of the customer identification program rules (31 CFR 103.121)
implementing section 326(a) of the USA PATRIOT act but need not be as detailed.
The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy
setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
   C.   Response To Detected Red Flags: If the responsible employees of the
village as set forth in the previous subsection are unable, after making a good
faith effort, to form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a
customer attempting to open a new account or modify or otherwise access an
existing account based on the information and documentation provided by the
customer and any third party service provider, the village shall not open the
new account or modify or otherwise provide access to the existing account as
the case may be. Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or
the modification or access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by
employees of the village and shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy
setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an unresolved red flag
situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating factors that may
heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that
results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a notice that a
customer has provided account information to a fraudulent individual or
website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity theft when a red
flag is detected include:
      1.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
      2.   Contacting the customer.
      3.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices
that permit access to a covered account.
      4.   Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
      5.   Not opening a new covered account.
      6.   Closing an existing covered account.
      7.   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a
covered account to a debt collector.
      8.   Notifying law enforcement.
      9.   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances. (Ord. 08-18, 10-13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)
1-11-6: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY:
   A.   Initial Risk Assessment; Covered Accounts: Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the FTC's identity theft rules. Therefore,
the village determines that with respect to its residential utility accounts it
offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The village also performed an initial
risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or maintains any other
accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or the
utility from identity theft. In making this determination the village
considered: 1) the methods it uses to open its accounts, 2) the methods it uses
to access its accounts, and 3) its previous experience with identity theft, and
it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such other covered
accounts.
   B.   Program Updates; Risk Assessment: The program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
program update include:
      1.   An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
      2.   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures.
      3.   Changes in methods of identity theft.
      4.   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
      5.   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   C.   Training And Oversight: All staff and third party service providers
performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to
be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. (Ord. 08-18, 10-
13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)
1-11-7: OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS:
Awareness of the following related legal requirements should be maintained:
   A.   31 USC 5318(g) - reporting of suspicious activities.
   B.   15 USC 1681c-1(h) - identity theft prevention; fraud alerts and active
duty alerts - limitations on use of information for credit extensions.
   C.   15 USC 1681s-2 - responsibilities of furnishers of information to
consumer reporting agencies.
   D.   15 USC 1681m - requirements on use of consumer reports. (Ord. 08-18,
10-13-2008, eff. 11-1-2008)

the Village; however, when the Department of CMS publishes changes in its
limits, the Village's limits shall be deemed to be changed in like amount.
   B.   Airfare: Since official business of the Village does not normally

business directly from an employee's or officer's residence, no reimbursement
will be made if the distance is less than the mileage of a normal commute to

normal commute, reimbursement will be paid based on the differential of the
commute less the mileage of a normal commute to the workplace.

hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) must be approved in an open meeting by a
majority roll-call vote of the Village Board.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY 1
SECTION:
1-14-1: Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-14-2: Definition Of Sexual Harassment
1-14-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-14-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-14-5: Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-14-6: Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
 
Notes
     This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights
  Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act
1 100-0554.
     The provisions of this policy will apply only insofar as they do not
  conflict with any state or federal law.
1-14-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of Village of Pawnee to prohibit harassment of any
person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 18-14, 11-26-2018)
1-14-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
      1.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      2.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls,” “smacking”
or “kissing” noises.
         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/Electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
   B.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.” (Ord. 18-14, 11-26-2018)
1-14-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   B.   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality.
      The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment
must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no
witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible
officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
      3.   Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must also be filed within three hundred (300) days.
   C.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   D.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 18-
14, 11-26-2018)
1-14-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   B.   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may
not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge - either due within three hundred days (300) days of the
alleged retaliation. (Ord. 18-14, 11-26-2018)
1-14-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to five thousands dollars ($5,000) per offense, applicable
discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and
penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law.
Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
State or Federal agency. (Ord. 18-14, 11-26-2018)
1-14-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
   A.   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   B.   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging
a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousands dollars ($5,000) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 18-14, 11-26-2018)

nontaxable as a sale for resale.
   B.   If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the Village

electricity, and shall furnish such additional information as the Village
President may reasonably require.

discontinued making resales.

and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this Chapter
directly to the Village Clerk pursuant to subsection
2-1-6B of this Chapter on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or
consumes, and shall collect the tax pursuant to Section

   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of one
percent (1%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act
or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer,
upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that
event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or
authorized by this Section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due
and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of one
percent (1%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state or multi-municipal
taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this

another State or municipality in this State on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the

by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this State and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected

owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the
manner provided by the Department.

collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 21-16, 7-12-2021)

rules and regulations created by the Department to implement the Act. (Ord. 21-
16, 7-12-2021)
2-6-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 21-16, 7-12-
2021)
2-6-6: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this
chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 21-

frame otherwise indicated.

percent (9.0%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365)
days and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 01-01,
1-22-2001)
2-7-11: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure

administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 01-01, 1-22-2001)

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the

filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 01-01, 1-22-2001)
2-7-14: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 01-01, 1-22-2001)

The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a

shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord. 01-

The streets and public areas within the village should be readily accessible

which they were intended. Such activity can constitute a public health and
safety hazard which adversely impacts neighborhoods and commercial areas.
Camping on private property without the consent of the owner, without proper
sanitary facilities and measures and for other than a minimal duration
adversely affects private property rights as well as public health, safety, and
welfare of the village.
The purpose of this chapter is to maintain streets, parks and other public and
private areas within the village in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition
and to adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the
community, while recognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping
and camp facilities associated with special events can be beneficial to the
cultural and educational climate in the village. (Ord. 14-16, 9-8-2014)

3-5-5: SPECIAL EVENTS:
The village board may, in its discretion, issue a permit to establish, maintain
and operate campsites on public or private property in connection with a
special event. A special event includes, but is not limited to, programs
operated by the village departments, youth, school, church and club events,

established by the village board shall be paid in advance of the camping event
by the applicant, to reimburse the village for any extraordinary costs

service pipe or transmit gas supplied by the natural gas system of the Village
into two (2) distinct premises from one meter. Apartment buildings having
separate dwelling units may be serviced from a single meter. Duplex dwellings

bill may be rendered based, at the option of the village, on either the nearest
previous three (3) months' average use, when meter was in good order, or based
on the same month of the preceding year. Whenever the village shall have reason
to believe that the meter is not registering correctly, then an average bill,
as stated above, may be rendered and the meter removed for testing. If such
average bill should prove to be incorrectly estimated, either by actual testing
or by actual gas consumption after being replaced by a corrected meter, then
such bill shall be compared to the same. (Ord. 75-14, 6-9-1975)

and there were no delinquent charges or violations of the provisions of this
chapter, there shall be no charge for the renewal of the gas service.
   D.   Customer Use Of Stopcock Or Service Connection: No customer shall be
permitted to use the stopcock or the service connection for shutting off gas

deposits with the Village the estimated cost of making the extension. Such
deposit shall be interest free. In the event that the amount deposited is
greater or less than the actual cost of the extension, such excess or
deficiency shall be corrected prior to giving service. Extensions shall also

whatsoever rendered during working hours. (Ord. 75-14, 6-9-75)
6-2-14: LIABILITY OF VILLAGE:
   A.   The Village shall have the right to shut off the supply of gas whenever
it is necessary to make repairs, improvements, enforce rules or for any
operating reason. In all cases, where possible, a reasonable notice of the
circumstances will be given to the customers, but in an emergency the gas may
be shut off without notice. Such necessary repairs or work will be made by the
Village as rapidly as may be practical. The Village shall not be held
responsible or liable because of any shut off or discontinuance of service for
any direct or resultant damages to any person.
   B.   In the event of such discontinuance of gas service, the Village will
make every attempt to safeguard the customer and service shall not be renewed
until the Village authorities have purged the lines and put into service all
automatic controls and pilots. The cost of purging of lines, relighting pilots
and checking automatic controls will be borne by the Village and the customer
will not be liable for any portion thereof. Where the nature of the customer's
operations are such that an interruption of service might create a hazard or
large economic loss, such customer shall provide facilities for standby service
if desired.
   C.   Whenever mains, pipes, service connections or other facilities of the
gas system are taken up, shut off or interfered with by reasons of any Village
street improvement, the Village will endeavor to maintain service so far as is
reasonably possible, but will not be directly or indirectly liable for any
interruption, poor pressure or damage of any kind either to the customers
adjacent or to other customers affected thereby. Direct damage to property due
to such operations shall be either repaired or replaced by the Village without
cost to the customer.
   D.   The Village expressly stipulates, with all customers and other persons
who may be affected by the discontinuance of service, that it will neither
insure nor be responsible or liable in any manner for any loss or damages,
direct or indirect, by any reason of any fire or any other cause, and all gas
service furnished shall also be conditional upon acts of God, inevitable
accidents, fire, strikes, riots or any other causes. (Ord. 75-14, 6-9-75)

days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this Chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with Section 6-6-21 of this Chapter. If
the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right of way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord. 98-

this Chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
Chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this Chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and

least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Street Department Superintendent, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Street
Department Superintendent may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each
phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for
phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,

within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:

hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this Section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this Section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 98-20, 11-9-

Chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   B.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions covered wire or other means.

Department Superintendent determines that such removal will be in the best
interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the
Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it,
by giving notice of abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be
deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the
facility by another utility or person. (Ord. 98-20, 11-9-1998)
6-6-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the utility
shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain in a timely
manner and to the satisfaction of the Village. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the Street Department Superintendent. Such
cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right of way to a
condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the
commencement of the project. (Ord. 98-20, 11-9-1998)

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Street Department Superintendent or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the Village police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the Village a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty eight
(48) hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. 98-20, 11-9-1998)

shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this
Chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Street Department
Superintendent may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship

   D.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely, in the
opinion of the Superintendent of the Sewer Department that such wastes can harm
either the sewers, sewage treatment process or equipment, have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public
property or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability of these wastes, the Superintendent of the Sewer Department will
give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of
the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage
treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant

      12.   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
   E.   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged
to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in subsection D of this Section and/or which are in
violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in chapter 1, EPA Rules
and regulations, subchapter D, Water Programs Part 128 - Pretreatment
Standards, Federal Register Volume 38, No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973, and
any amendments thereto, and which, in the judgment of the Superintendent of the

processes, equipment or receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent of the Sewer
Department may:
      1.   Reject the wastes;
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

the Sewer Department and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances and laws.
   F.   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent of the Sewer Department, they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or
any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except, that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Superintendent of the Sewer Department and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   G.   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at his expense.
   H.   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the Superintendent of the Sewer Department, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent of the Sewer Department. The manhole shall be installed by
the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
   I.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this Chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the Village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type and frequency of
laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the
Village, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete
analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that
compliance with the Federal, State and local standards are being met. The owner
shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the Village
at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the Village. The owner shall
bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting required by the
Village. At such times as deemed necessary, the Village reserves the right to
take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   J.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this Chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but
not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24 hour
composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.)
   K.   No statement contained in this Section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with Section 7-5-2 of this Title by the industrial concern;
provided, such payments are in accordance with Federal and State guidelines for
user charge system and industrial cost recovery system. (Ord. 76-3, 5-10-76)

of any subsequent amendment hereto, may be continued in accordance with the
regulations which follow. (Ord. 93-11, 6-14-93)
9-4-3: EXEMPTED BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES:
   A.   A nonconforming building, structure or use lawfully established on the

hereof.
   B.   A nonconforming use shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to any
other position of the lot occupied by such use on the effective date hereof.
   C.   If a nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of six (6) months or
more and if the building or structure thereon are adaptable to a use permitted
in the district in which it is located, then a subsequent use of land must
conform to the regulations specified by this Title for the district in which it
is located.
   D.   Should a nonconforming use or structure or building, which is designed
or intended for a use which is not permitted in the district in which it is
located, deteriorate or be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or
act of God to the extent that the cost of the restoration to the condition in
which it was before the occurrence will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the cost
of the restoration of the entire building new, then it shall not be restored
unless said building or structure or use shall conform to all of the
regulations in the district in which it is located.
   E.   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use
when such nonconforming use is located in a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a

particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this Title.
   B.   Initiation: An application for a variance may be made by any person,
firm or corporation requesting or intending to request application for a
building permit or by a person who has been notified by the Zoning
Administrator that his property is not in compliance with this Title.
   C.   Processing:
      1.   An application for a variance shall be filed with the Village Clerk.
The Village Clerk shall forward such application to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for processing in accordance with the applicable statutes of the State 1 .
      2.   No variance shall be made by the Zoning Board of Appeals except
after a public hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals, of which there shall
be a notice of time and place of the hearing published at least once, not more
than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in one or
more newspapers with a general circulation within the Village, and a written
notice is served at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing on the owners of
the properties located adjacent to the location for which the variation is
requested.
   D.   Decisions: All decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals on variations
arrived at after the hearing shall require a concurring vote of four (4) of its
members, and such decisions shall be final, subject only to judicial review in
accordance with applicable statutes of the State.
   E.   Standards:
      1.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not vary the provisions of this
Title as authorized in this Section unless it shall have made findings based
upon the evidence presented to it that all of the following conditions apply:
         a.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;
         b.   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
         c.   That the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      2.   The Zoning Board of Appeals, in making the foregoing determination,
may take into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable
to the applicant, have been established by the evidence:
         a.   That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of regulation were to be carried out;
         b.   That the conditions upon which the petition for variance is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
         c.   That the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property;
         e.   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
         f.   That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      3.   The Zoning Board of Appeals may require such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in this Section to reduce or minimize the
injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and
to implement the general purpose and intent of this Title.
   F.   Authorized Variances: Variation from the regulations of this Title may
be decided by the Zoning Board of Appeals only in accordance with the standards
set forth in this Section, and only in the following instances and no others:
      1.   To permit a yard less than the yard required by the applicable
regulations;
      2.   To permit the use of a lot not of record on September 8, 1975, for a
use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient area of the lot,
but in no event shall the area of the lot be less than ninety percent (90%) of
the required lot area;
      3.   To permit parking lots to be illuminated between the hours of nine
thirty o'clock (9:30) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M.;
      4.   To permit the same off-street parking spaces to qualify as required
spaces for two (2) or more uses; provided, that the maximum uses of such
facility by each use does not take place during the same hours on the same days
of the week;
      5.   To increase by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the uses
served; and
      6.   To allow any permitted nonresidential use in a residence district to
exceed the floor area ratio imposed by the applicable regulations.
      7.   To allow a variance on the permissible scope of home occupations (as
defined in Section 9-1-4 of this Title) as follows:
a. To allow an exterior sign of reasonable dimensions; provided, however, that
this shall not be construed to allow an illuminated sign;
         b.   To allow reasonable exterior display and exterior storage of
materials and equipment used in home occupations;
         c.   To allow reasonable on-street parking in connection with home
occupations; provided, however, that:
         d.   Where variances are allowed under subsection F7a, F7b and F7c of
this Section, the Zoning Board of Appeals may restrict the hours of operation
of the home occupation or any exterior sign, display or storage or on-street
parking; the Zoning Board of Appeals may condition any such variance upon
observance by the occupant of such restrictions, and upon notice and hearing,
the Zoning Board of Appeals may revoke such variance for breach of such
restrictions.
      8.   To allow variances from requirements for swimming pools, fences and
satellite dishes. (Ord. 93-11, 6-14-1993)
      9.   No variance shall be allowed which would permit a fence, swimming
pool, satellite dish, porch or other permanent or semi- permanent structure
within an easement owned by the Village or otherwise dedicated to public use,
without the consent of the Village Board. In the event the Zoning Board of
Appeals receives an application for such a variance, it shall consider the
application as in the case of any variance request. It may deny the request, in
which case no further action by the Village Board is required. But if the
Zoning Board of Appeals grants the variance, such a grant of variance shall be
conditional upon approval by the Village Board. The Village shall approve such
a variance only by motion made, seconded and duly recorded in the minutes. Any
variance which would allow encroachment upon an easement owned by the Village
or by a public utility shall be subject to the condition that should the
Village or public utility order the removal of the encroaching structure, the
structure shall be removed by the property owner. The variance shall be subject
to the further condition that should the property owner fail to remove the
encroaching structure within the time ordered by the Village Board or public
utility, or in the event of an emergency, or in the event the property owner is
not available, the Village or the public utility may remove the encroaching
structure, and the property owner shall not be entitled to any compensation
whatever for damages caused thereby. (Ord. 96-15, 8-12-1996)
   G.   Duration Of Variance:
      1.   A variance shall be extinguished if construction of the variance is
not completed within six (6) months of the date the variance is granted, unless
additional time is allowed at the time the variance is granted.
      2.   A variance is extinguished if its use lapses for a period of six (6)
months.
      3.   A variance allowing a shed or other obstruction in an easement,
right of way, required yard or swale shall be extinguished upon thirty (30)
days notice to the property owner, if the Village Board determines that the
obstruction is a hindrance to the operation, maintenance or repair of drainage,
utilities or other uses of the easement, right of way, required yard or swale.
The property owner recognizes that in the event of an emergency, any shed or
other obstruction may be moved by the Village of utility company in order to
effectuate needed repairs, and the property owner is solely responsible for any
damages to the personal property located in the easement.

9-7-8: CONDITIONAL PERMITTED USES:
   A.   Purpose: The development and execution of the zoning title is based
upon the division of the village into districts within any one of which the use
of land and buildings and the bulk and location of the buildings or structures,
as related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however,
that there are conditional permitted uses which, because of their unique
character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or
districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon
neighboring lands and upon public need for the particular use of the particular
location. Such conditional permitted uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities or
uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
   B.   Authority:
      1.   Conditional permitted uses shall be authorized or denied by the
village board in accordance with the regulations and condition set forth in
this title for conditional permitted uses.
      2.   No application for a conditional permitted use shall be acted upon
by the village board until after:
         a.   A written report is prepared and forwarded to the village board
by the plan commission in a manner prescribed herein for amendments to this
title; and
         b.   A public hearing has been held by the plan commission after due
notice by publication as provided by the applicable statutes of the state for
amendments, and the findings and recommendations of the plan commission have
been reported to the village board.
   C.   Initiation: An application for a conditional permitted use may be made
by any person, firm or corporation or by an office, department, board, bureau
or commission requesting or intending to request a zoning certificate.
   D.   Processing: An application for a conditional permitted use, in such
form and accompanied by such information as shall be established from time to
time by the plan commission, shall be filed with the village clerk and
thereafter processed in the manner prescribed heretofore for applications for
amendments.
   E.   Decisions:
      1.   The village board, upon report of the plan commission and without
further hearing, may authorize or deny an application for a special use in
accordance with the statutes of the state applicable to amendments, or may
refer it back to the plan commission for further consideration.
      2.   No conditional permitted use shall be authorized by the village
board unless the conditional permitted use:
         a.   Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location;
         b.   Is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated that the
public health, safety and welfare will be protected; and
         c.   Would not cause substantial injury to the value of other property
in the neighborhood in which it is located. (Ord. 93-11, 6-14-1993)
9-7-9: FEES FOR VARIANCES, APPEALS AND AMENDMENTS:
Any application for an amendment, conditional permitted use, variance or appeal
filed by or on behalf of the owner or owners of the property affected shall be
accompanied by an application fee of two hundred eighty dollars ($280.00), plus
the cost of publication of the notice in the Pawnee Post or other newspaper of
general circulation within the village.
Any applicant for a variance, amendment, conditional permitted use or appeal of
the provisions of this code must submit a drawing showing the provisions of any
request for a variance, and must locate the survey pins on the corners of the
subject property. If the pins can not be located, the applicant must obtain a
survey of the property to place the pins. Village employees will not locate
pins for purposes of meeting this requirement.
Any application for any action, filed by an officer, board or commission of the
village of Pawnee, Illinois, not on behalf of any specific private interest,
shall not be accompanied by any fee.
(Ord. 08-10, 6-23-2008; amd. Ord. 20-03, 3-30-2020)
9-7-10: VIOLATION, PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT:
Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, omits, neglects or refuses to
comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this
title shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense. Each day that a
violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. The zoning
administrator is hereby designated and authorized to enforce this title. (Ord.
93-11, 6-14-1993)
9-7-11: NUISANCES:
Every structure and lot which is in violation of this title is hereby declared
a nuisance. The village may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
equitable relief to restrain, enjoin or abate any such nuisance. (Ord. 93-11,

CHAPTER 2
LOCATION AND SKETCH MAPS
SECTION:
10-2-1: Purpose
10-2-2: Submission Requirements
10-2-3: Subdivision (Including Large Scale Plan) Site Suitability
10-2-4: Location And Sketch Maps Review Process
10-2-5: Validity Of Location And Sketch Maps Approval
10-2-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the location and sketch maps is to determine the suitability of
the site for subdividing and subsequent development. Suitability shall be
measured by the conformance with the Comprehensive Plan, effect on natural
resources and natural systems, ability to provide adequate essential services
to the site and conformance with the goals of this title set forth in section
10-1-3 of this title. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-1991)
10-2-2: SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
Information filed with the Plan Commission shall be of sufficient detail so
that the commission can determine whether and how essential services will be
provided and if the site is suitable.
   A.   Location Map: The location map shall consist of data added to an
existing base map of a suitable scale, covering an area of at least one mile
radius from the tract proposed for development. The location map shall show the
following information:
      1.   North point, scale and date.
      2.   Outline of the entire area owned or controlled by the subdivider
with approximate boundary dimensions and total acreage.
      3.   Existing streets and roads expected to serve the area to be
subdivided.
      4.   Existing utility lines expected to serve the area to be subdivided.
   B.   Sketch Map: The sketch map shall show the general layout and character
of the proposed development. The scale shall be no more than one hundred feet
to the inch (1" = 100'). Exact dimensions or engineering plans are not
required. The sketch map shall show the following information:
      1.   North point, scale and date.
      2.   Area to be subdivided with general dimensions.
      3.   Proposed street network and alignments with existing streets.
      4.   General lot layout.
      5.   Potential open space, public parks, existing waterways, drainage or
retention areas, etc.
      6.   Outstanding or unusual natural features and vegetation.
   C.   Additional Information: In addition to the information required below,
any other information necessary for the Plan Commission to determine site
suitability or adequacy of mitigating factors as outlined in section
10-2-3 of this chapter shall be submitted:
      1.   Title of the proposed subdivision.
      2.   Names, addresses and phone numbers of the owner, subdivider,
engineer and land surveyor. A contact person should be designated.
      3.   Proposed use and approximate number of housing units.
      4.   Existing and proposed zoning.
      5.   Method of sewage disposal.
      6.   Method of water supply.
      7.   Electric service provider.
      8.   Fire protection district.
      9.   School district. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-1991)
10-2-3: SUBDIVISION (INCLUDING LARGE SCALE PLAN) SITE SUITABILITY:
   A.   Definitions: As used in this section:
      LAND PROPOSED TO BE SUBDIVIDED: Includes land proposed to be developed
pursuant to a Large Scale Plan.
      SUBDIVISION AND SUBDIVIDE: Include not only the division of a tract into
lots, but also development of a single tract pursuant to a Large Scale Plan.
      SUITABLE FOR SUBDIVIDING: Includes suitability for development pursuant
to a Large Scale Plan.
   B.   Essential Utilities And Public Services: Land proposed to be
subdivided, shall have essential utilities and public services available within
a reasonable distance and time period. Land to which these essential utilities
and services will not be so provided shall be deemed unsuitable for
subdividing. Essential utilities and services and criteria for determining if
they can adequately be provided shall include the following:
      1.   Sewage Disposal:
         a.   Sanitary sewer service provided by the Village shall be the
preferred method of sewage disposal. If sanitary sewer service is currently
available to the land proposed to be subdivided, it shall be the sewage
disposal method used.
         b.   If sanitary sewer service is not currently available, the land
may be deemed suitable for subdividing if:
            (1)   Sanitary sewers shall be installed by the subdivider for
future service to each building site;
            (2)   On-site sewage disposal facilities can and will be provided;
and
            (3)   The subdivider pays the cost to the Village for extension of
Village sewer mains to the subdivision.
         c.   The Village may, but is not required to, share with the developer
the cost of extending sewer lines.
         d.   For industrial developments, the Large Scale Plan submission will
contain an assessment of probable effluent quantity and quality, and whether
pretreatment will be required.
      2.   Water Supply:
         a.   The Village water supply shall be the preferred public water
supply. For developments outside the Village corporate limits and within the
Village's 1.5 mile planning jurisdiction, the Otter Lake Water Commission,
ADGPTV is the preferred public water supply. No subdivision will be approved
utilizing any public water supply other than the Village or the Otter Lake
Water Commission, ADGPTV, unless the developer can prove that the preferred
public water supply is unavailable or inadequate, or the Village by ordinance
or resolution waives this requirement due to: 1) the infeasibility of the
Village or Otter Lake Water Commission providing water to the development, or
2) an intergovernmental agreement between the Village and another public water
supply regarding supply of water to the development.
         b.   Private wells may be permitted for developments outside the
Village if the developer can demonstrate that it is not feasible to extend
water mains to the land proposed to be subdivided. As a minimum guideline, the
extension of one hundred twenty feet (120') of water main per lot of the
preliminary plan, or per acre of an industrial large scale development, shall
be deemed feasible. This distance shall be measured between the nearest
suitable public water main and the proposed development. Mains within the
development shall not count toward this extension footage.
      3.   Fire Protection: Land proposed to be subdivided shall meet the
following conditions in order to be deemed suitable for subdividing:
         a.   Land shall be within a fire protection district or a petition to
annex to a district shall have been filed;
         b.   There shall be a public road providing adequate access for
emergency vehicles to the site. Roadways shall have an all- weather driving
surface (minimum oil and chip) with twenty feet (20') of unobstructed width.
Where a bridge is required to be used as a part of the most direct fire truck
access route, it shall have a minimum vertical clearance of thirteen feet six
inches (13'6") and be constructed and maintained to carry the live loads
imposed by fire trucks;
         c.   There shall be a system of water mains or other source of water
adequate for firefighting purposes. Specific fire flows shall be determined by
the Pawnee Fire Protection District using a standard published by the Insurance
Service Office entitled Guide for Determination of Required Fire Flow; and
         d.   A full sprinkler system installed with adequate water available
as determined by the National Fire Protection Association Standards 13 or 13D
depending on the occupancy of the building shall also satisfy this requirement.
      4.   Streets: The suitability of existing streets for access to the
proposed subdivision and/or for incorporation into the proposed subdivision's
street system shall also be considered. For residential developments, a street
shall be considered suitable if:
         a.   The street is constructed of all-weather material (concrete,
asphalt, oil mat);
         b.   The paved area is at least twenty feet (20') wide with a road bed
twenty four feet (24') wide; and
         c.   The street has good drainage.
For commercial and industrial projects, the developer shall provide a
certificate from a registered professional engineer that streets providing
access to the development both during construction and afterward, and the
streets within the development, are suitable.
If only a portion of the criteria set forth in this subsection B4 is met, the
Village Engineer, a representative of the Pawnee Fire Protection District and a
representative of the Plan Commission shall make the recommendation as to
whether the street is suitable for the proposed development or what
improvements must be undertaken to make it suitable.
      5.   Police Protection: In determining the suitability of land for
subdivision purposes, the distance that police would have to travel to respond
to a call for service shall be considered.
   C.   Other Requirements: Land proposed to be subdivided shall meet the
following requirements:
      1.   Site must be in conformance with the Pawnee Comprehensive Plan, if
such a plan is adopted.
      2.   Development must not be located in a 100-year floodplain or flood
prone area, and shall comply in all respects with the Village floodplain
ordinance 1  or successor ordinance.
      3.   Development must not be located in an environmentally sensitive area
and its tributaries unless the subdivider can show that environmental concerns
can be mitigated.
      4.   Site must be of a shape, size and terrain so that usable lots and
streets in conformance with this title can and will be created.
      5.   Development must not have a major conflict with existing use of
adjacent property (wastewater treatment plants, power plants, major industrial
plants, landfills, certain agricultural uses, etc.) unless it is shown that
factors which cause the conflict can and will be mitigated.
      6.   Development must not cause major off-site impacts and problems
relating to, but not limited to, streets, drainage water system, parks. If it
is determined by the Plan Commission that major off-site impacts will result,
the subdivider must agree to mitigate the portion of the impact caused by the
subdivision.
      7.   When soils in the area to be developed have severe limitations for
building site development or sanitary facilities as determined by the USDA Soil
Conservation Service, the subdivider shall submit information indicating how
these limitations will be addressed.
      8.   For industrial projects, developer must submit a noise study and a
certification by a registered professional engineer with demonstrated
competence in acoustical engineering, that the project as designed will meet
all Illinois EPA noise regulations, including but not limited to the Sound
Emission Standards established in title 35, part 901 of the Illinois
Administrative Code. (Ord. 17-14, 8-14-2017)
 
Notes
1 1. See title 11, chapter 1 of this Code.

than one degree (1°), the following curves will be required in the street:
major and minor arterials and collector streets shall have a minimum center
line radius of three hundred feet (300') and a minimum length of curve of one
hundred feet (100'); arterials and collectors having a design speed and/or
expected posted speed greater than thirty (30) miles per hour shall be
consistent with the latest revision of the horizontal curvature requirements of
ASSHTO; a Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, for the
appropriate roadway classification; all other types of streets shall have a
minimum center line radius of one hundred feet (100'). The pavement in all
cases shall be wide enough to allow the movement of a WB-50 Design vehicle, as
described in the State of Illinois, "Department of Transportation Design
Manual".
      2.   Intersections: Intersections of major and minor arterials and
collectors with roadways of the same classes shall not be closer than one-
quarter (1/4) of a mile from any other such functionally classed roadways'
intersections. These intersections shall be located at the one-quarter (1/4)
mile grid points.
      3.   Street Offsets: Street center line offsets shall not be less than
one hundred twenty five feet (125'), unless otherwise warranted to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer.
      4.   Curb Corners: All curb corners shall have a minimum radius of twenty
five feet (25').
   C.   Pavement Construction: Except as may be approved by the Village Board
for a specific project, pavements shall be installed in accordance with the
following standards:
      All streets shall be constructed as follows:
      Aggregate Base course: 8" of CA-6 gradation per the Illinois Department
of Transportation’s Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
latest revision.
      Surface course: Class A-3 per the Illinois Department of Transportation’s
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, latest revision.
   D.   Pavement Width:
      1.   All streets shall be improved with pavements to an overall width in
accordance with the following general guidelines:
 
Type of Street   Pavement Width
                 (edge of pavement to edge of pavement)
Major arterial   40 feet minimum
Minor arterial   32 feet
Collector street 27 feet
Local street     27 feet
 
      2.   The minimum pavement width shall be twenty seven feet (27') from the
edge of pavement to edge of pavement, not including the curb and gutter.
Different widths may be used depending on the anticipated traffic volumes and
parking demand. These widths of pavement shall be determined by the Plan
Commission and the Village Engineer in consultation with the engineer for the
subdivider. If a pavement width narrower than the above stated minimum results
from this consultation, the subdivider shall install "No Parking" signs at his
expense.
   E.   Curb and Gutter: The standard curb and gutter required adjacent to
flexible pavement shall be a mountable type constructed of Portland cement
concrete with the following dimensions: twenty four inches (24") wide, eight
inches (8") thick on the front face (pavement side), ten inches (10") thick on
the back face, seven inches (7") thick at center line (flow line), and a ten
inches (10") radius in the flow line. The curb and gutter adjacent to concrete
pavement, if poured monolithically, may be limited to the thickness of the
pavement.
   F.   Pavement Crown: The minimum crown used on all pavements shall be one-
quarter inch (1/4") per foot measured from the edge of the pavement to the
center line of the street.
   G.   Cul-de-Sac Streets: Local streets that are also cul-de-sac streets
shall be no more than six hundred feet (600') long unless necessitated by
topography in which case they shall be no longer than one thousand feet
(1,000'), unless provision is made for an interim turnaround with a radius
sufficient to accommodate emergency vehicles and/or a median entrance (see
subsection I of this Section). A turnaround shall be provided at the closed end
having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty six feet (86') edge to
edge of pavement and a street right-of-way diameter of one hundred ten feet
(110'). No obstructions shall be permitted in the cul-de-sac turnaround.
   H.   Stub Streets: Access shall be provided to adjoining property not yet
subdivided. Proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of
such unsubdivided property. At the end of all temporary stub streets, a
barricade meeting the provisions of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices shall be installed by the subdivider. Stub streets in excess of
two hundred fifty feet (250') shall be provided with a temporary cul-de-sac
with an outside roadway diameter of at least ninety feet (90'). The type of
constructions shall be determined by the appropriate street authority in the
amount needed in excess of the normally required right of way for the temporary
turnaround. When the street is extended in the future, the extra turnaround
pavement shall be removed and curb and gutters and sidewalks constructed by the
subdivider who constructed the temporary pavement or by the subsequent lot
owner.
   I.   Multiple Access: Any area of development containing seventy (70) or
more single-family lots (or equivalent population) shall be served by two (2)
functioning points of access. Where higher densities of development are
proposed, a divided type entrance roadway may suffice with a median of adequate
width to ensure continued emergency access lanes on one side. Depending on
location and height of nearby poles or trees, the required median width shall
range between twelve feet (12') and thirty feet (30'). This type of roadway
construction is intended to accommodate higher density developments and not to
lengthen the overall length of a cul-de-sac.
   J.   Restriction of Access: When a subdivision or a portion of it adjoins a
major or minor arterial, no lot shall have direct access to the arterial. The
lot shall have adequate depth for screen planting on the portion of the lot
contiguous to the major or minor arterial.
   K.   Street Names and Street Signs:
      1.   A proposed street that is in alignment with and/or joins an existing
named street shall bear the name of the existing street. In no case shall the
proposed name of a street duplicate the name of an existing street within the
plat jurisdiction of this Title. The use of the suffix "street", "avenue",
"boulevard", "driveway", "place", "court" or similar description shall not be a
distinction sufficient to constitute compliance with this requirement.
      2.   Street name signs shall be erected at all intersections within the
Village jurisdiction at the expense of the subdivider and shall be subject to
the specifications of the "Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices".
   L.   Private Streets: There shall be no private streets platted in any
subdivision. Every subdivision lot shall be served from a publicly-dedicated
street.
   M.   Alleys: Alleys are not recommended in residential subdivisions unless
deemed necessary by the Plan Commission.
   N.   Ramps: Where sidewalks cross a barrier type curb and gutter as
described in subsection E2 hereof, ramps shall be constructed to accommodate
the handicapped. These ramps shall be constructed to the lines and grades shown
on the standard sidewalk ramp example. Inlets for storm drainage shall not be
located so that a pedestrian way will be interrupted by the inlet grates. Other
locations where these ramps are required shall be determined by the Village
Engineer.
   O.   Typical Street Section:

IMAGES/0-0-0-1267.gif]
   P.   Medians and Islands:
      1.   Where medians or islands are proposed, they shall be constructed
with barrier curbing. All medians and islands shall be the responsibility of
the subdivider and/or a subdivision association to maintain. No sign may be
installed in the median which blocks the sight distance at the intersection. If
such a sign is to be installed, detailed plans for the sign shall be submitted
with the construction plans for approval. In no case shall an island or median
contain any other sign or structure, except as may be placed for traffic
control under the direction of the Village Engineer.
      2.   The subdivider or subdivision association may landscape medians or
islands. Ground cover may not exceed a maximum height of twelve inches (12").
Any additional living plant material must be maintained to allow visibility
across, over or through medians and islands at a height of three to ten feet
(3' - 10') above the adjacent roadway pavements.
(Ord. 91-14, 9-23-91; amd. Ord. 20-11, 5-11-2020; Ord. 20-17, 8-10-2020)
10-7-4: LOT AND BLOCK DESIGN:
   A.   Size of Lots: Minimum lot sizes shall be the minimum for the applicable
zoning district of Pawnee, except when outside the corporate limits where a
private sewage disposal system is necessary. When a private sewage disposal
system will be used for greater than one year, lots shall be a minimum of
twenty thousand (20,000) square feet.
   B.   Lot Arrangement:
      1.   Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
substantially radial to curved street lines. However, for purposes of solar
orientation, side lot lines need not be at right angles to straight street
lines or radial to curved street lines; provided, that side lot lines run
within twenty degrees (20°) east or west from due north to due south. If side
lot lines are being varied for solar orientation, layout and building setbacks
shall also be oriented with their long axis running from east to west, with a
possible variation of twenty degrees (20°) to the southwest or twenty degrees
(20°) to the southeast.
      2.   Each lot shall front upon a public street.
      3.   Flag lots shall be permitted only if the Plan Commission determines
that no public health and safety problems or additional costs or difficulties
providing Municipal services will result.
      4.   Through lots shall be permitted only when access is prohibited to
one street as described in subsection
10-7-3J of this Chapter.
      5.   All lots must contain sufficient buildable area.
   C.   Sizes of Blocks: Blocks shall not be less than four hundred feet (400')
nor more than one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), in length measured along
the greatest dimension of the enclosed block area. In blocks over eight hundred
feet (800') in length, the Plan Commission may require one or more public
crosswalks with a right of way of not less than ten feet (10') in width to
extend entirely across the block at locations deemed necessary at intervals not
closer than four hundred feet (400').
   D.   Survey Monuments: All survey monuments shall be located and be made of
the appropriate material as required by State law 1 .
   E.   Lot Grading:
      1.   Trees that cannot be saved, stumps, boulders and similar items shall
be removed.
      2.   All grading in the subdivision shall be related to the topography of
the surrounding area. All street embankments shall be raised at least one and
one-half feet (11/2') above the high water elevation.
      3.   All building lots shall be graded or have natural slopes that will
properly allow surface drainage to flow away from the principal structures to
be located on the lot.
      4.   Grading in the subdivision shall provide alternate drainage ways for
the purpose of carrying water away from homes and preventing damage during
periods of heavy rainfall. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-91)
 
Notes
1 1. S.H.A. 765 ILCS 205/1.
10-7-5: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL:
   A.   During construction of public improvement, measures shall be taken to
control erosion and sedimentation to insure that sediment will not be
transported from the site by a storm event of 2-year frequency or less. The
erosion and sediment control plan shall include measures to stabilize and
protect disturbed areas, keep runoff velocities low, retain sediment on site
and protect disturbed areas from runoff. The location, type and configuration
of controls such as swales, berms, dams, sediment basins and release mechanisms
shall be included with the construction plans.
   B.   Temporary or permanent soil stabilization measures, whichever is
applicable, shall be applied within fifteen (15) days after final grading to
all areas where the soil has been disturbed or the vegetative cover removed.
Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seed bed preparation,
expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer application and
kind and quantity of mulch for temporary or permanent vegetative control
measures shall be included with the construction plans. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-1991)
10-7-6: UTILITY EASEMENTS; LOCATION OF UTILITIES:
   A.   Utility Easements:
      1.   Utility easements shall be provided along front lot lines for the
purpose of erecting and maintaining one or more of the following facilities:
storm sewers, sanitary sewers, surface drainage, gas mains, underground
electric lines, telephone lines, cable TV and such other utilities reasonably
required for an urban structure.
      2.   Easements shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') in width. A utility
may be located in the street right of way if the respective company so desires
and appropriate permits have been obtained.
      3.   Alternate locations for various utilities shall be decided upon by
the appropriate utility companies, subject to the approval of the village
engineer. In no case shall streets, permanent buildings or other manmade
improvements that obstruct surface drainage be placed on rear or side lot
easements.
      4.   It is the responsibility of the subdivider to notify all utility
companies, in writing, when the land to be developed has been graded in
accordance with the construction plans and is ready for installation of a given
utility. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-1991)
   B.   Location Of Utilities:
      1.   Utilities (sewers, electric, water and gas), whenever possible,
shall be located in the public right of way or front lot easement in the
following manner: water and electric lines shall be located on the south and
east sides; sanitary sewer and gas lines shall be located on the north and west
sides. In some cases, however, electric lines may also be located on the north
and west sides. Storm sewers shall be located under the pavement near, but not
in, the center. Where a customer is to be located on the opposite side of the
street from the main, the village shall require, as part of the approved
construction plans, that the subdivider make a service connection at the main,
and that the subdivider run the service line or lateral under the street and
cap or stub the service line in an appropriate manner. (Ord. 02-05, 5-13-2002)

IMAGES/0-0-0-1271.gif]
      2.   The placement of storm sewers or electric lines in the rear of a lot
is strongly disfavored. Such a practice shall be allowed only upon the
developer's demonstration to the satisfaction of the village engineer that
circumstances absolutely require their placement in the rear, in which case the
following easement diagrams indicate placement:
         a.   Ten Foot Easements: When an easement will not include sanitary
sewer or surface drainage systems, a ten foot (10') easement width shall be
sufficient and the utilities shall be located as follows:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d18776164540c6c74ffab4ee65460cf51605f293/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1273.gif]
         b.   Fifteen Foot Easements: When an easement will include either a
sanitary sewer system or a surface drainage system, but not both systems, a
fifteen foot (15') easement shall be required and the utilities shall be
located as follows:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d18776164540c6c74ffab4ee65460cf51605f293/

IMAGES/0-0-0-1277.gif]
         c.   Twenty Foot Easements: When a utility easement will include both
a sanitary sewer system and a surface drainage system, a twenty foot (20')
easement shall be required and the utilities shall be located as follows:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d18776164540c6c74ffab4ee65460cf51605f293/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1279.gif]
         d.   Ten-Foot Access Easement: When sanitary or storm sewers are
located in the rear of a lot, a ten foot (10') easement in the side yard shall
be required from the street right of way to each manhole or inlet. (Ord. 91-14,
9-23-91)
10-7-7: SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE:
   A.   All subdivisions shall be developed with adequate surface drainage.
Surface water drainage improvements shall consist of storm sewers and/or open
channels, inlets, catch basins and manholes designed and constructed to conform
with the standards established by the Village Engineer and shall adequately
drain the area being developed, including drainage from other areas which
naturally drain through the area being developed.
   B.   If, as a result of the subdivision development, surface water is
deposited in existing roadside ditches in quantities exceeding their capacity,
the developer shall improve the ditches and replace culverts as needed to
handle the flow.
   C.   Unless engineering evidence is presented to the Village Engineer
warranting exceptions, storm sewers which will drain twenty (20) acres or less
for residential development shall be designed and constructed to meet the
following criteria:
      Major and minor arterials - 10 year storm frequency
      All other areas - 5 year storm frequency
   D.   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide grade
control for rear lot drainage to each lot owner. It shall be the lot owner's
responsibility to maintain the drainage course and to keep it free from
features that restrict natural drainage.
   E.   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff shall
be required in combination for all of the areas indicated on the preliminary
plan.
      1.   The controlled release of storm water runoff shall not exceed the
release or discharge rate which existed at the site prior to development. This
rate shall be known as the pre-developed discharge rate. In the case of
multiple discharge locations, no location shall discharge at a rate higher than
the pre-developed discharge rate for that location under any set of conditions.
The controlled release rate in any case shall not exceed the rated capacity of
the existing natural downstream outlet channel or storm sewer system as
determined by the Village Engineer. The rate at which storm water runoff is
transported to a designated storage area may be as determined by the design
engineer and is unrestricted.
      2.   A natural or surface channel system shall be designed with adequate
capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all tributary upstream areas
through the development. This by-pass channel shall be designed to carry the
peak rate of runoff from a 50-year storm assuming all storm sewers are blocked
and that the upstream areas are fully developed and have been saturated with
antecedent rainfall. No habitable structures shall be constructed within this
channel; however, streets and parking or playground areas and utility easements
shall be considered compatible primary uses.
      3.   Storm water runoff capacity of detention facilities and discharge
rates from such facilities shall be calculated by analyzing volume and rate of
runoff during pre- and post- development conditions for the 10-year and the
100-year recurrence intervals.
         a.   Storage capacity and discharge rates shall be based on the
maximum calculated volume and peak flow of storm waters, respectively.
         b.   Storage facilities shall be designed using the Soil Conservation
Service (SS) method of calculating runoff discharge rate and total volume of
storage. The rational method of calculating runoff may be used for subdivisions
less than twenty (20) acres.
         c.   The storage volume shall be provided for the fully developed
watershed that is tributary to the area designated for detention purposes. The
control structure for discharge shall maintain the release rate at or below the
rate established in subsection E1 hereof for all rainfall events of 100-year or
less frequency.
      4.   a. Detention reservoirs or bottom storm water storage areas shall be
designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types
of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent
flooding. A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains, and both shall be provided with a
positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or other storm sewer facility with
adequate capacity. The combination of storage of the water from a 100-year
storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in
excess of seventy two (72) hours. Maximum depths of planned storm water storage
shall not exceed four feet (4') unless the existing natural ground contours and
other conditions lend themselves to greater storage depth, which shall be
approved by the Village Engineer. Minimum grades for turf areas shall be four-
tenths of one percent (0.4%) and maximum slopes shall be ten percent (10%).
Storage area side slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land contours as
practical and a ten percent (10%) slope or less shall be used whenever
possible. If slopes greater than ten percent (10%) are necessary to meet
storage requirements or area restrictions, approval shall be obtained from the
Village Engineer, and suitable erosion control shall be provided in addition to
the protection required to insure public health and safety.
         b.   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible
and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper
operation. Each storm water storage area shall be provided with a method of
emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year return
frequency storm occurs. The emergency overflow facility shall be designed to
function without maintenance and/or attention and shall become part of the
natural or surface channel system described in a preceding paragraph. Hydraulic
calculations shall protect the public health and safety. Storm water runoff
velocities shall be kept to a minimum and turbulent conditions at an outfall
control structure will not be permitted without complete protection for the
public safety. The use of restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and
shall be used only as a last resort when no other method is feasible.
      5.   Retention reservoir or wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be
designed with all of the items required for detention reservoir storage areas;
except, that a low flow conduit and a system of drains with a positive gravity
outlet shall not be required. However, the following additional conditions
shall be complied with:
         a.   Water surface area shall not exceed one-tenth (1/10) of the
tributary drainage area.
         b.   Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from
wave action.
         c.   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet (4'). If fish are
to be used to keep the pond clean, a minimum of one-fourth (1/4) of the pond
area shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') deep.
         d.   Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond
level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline
maintenance.
         e.   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed to
operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface water
level. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design
features.
         f.   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided,
if necessary. Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these
aeration facilities shall be submitted with construction plans. Agreement for
the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be
prepared to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer and Plan Commission.
      6.   Where developments form only a portion of the watershed or contain
portions of several watersheds, the requirements for providing storage shall be
based upon that proportion of the area being developed as compared to the total
watershed tributary to the storage area. Compensating storage will be
acceptable whenever it is justified and feasible. As a watershed is developed
with a series of storm water storage facilities, due consideration will be
given for calculations of the allowable release rate and capacity of the
natural or surface channel system as described in subsection E2 hereof.
      7.   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash flood runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for
stormwater runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earthmoving or
drainage construction on the project site.
      8.   The construction of the stormwater control systems shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide certain benefits to the surrounding
properties, negotiations for public participation in the cost of such
development may be feasible.
      9.   The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge
capacity of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the stormwater
runoff control system as provided in subsection E4 of this section shall give
due consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for the
reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and/
or roofed over. The use of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of
storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention
of existing topography are samples of possible recharge methods.
      10.   During the construction phase of land development, facilities shall
be provided by appropriate stock-pile design, to prevent the erosion and
washing away of the earth. Silting of downstream areas shall be prevented
through the strategic use of silting basins, sodding of runoff channels, and by
limiting the period of time during which the earth is stripped of vegetation.
      11.   Final engineering plans shall show complete details for all items
covered in this section. Plans, specifications and all calculations for
stormwater runoff control shall be submitted for review and approval as part of
the construction plan submittal or as part of the site plan submittal for large
scale developments.
      12.   Stormwater control systems, other than underground storm sewers are
not public improvements and will not be dedicated to the Village. The
subdivider shall, through the subdivision covenants, make provision for control
over and maintenance of stormwater control systems by a homeowner's association
or other means acceptable to the Plan Commission and Village Attorney. (Ord.
91-14, 9-23-1991)
10-7-8: SIDEWALKS:
Concrete sidewalks at least four feet (4') wide and four inches (4") thick
shall be constructed on both sides of each street at least four and one-half
feet (4.5') from and at least four inches (4") above the backs of the curbs.
Sidewalks shall be located one foot (1') inside the street right-of-way.
Sidewalks shall be constructed along all streets bordering the subdivision.
(Ord. 91-14, 9-23-1991)
10-7-9: SEWAGE DISPOSAL:
   A.   Sanitary Sewers: When a subdivision is located within the service area
of a public sanitary sewerage system, sanitary sewers shall be constructed
throughout the entire subdivision in such a manner as to serve adequately each
building lot.
      1.   Public sanitary sewers shall be located in the north or west
boulevard (between curb and sidewalk) within the street right-of- way or in a
fifteen foot (15') easement behind the sidewalk within the house setback area.
Parallel sewer lines along the street may be used. Sanitary sewers shall not be
located in the rear yard.
      2.   Under no circumstances shall the entrance of stormwater or ground
water to the sanitary sewers be permitted.
      3.   All sanitary sewer collections and disposal systems shall comply
with the ordinances of the Village, including title 7, chapter 3 of this Code,
and the requirements of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
   B.   Private Sewage Disposal Systems: Where no public sanitary sewerage
system is available, individual sanitary disposal systems shall be installed to
service individual dwelling units according to conditions set forth in section
10-2-3 of this title. These sanitary disposal systems shall be installed in
accordance with the latest revised edition of the Illinois Private Sewage
Disposal Licensing Act and Private Sewage Disposal Code promulgated by the
Illinois Department of Public Health and the applicable ordinance of the
Village. Sufficient area shall be provided to accommodate two (2) seepage
fields. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-1991)
10-7-10: WATER SUPPLY:
   A.   Public Water Supply:
      1.   Water mains not less than six inches (6") in diameter shall be
constructed throughout the entire subdivision. Larger diameter pipes may be
required by the Village to provide for future transmission needs, in which
case, the Village shall pay any additional costs.
      2.   Every water supply system shall be designed in such a manner as to
provide an area fire flow meeting the requirements established by the Pawnee
Fire Protection District. Water mains larger than six inches (6") in diameter
shall be installed at the subdivider's expense if needed to provide the area
fire flow required by the Insurance Services Office Guild for determination of
required fire flow. A minimum of one thousand (1,000) gallons per minute with a
residual pressure of twenty (20) pounds per square inch shall be required. Fire
hydrants with shut-off valves at each hydrant shall be installed throughout the
entire system at maximum intervals of six hundred feet (600') or less if
required by the Fire Protection District. All fire hydrants shall be three (3)
nozzle hydrants with threads as specified by the Pawnee Fire Protection
District and shall have flow characteristics similar to those of a five and
one-quarter inch (51/4") hydrant valve.
   B.   Private Water Supply: When a public water supply is not feasible and
the subdivision is outside the corporate limits of Pawnee, a private well may
be used. Wells shall be constructed according to the Illinois Water Well Pump
Installation Code. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-91)
10-7-11: ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION:
The underground electric distribution system shall be installed on utility
easements along front lot lines. Transformers shall normally be placed on every
other lot line with secondary conductors and distribution pedestals installed
on the opposite sides of the street. In some instances, transformers may be
installed on both sides of the street. All primary and secondary cables shall
be in conduit. (Ord. 91-14, 9-23-91)
10-7-12: STREET LIGHTING:
Street lights shall be installed along public streets in the Village by the
subdivider at intervals of no greater than every six hundred feet (600'). (Ord.
91-14, 9-23-91)
10-7-13: PUBLIC AREAS AND OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably
located and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or
neighborhood use as well as public service areas.
   B.   When a proposed school, neighborhood park, electric substation, water

trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days per
year.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any public or private facility which, if flooded, would
create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life
and health. Examples are public buildings, emergency operations and
communication centers, healthcare facilities and nursing homes, schools, and
toxic waste treatment, handling or storage facilities.
DEVELOPMENT: A. Any manmade change to real estate including, but not
necessarily limited to:
      1.   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
      2.   Substantial improvement of an existing building;

direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
   B.   "Development" does not include routine maintenance of existing
buildings and facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
practices that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
FEMA: Federal emergency management agency.
FLOOD: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation,
or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD FRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP: A map prepared by the federal emergency management
agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (SFHA) within a
community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or may not depict
floodways and show base flood elevations.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION OR FPE: The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot (1') of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
FLOODPLAIN AND SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Are synonymous. Those lands
within the jurisdiction of the village, the extraterritorial jurisdiction of
the village, or that may be annexed into the village that are subject to
inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of the village are generally
identified as such on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Sangamon
County, Illinois, prepared by the federal emergency management agency and dated
May 3, 2004. "Floodplain" also includes those areas of known flooding as
identified by the community.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.
FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE: A form published by the federal emergency management
agency that is used to certify that a building has been designed and
constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection
elevation.
FLOODWAY: That portion of the floodplain required to store and convey the base
flood. The floodway for the floodplains of Horse Creek and Henkle Branch shall
be as delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Sangamon County,
Illinois, prepared by FEMA and dated May 3, 2004. The floodways for each of the
remaining floodplains of the village shall be according to the best data
available from federal, state, or other sources.
IDNR/OWR: Illinois department of natural resources/office of water resources.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, that is

REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
SFHA: See definition of Floodplain And Special Hazard Area (SFHA).
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: a) any
project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local

under the jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this chapter.
Specifically, the zoning administrator shall:
   A.   Process development permits in accordance with section
11-1-5 of this chapter;
   B.   Ensure that all development in a floodway (or a floodplain with no
delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of section
11-1-6 of this chapter;
   C.   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to section
11-1-7 of this chapter are met and maintain a record of the "as built"
elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   D.   Ensure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
section
11-1-8 of this chapter;
   E.   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public
health standards of section
11-1-9 of this chapter;
   F.   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of section
11-1-10 of this chapter are met and maintain documentation of any variances
granted;
   G.   Inspect all development projects and take any and all actions outlined
in section
11-1-12 of this chapter as necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
   H.   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, state, and federal permits;
   I.   Notify IDNR/OWR and any neighboring communities prior to any alteration
or relocation of a watercourse;
   J.   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
   K.   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
and
   L.   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps, copies
of state and federal permits, and documentation of compliance for development
activities subject to this chapter.
   M.   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain.
   N.   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 04-02, 4-12-2004)
11-1-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator
shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet
the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      4.   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section
11-1-7 of this chapter;
      5.   Cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed engineer
or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   B.   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the zoning
administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to
be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled
after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is not in the
floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood
insurance rate map is subject to the provisions of this chapter. The zoning
administrator shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at
the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior
to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. (Ord.
04-02, 4-12-2004)

   B.   The zoning board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of section
11-1-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;

11-1-11: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
This chapter is based on a model ordinance provided and mandated by the state
of Illinois. The state of Illinois considers the degree of protection required
by this chapter to be reasonable for regulatory purposes and claims that the
model ordinance is based on available information derived from engineering and
scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that
development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from
flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the
village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 04-02, 4-12-2004)
11-1-12: PENALTY:
   A.   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure
to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the village board may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. In
such event, the village board shall direct the village clerk to notify the
owner in writing of such violation. The notice shall be delivered by hand or
shall be mailed, certified mail, return receipt requested.
   B.   If such owner fails within ten (10) days after personal service of a
notice, or thirteen (13) days after the date of mailing of a notice, to correct
the violation:
      1.   The village shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each offense; and
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   C.   As part of the notice, the village clerk shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
   D.   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 04-02, 4-12-2004)
11-1-13: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed severable and the
invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. (Ord. 04-02, 4-12-2004)

13-1-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting
of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are
to: a) protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas; b) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential
areas; c) minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; d)
strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary
option rather than construction of additional single use towers; e) encourage
users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas
where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; f) encourage users of
towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse
visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting,
landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; g) enhance the
ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such
services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; h) consider
the public health and safety of communication towers; and i) avoid potential
damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and
careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of these goals, the village
of Pawnee shall give due consideration to its comprehensive plan, zoning map,
existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for
the location of towers and antennas. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)

ZONING TITLE: Title 9 of this code. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-4: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   New Towers And Antennas: All new towers or antennas in the village of
Pawnee shall be subject to these regulations, except as provided in subsections
B through D of this section, inclusive.
   B.   Amateur Radio Station Operators/Receive Only Antennas: This chapter
shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under
seventy feet (70') in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed
amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only
antennas.
   C.   Preexisting Towers Or Antennas: Preexisting towers and preexisting
antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this chapter, other
than the requirements of subsections
13-1-5F and G of this chapter.
   D.   AM Array: For purposes of implementing this chapter, an AM array,
consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground system which
functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one tower.
Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall be measured from the
outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units
may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-
2002)
13-1-5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Principal Or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses under the zoning title. A different existing
use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the
installation of an antenna or tower on such lot.
   B.   Lot Size: For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zoning district regulations, including, but not
limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
   C.   Inventory Of Existing Sites: Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the zoning administrator an inventory of its existing towers,
antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the
jurisdiction of village of Pawnee or within one mile of the border thereof,
including specific information about the location, height, and design of each
tower. The zoning administrator may share such information with other
applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits
under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the
jurisdiction of the village of Pawnee, provided, however that the zoning
administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or
warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
   D.   Aesthetics: Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
      1.   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
      2.   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
      3.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   E.   Lighting: Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.

towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes and the
applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the village of
Pawnee concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said thirty (30) days shall constitute grounds for the
removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
   H.   Not Essential Services: Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this chapter and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
   I.   Franchises: Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify, that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the village of Pawnee have been
obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the zoning
administrator.
   J.   Public Notice: For purposes of this chapter, any conditional permitted
use request, variance request, or appeal of an administratively approved use or
conditional permitted use shall require public notice to all abutting property
owners and all property owners of properties that are located within the
corresponding separation distance listed in subsection
13-1-8B5b, table 2 of this chapter, in addition to any notice otherwise
required by the zoning ordinance.
   K.   Signs: No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.

dollars ($250.00) to reimburse the village of Pawnee for the costs of reviewing
the application.
      3.   The zoning administrator shall review the application for
administrative approval and determine if the proposed use complies with section
13-1-5 and subsections
13-1-8B4 and B5 of this chapter.
      4.   The zoning administrator shall respond to each such application
within sixty (60) days after receiving it by either approving or denying the
application. If the zoning administrator fails to respond to the applicant
within said sixty (60) days, then the application shall be deemed to be denied.
      5.   In connection with any such administrative approval, the zoning
administrator may, in a case involving shared use, administratively waive any
zoning district setback requirements in subsection
13-1-8B4 of this chapter or separation distances between towers in subsection
13-1-8B5 of this chapter by up to fifty percent (50%).
      6.   In connection with any such administrative approval, the zoning
administrator may, in order to encourage the use of monopoles, administratively
allow the reconstruction of an existing tower to monopole construction.
      7.   If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant's
administrative remedy shall be limited to filing an application for a special
use permit pursuant to section
13-1-8 of this chapter.
   B.   List Of Administratively Approved Uses: The following uses may be
approved by the zoning administrator after conducting an administrative review:
      1.   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or
antenna, in any industrial zoning district.
      2.   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with
the terms of subsections B2a and B2b of this section.
         a.   Antennas On Existing Structures: Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the zoning administrator as an accessory
use to any commercial, industrial, professional, institutional, or multi-family
structure of eight (8) or more dwelling units, provided:
            (1)   The antenna does not extend more than thirty feet (30') above
the highest point of the structure;
            (2)   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations; and
            (3)   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
         b.   Antennas On Existing Towers: An antenna which is attached to an
existing tower may be approved by the zoning administrator and, to minimize
adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers
shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such
collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
            (1)   Type: A tower which is modified or reconstructed to
accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower
type as the existing tower, unless the zoning administrator allows
reconstruction as a monopole.
            (2)   Height:
               (A)   An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller
height, not to exceed thirty feet (30') over the tower's existing height, to
accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna.
               (B)   The height change referred to in subsection B2b(2)(A) of
this section may only occur one time per communication tower.
               (C)   The additional height referred to in subsection B2b(2)(A)
of this section shall not require an additional distance separation as set
forth in section
13-1-8 of this chapter. The tower's premodification height shall be used to
calculate such distance separations.
            (3)   On Site Location:
               (A)   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on site within fifty feet
(50') of its existing location.
               (B)   After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation,
only one tower may remain on the site.
               (C)   A relocated on site tower shall continue to be measured
from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation
distances between towers pursuant to subsection
13-1-8B5 of this chapter. The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way
be deemed to cause a violation of subsection
13-1-8B5 of this chapter.
               (D)   The on site relocation of a tower which comes within the
separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as
established in subsection
13-1-8B5 of this chapter shall only be permitted when approved by the zoning
administrator.
      3.   New towers in nonresidential zoning districts. Locating any new
tower in a nonresidential zoning district other than industrial provided a
licensed professional engineer certifies the tower can structurally accommodate
the number of shared users proposed by the applicant; the zoning administrator
concludes the tower is in conformity with the goals set forth in section
13-1-1 of this chapter and the requirements of section
13-1-5 of this chapter; the tower meets the setback requirements in subsection
13-1-8B4 of this chapter and separation distances in subsection
13-1-8B5 of this chapter; and the tower meets the following height and usage
criteria:
         a.   For a single user, up to ninety feet (90') in height;
         b.   For two (2) users, up to one hundred twenty feet (120') in
height; and
         c.   For three (3) or more users, up to one hundred fifty feet (150')
in height.
      4.   Installing a cable microcell network through the use of multiple low
powered transmitters/receivers attached to existing wireline systems, such as
conventional cable or telephone wires, or similar technology that does not
require the use of towers. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-8: SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
   A.   General: The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special
use permits for towers or antennas by the planning commission:
      1.   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under section
13-1-6 of this chapter or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to
section
13-1-7 of this chapter, then a special use permit shall be required for the
construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
      2.   Applications for special use permits under this section shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements of the zoning ordinance, except as
modified in this section.
      3.   In recommending the grant of a special use permit, the planning

antennas within the village of Pawnee based upon existing physical,
engineering, technological or geographical limitations in the event the
proposed tower is erected.
      2.   Factors Considered In Granting Special Use Permits For Towers: In
addition to the standards for consideration of special use permit applications
pursuant to the zoning ordinance, the planning commission shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to recommend issuance of a special use
permit, although the planning commission may recommend waiver or reduction of
the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the planning
commission concludes that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby:
         a.   Height of the proposed tower;
         b.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
         c.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         d.   Surrounding topography;
         e.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         f.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         g.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         h.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in subsection B3 of this section.
      3.   Availability Of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, Or
Alternative Technology: No new tower shall be recommended unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning commission that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the planning commission
related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
         a.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         b.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         c.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
         d.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
         e.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
         f.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
         g.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
      4.   Setbacks: The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the
planning commission may recommend reduction of the standard setback
requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:
         a.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least seventy five
percent (75%) of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
         b.   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
      5.   Separation: The following separation requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the planning commission may reduce the standard separation
requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:
         a.   Separation from off site uses/designated areas.
            (1)   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot line of the off site uses and/or designated areas as specified in
table 1 of this section, except as otherwise provided in table 1 of this
section.
            (2)   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in table 1 of this section.

      6.   Security Fencing: Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
less than six feet (6') in height and shall also be equipped with an
appropriate anticlimbing device; provided however, that the planning commission
may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
      7.   Landscaping: The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the planning commission may waive such requirements if the goals
of this chapter would be better served thereby:
         a.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screen the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four feet (4') wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
         b.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
         c.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-9: BUILDINGS OR OTHER EQUIPMENT STORAGE:
   A.   Antennas Mounted On Structures Or Rooftops: The equipment cabinet or
structure used in association with antennas shall comply with the following:
      1.   The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than two hundred
twenty five (225) square feet of gross floor area or be more than fifteen feet
(15') in height. In addition, for buildings and structures which are less than
sixty five feet (65') in height, the related unmanned equipment structure, if
over one hundred fifty (150) square feet of gross floor area or eight feet (8')
in height, shall be located on the ground and shall not be located on the roof
of the structure.
      2.   If the equipment structure is located on the roof of a building, the
area of the equipment structure and other equipment and structures shall not
occupy more than ten percent (10%) of the roof area.
      3.   Equipment storage buildings or cabinets shall comply with all
applicable building codes.
   B.   Antennas Mounted On Utility Poles Or Light Poles: The equipment cabinet
or structure used in association with antennas shall be located in accordance

         a.   In a front or side yard provided the cabinet or structure is no
greater than three feet (3') in height or sixteen (16) square feet of gross
floor area and the cabinet/structure is located a minimum of fifteen feet (15')
from all lot lines. The cabinet/structure shall be screened by an evergreen
hedge with an ultimate height of at least forty two (42) to forty eight inches
(48") and a planted height of at least thirty six inches (36").
         b.   In a rear yard, provided the cabinet or structure is no greater
than five feet (5') in height or twenty five (25) square feet in gross floor
area. The cabinet/structure shall be screened by an evergreen hedge with an
ultimate height of eight feet (8') and a planted height of at least thirty six
inches (36").
      2.   In commercial or industrial districts the equipment cabinet or
structure shall be no greater than five feet (5') in height or twenty five (25)
square feet in gross floor area. The structure or cabinet shall be screened by
an evergreen hedge with an ultimate height of eight feet (8') and a planted
height of at least thirty six inches (36").
   C.   Antennas Located On Towers: The related unmanned equipment structure
shall not contain more than two hundred twenty five (225) square feet of gross
floor area or be more than fifteen feet (15') in height, and shall be located
in accordance with the minimum yard requirements of the zoning district in

subsections A through C of this section may be modified by the zoning
administrator in the case of administratively approved uses or by the planning
commission in the case of uses permitted by special use to encourage
collocation. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-10: REMOVAL OF ABANDONED ANTENNAS AND TOWERS:
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve
(12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or
tower shall remove the same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from
the village of Pawnee notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to
remove an abandoned antenna or tower within said ninety (90) days shall be
grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If there are two
(2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the tower. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-11: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   No Expansion Of Nonconforming Use: Towers that are constructed, and
antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or
structure.
   B.   Preexisting Towers: Preexisting towers shall be allowed to continue
their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement
with a new tower of like construction and height) shall be permitted on such
preexisting towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on a
preexisting tower shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   C.   Rebuilding Damaged Or Destroyed Nonconforming Towers Or Antennas:
Notwithstanding section
13-1-10 of this chapter, bona fide nonconforming towers or antennas that are
damaged or destroyed may be rebuilt without having to first obtain
administrative approval or a special use permit and without having to meet the
separation requirements specified in subsections
13-1-8B4 and B5 of this chapter. The type, height, and location of the tower on
site shall be of the same type and intensity as the original facility approval.
Building permits to rebuild the facility shall comply with the then applicable
building codes and shall be obtained within one hundred eighty (180) days from
the date the facility is damaged or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if
said permit expires, the tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned as
specified in section
13-1-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-12: SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR SPECIAL USE DETERMINATIONS:
The procedures for special uses shall be the same as in the zoning title of
this code with respect to a public hearing and approval of the special use by
ordinance of the corporate authorities. However, the following requirements,
peculiar to the telecommunications act, shall apply:
   A.   If the applicant shows that the antenna tower and the equipment to be
installed thereon meet all requirements of the FCC, the planning commission
shall disallow and disregard evidence regarding the environmental effects
(including interference) of radio frequency emissions, and the village board
shall disregard any such evidence in making its final determination.
   B.   All findings of the planning commission shall be in writing and shall
be based on substantial evidence.
   C.   Since the telecommunications act requires a written record, there shall
be a certified shorthand reporter present at any public hearing, and a written
transcript shall be prepared of any public hearing.
   D.   The village board shall not take final action on a special use permit
application until all fees required to be paid, including reimbursement of the
cost of an engineering review, have been paid. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)
13-1-13: SEVERABILITY:
The various parts, sections and clauses of this chapter are hereby declared to
be severable. If any part, sentence, paragraph, section or clause is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of the chapter shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 02-02, 2-11-2002)

14-1-1: GENERAL STATEMENT:
This title shall govern all matters pertaining to billing for water, sewer and
gas systems. In the event of a conflict between this title and title 6 or 7 of
this code, this title shall prevail. However, nothing in this title shall be
interpreted as limiting the reasons for which the village may terminate utility
services as set forth in title 6 or 7 of this code, affecting shutoff or
reconnection fees in title 6 or 7 of this code for reasons other than
nonpayment, or limiting the collection remedies and methods available to the
village under law. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-2: GENERAL INFORMATION:
   A.   The village of Pawnee utility billing office is located at 617 7th
Street, Pawnee, IL 62558. The utility billing direct phone number is (217) 625-
2941 and fax is (217) 625-7729. E-mail address is vpawnee@comcast.net (office
manager) and vpawnee2@comcast.net (billing clerk). Office hours are Monday
through Friday from seven thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. to four o'clock (4:00)
P.M., excluding holidays.
   B.   The utility bill consists of charges for the following services:
      1.   Water.
      2.   Sewer.
      3.   Gas.
   C.   There is always a utility bill associated with a property, unless the
property has no service lines and a sewer main is not available within two
hundred feet (200') of the property line. Properties may be subject to a
monthly minimum bill for gas, water and sewer. A facility fee will be charged
for both water and gas meters each month, no exceptions.
   D.   Utility bill payments can be made as follows:
      1.   By mail.
      2.   At utility counter inside village hall.
      3.   Drop box located outside village hall at the 7th Street entrance.
(Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-3: ESTABLISHING SERVICE:
Customers must contact the village of Pawnee utility office in person or by
phone to initiate service. A service worker will read the utility meters on the
date requested and the account is activated for billing if the procedures below
are satisfied.
   A.   New Customers:
      1.   Homeowners who have not previously had village of Pawnee utilities
in their name must apply in person at the utility office. Photo identification
will be required to open new account.
      2.   Residential tenants shall complete an application which obligates
the landlord to pay for utilities if the tenant fails to pay, and submit
required deposit before services will be offered. If the landlord signs the
application, thereby agreeing to be bound to pay for utilities if the tenant
fails to pay, the deposit required for water service is seventy five dollars
($75.00) and for gas service is one hundred seventy five dollars ($175.00). If
the landlord fails or refuses to join in the application, the deposit required
for water service is one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and for gas service is
three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00). The failure of a landlord to join in an
application does not absolve the landlord from joint and several liability with
the tenant, or insulate the property served from imposition of a lien for
nonpayment.
   B.   Nonresidential Accounts: The deposit required for nonresidential
accounts for water service is seventy five dollars ($75.00) and for gas service
is one hundred seventy five dollars ($175.00).
   C.   Existing And Prior Customers: Utility billing staff will request the
necessary information to update the account and initiate service. All account
balances for existing and/or prior accounts must be current before a new
account is established. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-4: LEVEL PAYMENT PROGRAM:
   A.   The level payment program is a program that allows the customer to pay
a set payment that is due by the fifteenth of each month. This monthly amount
is calculated based on an average of the customer's actual usage during the
previous year and may be adjusted from time to time to keep balance in line
with customer's actual consumption. This program begins in June of each year. A
customer agreement will be sent out in April that must be signed and returned
no later than May 15.
   B.   If payment is not made by the twentieth of each month, the village may
remove the customer from the level payment program and any unpaid balance will
become due and payable immediately.
   C.   Customer or village may terminate the level payment agreement at any
time by written notice, at which time all balances are due and payable. (Ord.
14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-5: MONTHLY BILLING CYCLE:
   A.   Payment For Service: All charges for gas, water and sewer supplied by
the village, and all other charges relating to utilities, shall be paid to the
village on or before the twelfth day of the month in which the charges are due.
   B.   Penalties For Nonpayment: All charges due and unpaid on or after the
twelfth day of the month in which they are due shall be assessed a penalty of
ten percent (10%) of the total amount unpaid.
   C.   Responsibility: The customer is responsible for all billings while the
account is in his, her or its name.
   D.   Monthly Billing Statement Schedule:
      1.   First Billing: Monthly utility statements are taken to the U.S. post
office for mailing on or before the first day of each month.
      2.   Nonpayment: If balance is not received by close of business on the
twelfth day of the month, an additional fee of ten percent (10%) will be
applied to the unpaid balance.
      3.   Shutoff Notice: A shutoff notice is mailed on or about the twentieth
of the month to the address of the account, which will include a ten dollar
($10.00) fee for the red shutoff letter. If the account balance is not paid in
full by the close of business of the date stated in the notice, the account
will be shut off without further notice.
      4.   Disconnect Fee: In the event of a shutoff, a forty dollar ($40.00)
disconnect fee is added to the customer's account. The utilities will not be
turned on until the entire account balance including any late fees, red letter
fees and disconnect fees are paid in full.
      5.   Hearing: A customer threatened with a shutoff has the right to
request an informal hearing as to the amount of the bill before the shutoff.
Hearings will be conducted by the office manager or other person designated by
the village president, during the regular business hours of the village. The
shutoff notice shall notify the customer of this right. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-
2014)
14-1-6: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Relating To Cold Weather: No gas service furnished to residential users
shall be terminated for nonpayment of bills on: 1) any day when the national
weather service forecast for the following twenty four (24) hours covering the
area in which the residence is located includes a forecast that the temperature
will be twenty degrees Fahrenheit (20°F) or below; or 2) any day preceding a
holiday or a weekend when such a forecast indicates that the temperature will
be twenty degrees Fahrenheit (20°F) or below during the holiday or weekend.
   B.   Relating To Master Metered Apartments: In the event of termination of
service to an apartment building having three (3) or more residential
apartments with a master meter, the village shall, in addition to the notice to
the landlord, notify all tenants of the building of the proposed termination of
utility service. This notice shall contain the following information: 1) the
specific date, no sooner than ten (10) days after the notice is rendered, that
utility service is subject to termination; 2) a statement of the tenant's
statutory right either: a) to pay the utility company from the rent due on the
rental agreement or b) to petition the court for appointment of a receiver to
collect the rents due for use and occupancy of the building and remit a portion
to the utility company for payment of utility bills; 3) the dollar amount of
the utility bills due and owing on the date such notice is given and the
average monthly utility bills; and 4) the name and telephone number of any
legal services agency within the utility company's service area where the
tenants may obtain free legal assistance. The notice provided to the tenants of
the building shall be of a conspicuous size, on red paper, and in at least 14-
point boldface type, except that the words "Notice Of Water Service
Termination" shall be in 36-point boldface type if the notice is posted, and
shall state:
      It is unlawful for the landlord or his or her agent to alter, deface,
tamper with or remove this notice. A landlord or his or her agent who violates
this provision is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.
The provisions of this section are in accordance with the rental property
utility service act, 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 735/0.01 et seq., and if
that act is amended, this section shall be deemed amended in accordance
therewith. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-7: PAYMENT AGREEMENT:
A customer may make a payment agreement, by which the customer shall pay twenty
five percent (25%) of the current billing (which includes 10 percent late fee
and $10.00 shutoff letter fee) at the time of signing the agreement, with the
remaining seventy five percent (75%) to be paid on or before the fifth of the
following month, or if the fifth of the following month is on a weekend, by
close of business of the Friday before the weekend. A customer may not have
more than one payment agreement outstanding at any time. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-
2014)
14-1-8: DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS:
   A.   Tenants: Tenants receive monthly bills as stated above. Tenants are
responsible for all billings while the account remains in their name. When a
tenant's account is subject to disconnection, the landlord will receive a copy
of the disconnect notice that was sent to tenant. In the event of
disconnection, a forty dollar ($40.00) disconnect fee is charged to the tenant.
The utilities will not be turned back on in the tenant's name until the entire
account balance and disconnect fees are paid in full. Except when the landlord
has signed the application of the prior tenant as set forth in section
14-1-3 of this chapter, a new tenant shall not be refused service because of a
prior tenant's failure to pay a utility bill.
   B.   Landlords: When a tenant's account is subject to disconnection, the
landlord will receive a copy of the third and final notice that was sent to
tenant. The tenant has a due date by which the delinquent account balance must
be paid. If the balance remains unpaid, the landlord can have services
transferred into their name and assume responsibility for the delinquency and
all future billings.
   When a rented dwelling for which a delinquent bill is owed is occupied by a
tenant, but the utility is in the landlord's name and the account is not billed
to the tenant for payment, no termination of utilities will occur unless the
tenant is first provided an opportunity to place the account in the tenant's
own name without incurring any liability for the landlord's delinquent bill.
   The village is not responsible for damage to property due to lack of
utilities. It is the landlord's responsibility to monitor the occupancy of the
landlord's property. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-9: RESTORING UTILITIES AFTER SHUTOFF:
Village employees cannot relight pilot lights. Arrangements must be made by the
customer to have some responsible person over the age of eighteen (18) present
to relight the pilot light when utilities are restored. The customer must
contact the village office to make arrangements to turn utilities on after a
shutoff. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-10: DELINQUENT/CLOSED ACCOUNTS:
   A.   Tenants: A tenant cannot have more than one account at any given time.
A tenant cannot start service at a property if the tenant has a delinquent
balance for any other village utility accounts (active or inactive). If a
tenant with a delinquent balance moves to another residence in the village of
Pawnee, the utilities will be in the new landlord's name until the tenant's
delinquent account is paid in full. Unpaid utility bills, in addition to
appropriate administrative fees incurred by the village to recoup delinquent
balance, not paid timely will be subject to collection in accordance with
section
14-1-17 of this chapter. (Ord. 14-17, 10-27-2014)
14-1-11: DISCONTINUING SERVICE:
When a customer requests termination of services a utility worker will read the
meters on the requested date of termination so long as the requested date is a
regular business day for the village.
   A.   Tenants: When tenants request service be discontinued and a new tenant
has not requested service, utility service will be placed in the landlord’s
name.
   B.   Landlords and property owners: As stated above, Landlords have primary
responsibility for utility bills for the property they rent. The Village will
put the bills in a tenants name for the convenience of the landlord and the
tenant, but the landlord has continuing and primary responsibility for those
bills. Utilities will be placed in the property owner’s name when the utilities
are not established with a tenant.
   A Landlord may request a disconnection of gas and/or water service between
tenants. When anew tenant applies for gas and/or water at said property a forty
dollar ($40.00) reconnection fee will be charged and paid by the Landlord.
   For property owners who will be vacating the property for more than two (2)
weeks, the Village will disconnect water and/or gas services per the property
owners request. There will be a reconnect fee of forty dollars ($40.00).
   For property owners or landlords undertaking repairs, and requiring
utilities to be disconnected only for the purpose of those repairs, the Village
will disconnect gas and/or water service per instructions from the landlord,
property owner, or contractor on the project. There will be no fee to reconnect
utilities, unless the village determines that no repair project has been
undertaken, or the landlord or property owner are attempting to avoid
disconnect fees by claiming the existence of a repair project.
   C.   Homeowners (Sale of Property): If the buyer has applied for service
meter reading is obtained on the scheduled date and future billings are
transferred to the new owner’s name. The meter is read on the date the seller
schedules and a final bill will be sent to the seller. If the new owner has not
